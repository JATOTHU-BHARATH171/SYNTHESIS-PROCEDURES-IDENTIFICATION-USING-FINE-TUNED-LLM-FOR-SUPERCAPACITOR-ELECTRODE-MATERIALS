demand for energy is increasing. However, it has become a consensus to seek new energy sources to replace fossil energy, because
fossil energy consumption is increasing year by year and the
problem of environmental pollution is getting worse.1–10 The new
sources of energy, such as solar energy, nuclear energy, tidal
energy, etc., have already become research hotspots because of their
cleanliness and regenerability. Nevertheless, these energy sources
have an intermittent problem, scilicet, no continuously supply,
which brings an enormous challenge. The key to developing new
energy technologies to realize the utilization and transformation of
new energy mainly depends on the research of new materials to
achieve the new type of energy storage devices.11–15 Therefore,
there is an urgent need for new technologies and devices related to
energy conversion and storageAs a new environmentally friendly energy storage device, the
supercapacitors (SCs) are favored for their advantages of rapid
charge and discharge, high-power density, good cycle life, etc.,
and have raised concern in this field overwhelmingly.16–24 In particular, the pseudocapacitors take advantage of Faradaic redox
reactions at the interface between electrode and solution. The
electrodes with high-level electroconductivity and immense electrical active surface area can achieve an elevated current density to
achieve better supercapacitor (SC) performance. Based on this, a
range of pseudocapacitive electrode materials, for example, metal
oxides (RuO2, MnO2, V2O5, etc.)25–28 and conductive polymers
[ polypyrrole (PPY), polyaniline (PANI), polythiophene (PTP),
etc.],29–32 have been researched and implemented to obtain the
preeminent pseudocapacitors, whereas most of the electrode
materials used have low electrical conductivity and low electrical
active surface area.
Foamed nickel (FN), a widely used transition metal material
with a three-dimensional (3D) network layered structure, has
high-level electrical conductivity, great surface area, and high electronic carrier mobility. NiO has a theoretical capacity of 2584 F/g
(0.5 V potential window), good chemical stability and thermal
stability, low cost, easy preparation, and other advantages.
However, the conductivity of NiO at room temperature is about
10–13 S/cm, which limits its charge-discharge ratio performance
and high-power energy performance. CeO2, an oxide of rare earth
elements, has been used in supercapacitors in the past few years
due to its good redox properties, environmental friendliness, and
low cost.33–35 A great increase in the specific capacitance of metal
oxides has been reported. Xi et al. have raised that single-handed
NiO/MnO2 was straight deposited on carbon fabric (CF) used as
a working electrode (WE) for the SC.36 The aluminum-doped lanthanum ferrite multiple electrodes have been reported as the SC
electrode by Rai et al. In comparison with the bulk materials,
nanomaterials retain excellent magnetic, optical, and electrical
properties.37–48 Wang et al. have investigated the electrodes composed of depositing CeO2 nanoparticles onto a 3D graphene
material, which has shown high specific capacitance and power
density and demonstrated that the combination of CeO2 and graphene has increased conductivity, which might result in strong
synergistic effects.49
Herewith, we report a strategy for fabricating ceria nanoparticles embedded in nickel oxide electrode material (NiO@CeO2). In
this work, the NiO@CeO2 sample has been compounded by a facile
hydrothermal and annealing process. The surface morphology and
the crystallographic structure of the as-prepared specimens have
been analyzed via X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and a scanning electron microscope
(SEM). Besides, the SC performance has been evaluated in 2M
KOH solution.

207_intro.txt.txt,"To meet the challenge of global warming, the Paris Agreement has
been made in the 21st United Nations Climate Change Conference in
2015 [1,2]. In this context, the substitution of fossil fuels by sustainable energy has been widely recognized as a promising route to reduce the emission of greenhouse gasses and put forward emerging energy storage devices [3,4]. Developing high-capacity supercapacitors
(SCs) based on non-precious materials is a promising strategy to reduce energy consumption. In the past decade, progress in transition
metal oxide-based supercapacitors was dominated by the development
of high-performance commercial supercapacitors. To date, rational electrode designs have already solved the poor cyclic stability and power
density of energy storage devices [5,6]. Unfortunately, the capacity is
significantly lower at low temperatures, which has been recognized as
a major challenge to be solved for an application of supercapacitors.
Considering the rapid development of electric vehicles in recent years,
this drawback largely limits the expanding applications of energy storage devices [7,8]. However, although external thermal control systems
could be an alternative solution, these systems increase the energy expense. Hence, a “green” system that avoids a capacity decrease of super-

capacitors at low temperatures is urgently required for expanding their
application in cold weather.
Very recently, Fang and coworkers developed a photothermally enhanced capacitor by employing the dark color of graphene [9]. Inspired
by this report, the development of capacitive materials with excellent
photothermal effect that increase the surface temperature is expected to
be an alternative to maintain the capacitive performance of supercapacitors in a cold environment. In general, a large number of charge-storage
reactive sites and a high electrical conductivity are the two key features
for the construction of ideal supercapacitive materials [5,10,11]. On account of the ordered micro-/mesoporous structure, tailorable components, and uniformly distributed active sites, metal organic frameworks
(MOFs) have been intensively employed as the precursors or templates
to prepare metal oxides and composite nanostructures for electrode materials in electrochemical energy conversion and storage [12–15]. Most
of the reports about energy conversion are mainly based on thermal
treatment [16,17]. However, conventional annealing treatment usually
results in a lower surface area and a low amount of electrochemically
active sites due to the elimination of micro-/mesoporous structures and
active sites at high temperature. Therefore, it is highly desirable to
develop a mild and effective strategy for the transfer of MOFs to the.rresponding metal oxide and composites with excellent electrochemical capacitive performance. Recently, alkaline hydrolysis has been applied in the conversion of MOF powders into the related LDH via replacing the organic ligands of MOFs by OH– ions, which are present in
solution in excess [18]. The resultant LDH powder exhibited a specific
capacitance of 1652 F/g at 1 A/g owing to the well-preserved microporous structure [18].
Energy storage materials with excellent photothermal effect under
solar light irradiation would be an effective and green solution to increase the capacity of SCs even in a cold environment. Herein, we
chose nickel foam (NF), a widely used electrode substrate with large
surface area and fast mass diffusion, as the substrate to design a highperformance supercapacitor with remarkable photo-to-thermal conversion ability. NiCo-MOF nanosheets were grown on the surface of NF
and converted into NiCo-LDH via a simple alkaline hydrolysis induced
by potential scanning. Electrochemical treatment not only maintained
the porous structure of the parent MOFs during mild OH– replacement
but also induced a large amount of oxygen vacancies in NiCo-LDH. In
addition to the superior capacity of 5.4 C cm–2 at 1.25 mA cm–2, the
resultant NiCo-LDH-coated NF exhibited a broad light-absorption ability, which endowed the electrode with a satisfactory photo-to-thermal
conversion efficiency under solar irradiation. A capacity enhancement
of 226.0% was obtained after 30 min of solar irradiation. The assembled asymmetric supercapacitor exhibited a capacity increase of 310.8%
even at a large current density (25.0 mA cm–2) in a low-temperature environment of –4 °C. This study offers an effective method for the rational
design and fabrication of low-cost and high-performance energy-storage
devices for application in cold weather"
208_intro.txt.txt,"With the increasingly prominent problems caused by the use of 
fossil energy and the increasing attention to intermittent renewable 
energy, new energy conversion and storage devices have been paid 
extensively attention by researchers [1–3]. In the past few years, 
lithium-ion batteries have been used for energy storage due to their 
high energy density and long cycle life. However, the safety of organic electrolytes, low reserves and high cost of lithium metal limit 
the further development of lithium-ion batteries [4–9]. As a promising alternative for lithium-ion batteries, aqueous Zn-ion batteries 
are increasingly playing an important role in various applications, 
mainly because zinc has abundant reserves and high theoretical 
capacity, and it is non-combustible with aqueous solution as electrolyte, and the low redox potential of Zn/Zn2+ [10–19]. Nevertheless, 
the low energy density and poor cycling stability of aqueous Zn-ion 
battery urges researchers to constantly explore new cathode materials. Up to now, various cathode materials for aqueous Zn-ion batteries have been investigated and reported, such as NiCo2O4, Co3O4, 
NiO, V2O5 and so on. Among them, Co3O4 is considered as a promising electrode material because of its high theoretical capacity 
(440 mAh g−1), low band gap (1.96 eV) and corrosion resistance in 
alkaline solution [20–25]. For instance, Tan et al [26]. synthesized a 
Co3O4 nanowire-assembled clusters electrode for Zn-ion battery, and 
obtained specific capacity of 173.6 mAh g−1 at a current density of 
1 A g−1. Wang et al [27]. synthesized an ultrathin porous Co3O4 nanosheets electrode for Zn-ion battery and obtained a specific capacity of 162 mAh g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. Although 
remarkable achievements have been made in the research of Co3O4 
cathodes, its electrochemical performance is still unsatisfactory. 
Much effort has been invested to develop and improve Co3O4 as 
an electrode in aqueous Zn-ion battery. One of the most effective 
methods of improving interfacial reactivity and kinetics is introducing oxygen vacancies. The oxygen vacancies not only adjust the 
electronic structure, the surface areas and the band gap, establish a local electric field and improve the overall conductivity, but also can 
provide abundant active sites and contribute to the electrochemical 
reaction, thus potentially improving electrochemical performance 
[23,28–32]. For example, Liu et al [33]. fabricated a MOF-derived 
oxygen-vacancy-rich Co3O4 electrode, and obtained an excellent 
specific capacity of 144 mAh g−1 and a current density of 1 A g−1. 
Tang et al [29]. synthesized an oxygen-vacancy abundant Ni Mnlayered double hydroxides electrode, and achieved a high energy 
density of 46.7 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 1.7 kW kg−1. Design 
and fabricate multidimensional Co3O4 electrode materials can enhance the surface areas and electrochemical active sites, which are 
beneficial to afford numerous pathways for electrolyte ion penetration for charge storage and delivery [34–37]. Therefore, it remains 
a critical challenge for us to design and build multidimensional 
oxygen-deficient Co3O4 electrode materials as high-performance 
electrodes for enhanced electrochemical energy storage performance. 
In this work, multidimensional oxygen-deficient Co3O4 electrode 
materials were fabricated via phosphorization treatment by using 
NaH2PO2 as P source, and then applied to aqueous Zn-ion batteries 
and asymmetric supercapacitors. The multidimensional nanostructure and oxygen vacancies are beneficial to the full contact between active materials and electrolyte, and increase the 
concentration of active sites for rapid redox reactions with electrolyte ions. As a result, the P-Co3O4 electrode exhibits an ultrahigh 
specific capacitance of 244.9 mAh g−1 at 4 A g−1. Furthermore, the 
assembled P-Co3O4//Zn battery and P-Co3O4//AC ASC device shows 
outstanding electrochemical performance, including high specific 
capacity, excellent stability and energy density."
209_intro.txt.txt,"Introduction
Advanced optimization of multifunctional material, to bring
forth an efficient amalgamation of energy storage and conversion, through an integrative approach, has taken great leaps
and bounds in the past few decades, empowering different
suites of ever-rising energy necessities. In this era of power
revolution, ultracapacitors are acclaimed to be one of the
desirable alternatives amongst the electrochemical energy
storage (EES) systems comprising metal-air batteries [1],
lithium-ion batteries [2], and regenerative fuel cells [3]. Multifold advantages including ultrafast charge-discharge capabilities, excellent thermal stability, straightforward operational
mechanism, high degree of portability, ultra-long lifespan, high
efficiency, and reliability, render them competent for wide
range of practical applications [4e10]. Despite of these, low
energy density and limited operational potential window are
the major bottlenecks that have hindered the large scale
commercialisation of supercapacitor technology. However,
asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs), configured from two contrasting electrode materials (e.g., one electrode belonging to the
EDLC category, while the other electrode being pseudocapacitive in nature), can offer wide operational voltage window,
thereby enhancing the energy density significantly [11e14].
Meanwhile, in terms of energy conversion, unconventional
electrocatalytic water splitting is considered as the most
expropriate (energy dense, carbon neutral, non-toxic byproducts) way of energy harvesting. Overall water splitting
process involves two half-cell reactions; oxygen evolution
reaction (OER), which produces molecular oxygen at the
anode and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which generates molecular hydrogen at the cathode. However, the process
of OER severely suffers from the sluggish kinetics due to
complex four electron reaction pathway and, in practice, involves higher potential energy than the theoretically established water dissociation potential of ~1.23 V, limiting the
overall energy conversion efficiency [15e18]. The state-of-theart electrocatalysts include compounds like RuO2 and IrO2,
which have excellent OER activities in both alkaline and acidic
media [19,20]. Unfortunately, their applications at industrial
level are greatly constrained by the prohibitive cost, inferior
stability and catalyst poisoning etc. Therefore, the idea is to
strategically screen; earth-abundant, highly active electrocatalysts with minimal overpotential, and providing long term
stability, especially under large current densities.
Extensive survey of transition metal-based materials,
including oxides [21e24], hydroxides [25,26], sulfides [27e29],
selenides [30e32], nitrides [33,34], carbides [35e37] and
phosphides [38e40], has been done to explore their multiple
functionalities. On the other hand, mostly, the first-row
transition metal (Fe, Co, Ni, and Mn) oxides possess superior reversible surface redox (faradaic) behaviour and promising catalytic properties which intensify their candidature as
electrode materials for energy storage (supercapacitors, batteries) as well as efficient co-catalysts for production devices
(water electrolysis, fuel cells). Manganese dioxide (MnO2)
exists in diverse polymorphic forms such as a-, b-, g-, d-, ε-, hand l-MnO2 phases, due to its multimodality of octahedral
[MnO6] building blocks (tunneled and layered structures)
[41,42]. Pioneering studies have distinguished that manganese dioxide have pertinence midst all other metal oxides
since it holds tunable valence states and excellent theoretical
specific capacitance (1370 F/g) in aqueous electrolytes [43].
Beyond graphene, development of a whole class of advanced
materials with morphological diversity, atomically thin
crystalline structure and rich physicochemical properties
reputedly known as “2D” materials. Considerable research
efforts have been devoted now for replacing particulate MnO2
by 2D MnO2 nano architectures to improved performance.
Despite of its low cost, high electrochemical activity and ecofriendly nature, 2D MnO2 is generally challenged, due to the
limited electrical conductivity (105
e106 S/cm) [44]. In this
regard, preferential study of composites with highly porous
carbonaceous conductive components, such as reduced graphene oxide [45,46], carbon nanotube [47,48], mesoporous
carbon [49,50], nitrogen doped graphene [51,52], activated
carbon [53,54], carbon fibers [55,56], g-C3N4 (graphitic carbon
nitride) [57,58] etc. have been emphasised in recent literatures to improve conductivity due to hike in active sites,
corrosion resistance and ion accessibility. However, the
build-up of active sites is inadequate to certain extent when
compared with the bulk charge transfer properties. Low
charge transfer ability of the bulk counterpart still needs to be
prompted for substantial improvement. To explore the full
potential of MnO2, scrupulous strategies need to be progressively developed to design smart materials.
Careful and deliberate manipulation of the anionic vacancies through defect engineering (generation and control of
vacancies) can have intriguing consequences in terms of
remarkable improvement in electrochemical and electrocatalytic performances. Some of the earlier reports on these
kinds of structural modifications were published in the mid
1980s, where the anionic vacancies were explored for electrocatalytic and energy storage [59,60]. Anionic vacancy [61]
content can be feasibly influenced via the introduction of
international journal of hydrogen energy 46 (2021) 28028 e28042 28029
aliovalent anion [62], redox treatments [63], irradiation [64],
annealing effects [65] or by pH-controlled ion imbalance [66].
In addition to the above, few works on the effect and formation of vacancies in birnessite d-MnO2 nanosheets has
been explored to date for multifunctional applications. But
theoretical insights for the modification in electronic properties due to formation of vacancies are yet not addressed in
details. The present work investigates, in detail, the physicochemical properties of defect mediated 2D d-MnO2 polymorph. Herein, an uniform nano-structurization is achieved
by a rapid and facile microwave-irradiated synthesis technique. Moreover, defects in the 2D birnessite MnO2 nanostructures have been created by an effective UV/Ozone
illumination to impart a multifunctional characteristic for
both energy storage and conversion applications. The evidence of defects and the electronic structures associated with
the defect system, and their applicability as bifunctional
electrode materials for supercapacitors and as electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction have been studied
systematically through rigorous experimental techniques
corroborated by detailed theoretical DFT calculations.
Experimental section
Detailed accounts of UV/Ozone (UVO) exposure
UVO exposure was achieved using an UVO irradiation unit
(ACS-40W4-UVO, ACS UV technologies, Bangalore) accompanied with four UVC Ozone producing lamps. The above tool is
responsible for photosensitized oxidation process this is in
particular includes three vital steps: ozone generation, ozonolysis and surface modification. A low pressure discharge
mercury lamp was essentially used as light source for emitting
wavelengths of ~185 nm (647 kJ/mol) and 254 nm (472 kJ/mol).
At the first instance, ozone (O3) and atomic oxygen are
generated by the decomposition of oxygen molecule present
in air medium at an UV illumination of 185 nm which can be
denoted as follows:
2O2 ! hw ð185 nmÞ
O3 þ O* (1)
Further, in the process of ozonolysis, ozone unbinds itself
after absorption of l ¼ 254 nm UV radiation to form O2 (
1
Dg or 1
Sg
þ) and activated oxygen atom. The reactivated process can
be expressed as:
O3 ! hw ð254 nmÞ
O2 þ O* (2)
In the end, high energy oxidizing atomic oxygen (O+) is
created in both the cases of formation and decomposition of
ozone. The reactive atomic oxygen moreover enables pathway
to promote enhancement of material property. For conducting
the surface modification effectively treatment of all the samples was accomplished at air atmospheric pressure and
ambient temperature.
Electrochemical measurement
The bifunctional physicochemical characteristics were
examined by Corrtest model-CS350 (potentiostat) at room
temperature. The cyclic voltammetry (CV), Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) study were operated to investigate detailed redox activity, OER efficiency,
intrinsic electron transport kinetics, stability of active electrodes respectively. Electrochemical features of individual
electrodes in 1 M KOH were recorded in respect of Ag/AgCl
(1 M KCL) as reference and Platinum spring as auxiliary electrode in typical three electrode frame. However the two electrode symmetric setups were tested by Swagelok cell
configuration.
LSV measurement for OER performances were carried out
in 1 M KOH electrolyte at a scan rate of 5 mV/s. In advance
electrode activation was ensured by running few cycles of
cyclic voltammetry at an intermediate scan rate. Voltage
datasets procured for OER versus Ag/AgCl were converted to
scale of RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode). Under standard
condition the net cell potential for OER can be expressed as,
EOER ¼ E OER
0 þ iR þ hOER
0 hOER ¼ EOER  E OER
0  iR (3)
wherein, E0
OER ¼ 1.23 V, is the standard oxidation potential
standard of water, hOER is the overpotential required for our
electrocatalyst to achieve 20 mA/cm2
, iR is the error to be
corrected in the potential value, R is the solution resistance
value obtained from EIS studies. Conversion formula for Ag/
AgCl electrode to reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) can be
defined by the following equation,
ERHE ¼ EAg=AgCl þ E Ag=AgCl 0 þ 0:059 pH (4)
wherein, E0
Ag/AgCl ¼ thermodynamic potential at room
temperature ¼ 0.21 V, pH ~ 14 for 1 M KOH electrolyte.
Computational details
The DFT calculations were formulated by assistance of Vienna
Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) through projectoraugmented wave method [67e70]. A cutoff energy of 500 eV
was utilized for plane wave calculations. All atoms were
permitted to relax with a minimum force of 0.01 eV/A. The
potentials for Mn and O were presented by projected
augmented wave (PAW) pseudo-potentials along with PBE
(parameter-free GGA functional developed by Perdew, Burke
and Ernzerhof) [71]. Monkhorst-pack k-point grids of 5  5  11
and 9  5  1 were employed to optimize the bulk and surface
geometries of d-MnO2 [72]"
210_intro.txt.txt,"Introduction 
The current industry of flexible electronics is demanding new characteristics for portable devices such as: wearability, flexibility, lowweight and long operating times [1]. In order to fulfill this last 
requirement, scientists are developing flexible supercapacitors (SCs) 
capable to generate high capacitances (100–3000 F g− 1
) and high energy 
densities (100–1000 Wh kg− 1
) while maintaining a high capacitance 
retention (>90%) [2]. In addition, those flexible SCs must be charged in 
short periods of time (1-5 min) and be discharged for hours (at least 
15-24 h) to satisfy the commercial requirements [3]. SCs are divided 
into 3 categories depending on the mechanism of energy storage: The 
first one involves the electrostatic accumulation of charges on the surface of the electrodes (no chemical changes occur in the material) and it 
is known as electric double layer (EDL). In the second mechanism, the 
electrodes exhibit redox reactions and the third way is storing charge in 
the anode by EDL while the cathodes store charge by redox reactions. 
The SCs storing charge with both mechanism are called “hybrid” [4]. 
One way to enhance the capacitance of these SCs is making their electrodes with graphene. This material has a high surface area (2630 m2 
g− 1
), low cost (100-300 USD per kg), high chemical stability and high 
mechanical resistance (~1 TPa) [5,6]. However, the capacitance offered 
by pure graphene electrodes is limited in the range of 100–400 F g− 1 
[7–9] because it can store charge only by EDL mechanism (this only

permits electrostatic accumulation of ions on the electrodes’ surface) 
and this is due to the scarcity of redox centers in pure graphene. On the 
other hand, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with high electrical conductivity 
(103
–105 S/cm), high surface area (2630 m2 g− 1
), interconnected/porous morphology, low weight and high mechanical 
strength (102
–103 MPa), have been widely used as electrodes for flexible 
SCs [10,11]. For example: Zhou et al. [12] developed a flexible 
CNT-based SC with maximum capacitance of 106.1 F g− 1 (at 5 mV s
− 1
), 
energy density of 2.4 μW h cm− 2 and high cyclability due to its high 
capacitance retention of 99% after 100 000 cycles of charge/discharge. 
Moreover, Hu et al. [13] fabricated flexible solid-state SCs with electrodes of porous absorbent cotton paper coated with SWCNTs. This device presented a maximum capacitance and energy density of 115.83 F 
g− 1 (at 1 A g− 1
) and 48.86 Wh kg− 1
, respectively. Further, Cherusseri 
et al. [14] developed flexible SCs using helically coiled carbon nanotubes (HCNTs) synthesized by chemical vapor deposition. The flexible 
SC exhibited a capacitance of 125.7 F g− 1 and energy density of 16.3 Wh 
kg− 1 at 0.28 mA cm− 2
. The devices were subjected to 15 000 cycles of 
charge/discharge and the capacitances only decreased <1%. Another 
study by Kang et al. [15] demonstrated that electrodes for flexible SCs 
can be constructed by coating office white-papers with CNTs. The best 
devices showed a capacitance of 135 F g− 1 (at 2 A g− 1
) and energy 
density of 41 Wh kg− 1
, respectively. Furthermore, these flexible SCs 
showed excellent stability because the variation of capacitance was 
below 3% over 4000 cycles of charge/discharge. Additionally, Gao et al. 
[16] used cellulose nanofibers (CNFs)/MWCNTs nanocomposites as 
electrodes for flexible SCs. Those devices exhibited a capacitance of 178 
F g− 1 and energy density of 5.06 Wh kg− 1 at 0.5 mA cm− 2
. The capacitance retention was 99.9% after 1000 cycles of charge/discharge. 
Finally, An et al. [17] fabricated a flexible SWCNT-based SCs, which 
reached a maximum capacitance of 180 F g− 1 and energy density of 6.5 
Wh kg− 1 (at 1 mA cm− 2
). 
In order to increase the capacitive performance of CNTs-based SCs, 
redox materials have been introduced in their electrodes. In this way, 
the charge can be stored by EDL and redox mechanisms at the same time. 
The most common materials used to produce redox reactions on the 
electrodes’ surface of SCs are: PPy (453 F g− 1
) [18], MnO2 (643.5 F g− 1
) 
[19], Ni(OH)2 (1065 F g− 1
) [20], RuO2 (1170 F g− 1
) [21] and V2O5 (262 
F g− 1
) [4]. However, synthesizing these materials at mass scale is 
difficult and the reproduction of the optimum morphology for the 
charge storage is hard, this limits their use for real applications. On the 
other hand, TiO2 can be fabricated at industrial scale, it presents low 
toxicity and its surface can be chemically modified easily [22]. 
Furthermore, TiO2 can be easily doped to create additional redox centers 
for the charge storage or to enhance the charge transport properties for 
electron extraction [23]. TiO2 electrodes doped with W, Ni, Mn and Co 
can produce capacitance values in the range of 220–360 F g− 1 as well as 
capacitance retention of 90–98% after 3000-4000 cycles of charge/discharge [24–27]. Due to these characteristics, TiO2 has been tested for 
SC applications: Tian et al. [28] reported N-doped porous carbon 
nanofibers which produced a capacitance of 251.2 F g− 1 and energy 
density of 28.3 Wh kg− 1 (at 0.1 A g− 1
). Such capacitance was 25% 
higher than that for undoped nanofibers. Furthermore, these N-doped 
nanofibers had a 99% of capacity retention after 2000 cycles of charge/discharge. In addition, Chen et al. [29] demonstrated that doping 
porous TiO2 with carbon enhances the capacitance from 283 to 485 F 
g− 1
. 
The use of TiO2 is promising for SC applications, therefore, it has 
been combined with CNTs to make electrodes for SCs with enhanced 
electrochemical properties: Huang et al. [30] fabricated solid-state 
supercapacitors with SWCNT/TiO2 electrodes. The SC showed a capacitance of 463 F g− 1
, energy density of 31.8 W h kg− 1
) and moderate 
cycling stability, since its capacitance retention decreased by 9.8% after 
2000 cycles of charge/discharge. Another report by Yan et al. [31] found 
that TiO2 nanoparticles uniformly coated by CNTs can be used as electrodes for SCs. In this case, the devices reached a maximum capacitance 
of 87.5 F g− 1 (at 0.5 A g− 1
) and energy density of 10.6 Wh kg− 1
, 
respectively. The loss of capacitance retention was only 5% after 1000 
cycles of charge discharge. Similarly, Li and coworkers [32] fabricated 
flexible SCs from CNT yarns decorated with TiO2, their device had a 
capacitance of 26.6 F g− 1
, energy density of 11.7 Wh kg− 1 and good 
capacitance retention of 92% after 1200 bending/twisting cycles. Lastly, 
Avasthi et al. [33] grew up vertically aligned carbon nanotubes 
(VACNT) by chemical vapor deposition and decorated them with TiO2 
nanoparticles, making a hybrid composite (electrode for SC). This 
nanocomposite presented 20 times (6.436 mF cm− 2
) and 102 times 
(0.041 μWh cm− 2
) higher capacitance and energy density than the bare 
VACNT without TiO2 nanoparticles when tested in three electrode 
configuration (the electrolyte was 1 M KOH). If we compare the results 
of capacitance obtained for the SC materials employing CNT/TiO2 with 
these obtained for the bare TiO2 treated at different conditions, we 
realize that the capacitance of the sole TiO2 is 20–30% higher in general. 
The presence of the CNTs in the SC electrodes is suitable to provide a 
higher mechanical durability, wearability and flexibility to the electrodes. For this reason, a new strategy is necessary to increase the 
capacitance of SCs made with CNT/TiO2 electrodes. 
In order to increase the capacitance and energy density of flexible 
CNT/TiO2-based SCs with respect to the values previously reported, we 
introduced porous Ni@TiO2:W nanoparticles (NPs) on the anodes of 
flexible CNT based SCs. To the best of our knowledge, nobody has 
studied the effect of porous Ni@TiO2:W NPs on the electrochemical 
performance of CNT-based supercapacitors. TiO2 has been chosen due to 
its capacitive properties mentioned above and we selected Ni NPs to 
decorate the TiO2 surface because they have a high conductivity and 
redox activity. Furthermore, TiO2 has been doped with W, which creates 
oxygen vacancies that act as redox centers, which greatly improve the 
capacitive properties according to the literature [34,35]. Firstly, we 
fabricated a reference flexible CNT SC without Ni@TiO2:W (TiNiW) 
nanoparticles and obtained a capacitance and energy density of 375.4 F 
g− 1 and 75.1 Wh Kg− 1
, respectively. Later, flexible CNT SCs were 
fabricated with TiNiW nanoparticles and produced a high capacitance 
and energy density of 549.1 F g− 1 and and 336.7 Wh Kg− 1
. Those last 
values are the highest reported so far for flexible SCs containing 
CNT/TiO2 electrodes to the best of our knowledge. Moreover, the SCs 
made without TiNiW nanoparticles suffered a complete discharge after 
only 600 s. In contrast, the SCs fabricated with TiNiW NPs presented a 
stable output voltage of 1.24 V after 550 min of continuous discharge, 
suggesting a battery-type behavior for this device. Overall, the results 
presented here suggest that adding TiNiW NPs into the flexible SCs could 
be an alternative to stabilize their output voltage and to increase their 
capacitive properties, this in turn, opens the possibility for their use in 
portable/wearable devices."

Over the past decades, electrochemical supercapacitors (ESs)
have gradually stood out from other electrochemical energy
storage devices, proting from their distinguishing advantages
of high power density, rational energy density and long-term
cycle stability.1–3 As is well-established, the electrochemical
performance of ESs is heavily dependent on their electrode
materials.4–7 Apart from commercial carbon and conducting
polymer materials, transition metal oxides have received
considerable attention owing to their good electrochemical
reversibility and high specic capacitance in aqueous electrolytes.8–11 Nanostructured tungsten-based materials (WO3 and
W18O49) are distinctly appealing in this regard owing to their
multiple oxidation states, high electronic conductivity (10 
106 S cm1
), small radii and suitable crystalline phases for fast
ion insertion and superior electrochemical performance.12–15
To induce more active sites during the redox reaction
process, strategies for the nanostructures of different dimensionalities such as nanoparticles, nanowires, nanotubes, and
nanosheets as well as 3D porous structures have been reported.16–20 Among them, nanowires are considered to be the
most promising structures due to their sufficient interfacial
contact areas with the electrolyte as well as the easy percolation
of the nanowire network. Furthermore, the electrical conductivity can be improved by compositing/doping WO3x with
conducting alien species.21–23 Recently, Gong et al. reported the
growth of carbon-encapsulated WO3x nanowires via a facile
hydrothermal and annealing treatment, achieving areal specic
capacitance of 786.8 mF cm2 at the current density of 20 mA
cm2
, but their rate properties were not satisfactory.24 Tian et al.
reported the production of W18O49 nanobers by the addition of
ethanol and electrodeposition of a polyaniline lm, displaying
specic capacitance of 440 F g1 at the current density of
1Ag1
. However, they could not display a long cycling life.14 In
all, all these reported structures cannot satisfy the commercial
requirements of high specic capacitance, high rate properties
and long lifespan. The major obstacle is that all these reported
carbon post-coated methods yield WO3x nanowires with only
surface-coated carbon materials rather than being conned to
a single nanowire and thus, the inner nanowire matrix fails to
contact with the exterior conductive carbon materials.
Herein, the structure of hierarchical carbon layer-anchored
ultra-long nanowires was proposed as a promising platform to
achieve high electronic conductivity and superior electrochemical performance. We projected that the WO3–ethylenediamine (WO3–EDA) inorganic–organic hybrid nanowire
framework with a unique structure and high specic surface
area can provide large contact areas with the electrolyte. Aer

a facile rapid thermal treatment, the anchored carbon layers
could be uniformly and tightly distributed in the inside of the
WO3x nanowires through oxygen bridges, which not only
signicantly contributed to the enhanced conductivity but also
helped enable an outstanding rate performance. Signicantly,
the reduction of carbon to WO3 resulted in the formation of
a large amount of oxygen vacancies in WO3x to achieve
promising conductivity. Notably, the as-obtained carbon layeranchored ultra-long WO3x nanowire (WO3x/C)-based electrode exhibited specic capacitance of 1032.16 F g1 at the
current density of 1 A g1

was increased to 50 A g1
, the specic capacitance of 660 F g1
could still be maintained. This extraordinary performance is
superior to previously reported values for WO3x-based electrodes, thus demonstrating the advantage of the carbon layeranchored nanowire conguration."

they have high-power density, which can be supplied in a very
short time. RuO2 [6], conducting polymers [7], and carbon-based
materials [8,9] such as carbon nanotubes [10], graphite oxides
[11e15], onion-like carbon [16] and activated carbon [17] have been
widely reported as electrode materials for liquid-state supercapacitors with sandwich [11e15], interdigital fingers [16,18] and
roll-like [19] shapes. However, at high temperatures these devices
cannot be recommended for use because the liquid electrolytes
suffer from decomposition. Moreover, these electrolytes exhibit
ionic conductivity which varies drastically with frequency and
temperature.
Solid electrolytes should exhibit high chemical stability,
considerable mechanical properties and sufficient thin film processability. However, the limited ions mobility constitutes the main
deficiency of these materials that undermine the power density of
solid-state supercapacitors [20]. Efforts to reduce this drawback by
developing thin solid electrolytes with higher ions mobility [20]
and more electrochemically active electrodes [21] are recently in
progress. Among universal solid-electrolytes, the protonconducting polymers have a high ionic conductivity [20] but they
exhibit a narrow potential window. In addition, maintaining a high
degree of hydration at low operating temperature is crucial to
achieve high performance on these electrolytes [20]. This represents a serious limitation to integrate supercapacitors in electronic

With the progress of society and technology, the global demand for 
energy has been increased year by year, and the research on energy 
storage systems has gradually deepened [1–5]. From various electronic 
components to various energy storage devices, the application of 
supercapacitors has become more and more extensive, showing great 
prospects. For lithium-ion batteries and zinc batteries, their performance, battery life and even safety issues caused by dendrite growth and 
complex side reactions are still unavoidable [6,7]. Comparatively 
speaking, supercapacitors have higher power density, higher chargedischarge rate and longer cycle life, while the low energy density is 
the main obstacle which impedes their practical application [8,9]. 
Therefore, it is particularly essential to design and develop new electrode material to improve the storage characteristics of supercapacitors. 
Thanks to the highly controllable physical and chemical properties, 
perovskites ABX3 have been extensively studied in many fields such as 
solar cells [10–12], magnetism [13], solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) 
[14–16] and catalysis [17,18]. The research of perovskite as an electrode material for supercapacitors becomes increasingly popular since 
the perovskite-type anion-intercalation electrochemical energy storage 
mechanism was proposed firstly by Mefford et al. in 2014 [19]. In 
general, the A-site is alkaline earth or rare earth metal ion with 12-fold 
coordination, while the B-site is a transition metal cation surrounded by 
oxygen octahedron [20]. Studies have shown that in SOFC, SrCoO3-δ 
perovskite with cubic structure exhibits higher conductivity than other 
structures [21–23]. However, it is difficult to obtain the stable cubic 
SrCoO3-δ at room temperature. By exploring the relationship between 
the different cation substitution and structure stability of SrCoO3-δ 
perovskite, T. Nagai et al. [24] found that SrCoO3-δ becomes more stable 
when substituting with Nb, Ti or Fe in B-site. In addition, excellent 
mixed ions and electronic conductivity (MIEC) can be obtained by 
substituting cations of different valences in SrCoO3-δ [25]. In the work of 
Zeng et al. [26], various cations were respectively introduced into

SrCoO3-δ perovskite by sol-gel method, such as Bi5+, Zr4+, Ce4+, Al3+, 
etc. It is found that only 5% cation substitution can make a great difference in the structure, conductivity and oxygen diffusion activity. It 
has been noticed that the conductivity and oxygen permeability of the 
cubic perovskites after substituting by ions with p6 configuration (Ce4+, 
Zr4+, Y4+, Sc3+, Al3+) were increased by 1–2 orders of magnitude owing 
to a high content of oxygen vacancies. Since the oxygen vacancy is 
widely considered as the key to determine the charge storage of 
perovskite oxides, it can be predicted that B-site substituted SrCoO3-δ 
will have a prospective electrochemical performance when used as 
supercapacitor electrodes. Tomar et al. [27] introduced a little Mo into 
SrCoO3 to ameliorate the electrochemical performance and the specific 
capacitance (Cs) was as high as 1223.3 F g− 1 @0.5 A g− 1
. In the further 
synthesized ordered double perovskite Sr2CoMoO6-δ, a Cs of 747.0 F g− 1 
was obtained [28]. The ternary ordered Sr3CoFeMoO9-δ (SCFM) also 
performed as an outstanding pseudo-capacitance material [29]. The 
symmetrical pseudo-capacitance SCFM//SCFM could obtain a Cs of 
232.8 F g− 1 @2.5 A g− 1 and an energy density of 58.5 Wh kg− 1 @1412.9 
W kg− 1
. By substituting Co with Nb in SrCoO3, Zhu [30] and Lei [31] 
both obtained high Cs of 773.6 F g− 1 @0.5 A g− 1 and 894 mF cm− 2 @1 
mA cm− 2
, respectively. In summary, substituting by high-valent cations 
in B-site can tailor the oxygen vacancy concentration and at the same 
time enhance the structure stability of SrCoO3-δ perovskite, which corresponding increase the electrochemical active sites and improve the 
conductivity. The effect of Ti on the stability of SrCoO3-δ perovskite has 
been proposed by T. Nagai et al. [24], and the Ti-modified SrCoO3-δ 
material was reported to have higher conductivity [22]. It is important 
to note that although Ti-modified SrCoO3-δ materials have been studied, 
those materials have not applied in the energy storage technology. 
Herein, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that Ti-modified 
SrCoO3-δ has been prepared for supercapacitor application. In the present work, Ti-substituted SrCo1-xTixO3-δ perovskite oxides were prepared and designed as supercapacitor electrodes. The structure 
evolution and the corresponding electrochemical performance with the 
variation of Ti content were studied systematically. Besides, the physical, morphological and electrochemical analysis of the as-prepared 
samples show the reason behind the enhanced structural and electrochemical performance of SrCo1-xTixO3-δ. The present work provides a 
novel perovskite system with an anion-intercalated charge storage 
mechanism for supercapacitor electrodes. "

energy storage devices such as electric motorcars and 3 C electronic 
products have developed with great rapidity. In recent years, the design 
and development of advanced energy storage systems with high energy 
density, high power density, long operating life and environmental 
friendliness have become extremely crucial research interests [1–4]. 
Supercapacitors possess the advantages of fast charging and discharging 
processes, long cycle life, safety, and environmental sustainability[5,6]. 
However, their low energy density pares down their application to a 
great extent. Rechargeable batteries have high energy density and 
power density but poor multiplicity and short cycle life[7–13]. In order 
to combine the advantages of supercapacitors and rechargeable batteries, hybrid supercapacitors have been developed[14–17]. Aqueous 
zinc ion hybrid supercapacitors consist of an anode undergoing zinc ion 
deposition/dissolution and a cathode undergoing ion adsorption/desorption[18–22]. In the era of emerging energy storage devices, aqueous 
zinc ion hybrid capacitors are still in their infancy. The anode material of 
aqueous zinc ion hybrid supercapacitors, zinc, has the advantages of 
high theoretical specific capacity (823 mAh/g), low standard potential 
(voltage is −0.76 V relative to the Standard Hydrogen Electrode SHE), 
and abundant storage capacity. However, cathode materials need further investigation. Activated carbon acting as a cathode material has 
poor ion diffusion and transport capabilities, resulting in poor multiplicity and cycling at high current densities[23,24]. Although ruthenium 
and hydroxides show significantly efficient performance, their harmful 
toxicity and high cost greatly hinder their practical application[25–29]. 
Spinel nickel cobaltite (NiCo2O4) is a perspective electrode material due to its large theoretical capacitance compared to single 
component nickel and cobalt oxides but possesses poor electrical 
conductivity and unsatisfactory cycle performance[30,31]. Therefore, 
a high-performance aqueous zinc-ion supercapacitor with enriched 
oxygen vacancies in nickel cobaltite nanosheets material as the 
cathode was reported in this paper. The enriched oxygen vacancies 
in nickel cobaltite nanosheets material offered higher electrical 
conductivity as well as superior capacitive performance[32–35]. 

Compared to the nickel cobaltite nanosheets before modification, 
the electrochemical performance was significantly high. "

between traditional capacitors and rechargeable batteries, with long

committed to designing the electrode materials for high energy density 
supercapacitor [7–9]. As stated by the charge storage mechanism, these 
electrode materials can be specified into two groups: double-layer 
capacitor [DLC] [10] and pseudo-capacitors [11]. DLC materials can 
store charges without any electrochemical reaction, though charge 
accumulation at the electrode-electrolyte interface. On the other side, 
pseudo-capacitor materials can store charges through the redox reactions or ion intercalation at the edge of the electrolyte and the surface 
of electrode. These pseudo-capacitor materials exhibit both high energy 
density and high-power density. These electrode materials are four 
types: Conducting polymers, Carbon-based materials, Hydroxides [12], 
and transition metal oxides. Conducting polymers exhibit poor electrochemical stability [13], whereas Carbon-based materials have good 
thermal and chemical stability, but it exhibits low energy density [14]. 
On the other side, hydroxides and transition metal oxides have better 
electrochemical stability and higher energy density [1]. 
The transition metal-based perovskite oxides are now being examined as potential candidates for supercapacitor applications due to their 
thermal and chemical stability and ability to contain oxygen vacancies. 
In the year 2014, Mefford et al. [15] proposed the charge storage 
mechanisms in LaMnO3 based on oxygen anion-intercalated pseudocapacitor. Recently, Liu et al. [16] also found an excellent oxygen-anion 
based intercalated pseudocapacitive behavior in Pr-based double 
perovskite PrBaMn2O6. This study also suggests that the doping of 
Ba2+in place of Pr3+in PrMnO3 creates oxygen vacancies in the material, 
which is the main requirement to achieve a high-performance supercapacitor. Here, we have replaced half of the Mn3+ by Zn2+ in PrMnO3, 
aimed to oxidize Mn3+ into Mn4+ due to charge neutrality in the system. 
By consulting different works of literature [17,18], it is evident that the 
coexistence of Mn3+ with the Mn4+ in different Mn-based perovskite 
oxides. The existence of Mn3+ in the system will bring oxygen vacancies 
in the material to maintain charge neutrality, which will play a crucial 
role in electrochemical properties. The charge storage mechanisms in 
Pr2ZnMnO6 (PZM) electrodes should be scrutinized to develop the 
innovative pseudocapacitor electrodes with robust cyclic stability and a 
high energy density. For the first time, the material PZM was synthesized 
successfully. In this article, we have employed X-ray photoelectron 
spectroscopy to finding the oxygen vacancy in the PZM. After that, the 
electrical conductivity, electrical impedance, and electrochemical 
impedance spectroscopy were used to investigate its electrical and 
electrochemical transport properties of PZM, respectively. Also, we will 
discuss how effectively this material is used for two different types of 
conduction. This material PZM opens a new area of research in the field 
of electrochemical applications for the upcoming years."

Thanks to its outstanding advantages, i.e. low cost, little 
environmental pollution, high reserves and superior theoretical 
specific capacitance (1370 F g-1), manganese dioxide (MnO2) is one 
of the most research-oriented transition metal oxides for 
supercapcitor electrode. There were several works reviewed the 
latest development of MnO2-based supercapacitors[1-4], and 
concluded that, for MnO2-based supercapacitors, a major issue that 
is critical to achieving excellent capacitance performance is the 
rapid transport of electrons and ions in materials or interfaces[3, 5-
7].
Recently, some researches pointed out that the one-dimensional 
porous MnO2 nanotubes which were connected together, had 
outstanding capacitance properties and were relatively worthy of 
further discussion[8-10]. The tubular structure usually has a large 
specific surface area, and can provide an effective ion/electron 
transmission channel in the longitudinal axis direction, so the onedimensional tubular structure can deliever higher specific 
capacitance[11-13]. Besides, the one-dimensional mesoporous 
MnO2 nanotubes also shorten the diffusion distance of ions and 
electrons, thereby promoting the occurrence of Faraday redox 
reactions, and improving the electrochemistry performance of 
MnO2 [14-16]. Although nanotube-like MnO2 can significantly 
improve the electrochemical performance of MnO2 (i.e. the design 
of favorable structure or morphology), only via the modification of 
it is still confined to some degree, because the low intrinsic 
conductivity of MnO2 is another major obstacle. Therefore, apart 
from morphology design, some scholars have combined MnO2
nanotubes with other conductive materials, such as carbon 
nanotubes(CNTs) [17] ， graphene[18,19]. Or doping heteroatoms 
that can dramatically increase the intrinsic conductivity of MnO2, 
which showed in our previous works[20]. However, only a few 
reserarches have reported that inducing defects in MnO2 nanotubes 
which further improve its electrochemical performance. 
Herein, we focused on synthesizing single MnO2 nanotube, and 
introduced oxygen vacancies into it through simple calcination 
approach. Numberous studies have also demonstrated the 
introduction of oxygen vacancies can effectively improve the 
conductivity of MnO2 nanomaterials[6, 21]. Based on these 
research, a neatly arranged δ-MnO2 nanotube array was prepared 
via a facile template method, and oxygen vacancies were 
successfully introduced by calcination in an N2 atmosphere to 
improve the conductivity of MnO2. The unique hollow mesoporous 
nanotube structure provides a large number of fast ion 
transmission channels, and effectively shortens the ion diffusion 
distance. At the same time, the introduction of oxygen vacancies"

The extensive use of portable and intelligent electronics has provoked ever-growing interests in the research of flexible electrochemical 
energy storage equipment. With prospective merits of unparalleled 
flexibility, excellent conductivity and remarkable power density, carbon 
fiber (CF) based SCs were considered as an emerging energy storage 
equipment and flooded with all kinds of electronics markets [1,2]. 
However, flexible CF SCs was still subjected to problems of low energy 
density and weak specific capacitances. Boosting energy density and 
specific capacitances of CF SCs were thus of great signification for 
widening extent about commercial applications in future intelligent 
electronics [3]. According to the equation: E = 1/2 CU2
, it was the most 
effective method for improving energy density of SCs devices to widen 
voltage window (U) or increase capacitance (C) [4,5]. Organic hydrogel 
electrolytes, solid-state polymer electrolytes as well as ionic liquids 
electrolytes can inhibit hydrolysis of water molecules, and widen 
voltage window to more than 2.0 V [6–8], but face the fatal flaws of low 
ionic conductivity, environmentally unfriendly, and high cost [9–11]. As 
a promising elective competitor, water-solvent redox electrolytes were 
drawing in innumerable advertences as far as ecological 
kindheartedness, minimal expense, and safe [12]. Crucially, adding 
redox substance to water not only can widen voltage window, but can 
enhance capacitance and ionic conductivity [13,14]. Among them, the 
[Fe (CN)6]
3− /4− redox pair is of great tremendous advantage owing to it 
dissolve well in water [15,16]. Particularly, diamond fibers were 
regarded as the best electrode material in K4[Fe (CN)6]/K3[Fe (CN)6] 
redox electrolyte for their outstanding specific capacitances and 
remarkable cycling performance [17,18]. However, its practical application was restricted by extremely expensive price of diamond. The 
usual approach to enhance energy density and capacitance of CF-based 
SCs is to load active substances on its surface, such as metal, metal 
sulfur/oxide, layered double hydroxide, MXene, etc. Take examples, 
Zhang et al. synthesized Ag/carbon fiber composite material, which 
greatly boosted the surface morphology of carbon fiber [19]. Kurra and 
Jiang et al. prepared a carbon fiber cloth loaded RuO2 and MXene 
asymmetric supercapacitor with excellent energy density and ultra-high 
specific capacity [20]. Even though CF-based SCs prepared by the above 
methods had prominent performance, they suffered from expensive 
materials and complicated preparation processes. In this respect, it is 
very necessary to develop new-type earth-plentiful, simply prepared and 
efficient electrode materials. "

The global trend of carbon neutrality promotes the development
of novel electrochemical energy storage and conversion (ESC)
technologies to alleviate the use of fossil energy sources [1–3].
Among various emerging technologies, hybrid supercapacitors
(HSCs) and urea electrolysis for hydrogen are considered as
efficient representatives to overcome the energy crisis. Specifically, HSCs are constructed to produce high energy and power
simultaneously via a combined non-Faradaic capacitive and
Faradaic battery-like energy storage process [4,5]. However,
compared with current cutting-edge battery technologies, one
major bottleneck of HSCs is the relatively low specific energy,
which is mainly determined by battery-like positive electrode
materials [6]. On the other hand, urea electrolysis is expected to
replace the conventional water splitting for producing hydrogen
energy in alkaline media, owing to its prominently lower theoretical potential at the anode side (−0.46 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode (SHE)) in comparison with that of water splitting
(0.40 V vs. SHE) [7]. However, the complex anodic urea oxidation reaction (UOR) involving six-electron transfer leads to
the low kinetics and hampers the overall electrocatalytic efficiency of urea electrolysis [8–10]. Thus rational design of lowcost and high-performance bifunctional electrode materials is
urgently needed for both advanced ESC systems.
Nickel-based layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have drawn
tremendous attention in various applications including HSCs,

lamellar structure and tunable transition metal compositions
[11–13]. In comparison with other types of LDHs materials, the
mechanism of nickel-based LDHs for both HSCs and UOR
involves the same redox reaction of Ni(OH)2 + OH− ↔ NiOOH

glycol. These NiFe-LDH nanosheets exhibit high UOR activity
to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm−2 with a potential of
1.35 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Therefore, the
oxygen-deficient nanosheet structure of nickel-based LDHs is
essential for realizing their outstanding supercapacitive and
UOR performance. The nanosheet structure is favorable for the
exposure of more active sites and the rapid accessibility of

supercapacitors have low cost and non-flammable water-based electrolytes, high safety, and do not rely heavily on complex battery management systems for protection, thus providing higher cost advantages and 
stability compared to energy storage devices using organic electrolytes, 
which becomes an important research direction of energy storage 
technology [1]. Alkaline batteries and supercapacitors are hotspots of 
the various energy storage devices that have garnered significant 
research interests due to their multitude of advantages, such as high 
specific capacitance, energy density, power density, long life cycle, and 
environmental friendliness [2,3]. 
Up to now, there are three main categories of electrode materials 
used in supercapacitors and batteries: carbon-based materials, conductive polymer, and transition metal oxides. Carbon-based materials, such 
as activated carbon (AC) [4,5], carbon nanotubes (CNT) [6,7], and 
graphene (GE) [8,9], account for a large proportion of the selection of 
electrode materials because of their stable cycle stability. However, 
these carbon-based materials have a limited capacitance [10,11]. In 
recent years, the application of conductive polymers such as polypyrrole 
(PPy) [12,13], polyaniline (PANI) [14] as electrode material is emerging 
due to the merits of cheap, environmental protection, wide voltage 
window, and good electrical conductivity. But conductive polymer 
materials still have many shortcomings, such as fewer types, single 
components, and expansion and contraction phenomenon that results in 
electrochemical performance attenuation in the process of electron 
intercalation and deintercalation [15]. Transition metal oxides can store 
charges like carbon materials and undergo rapidly redox reactions under 
a specific potential window. Hence, transition metal oxides can provide 
higher energy density than traditional carbon materials and better cycle 
stability than conductive polymers, thus becoming the focus of the new 
generation of electrode materials [16]. 
Among the various transition metal oxides, Co3O4 is an attractive 
material for energy storage devices, since Co3O4 has a high surface area, 
high conductivity, and a variety of mature synthesis methods [17,18]. 
Various Co3O4 nanostructures, such as nanowires, nanosheets, nanorods, etc., have been synthesized, which indicates the diversity of its 
preparation methods [19–21]. In addition, Co3O4 is easy to react with 
OH− in the alkaline electrolyte to occur a reversible conversion of Co2+
and Co3+ with an electron transfer reaction [22–25]. Despite these advantages, Co3O4 still has the problems of poor rate performance, low 
capacitance retention, and poor electronic conductivity, which significantly hinders its mass adoption [26,27]. In conclusion, exploring 
cathode materials with ultra-high rate, high capacity, and long life is still 
challenging. 
To date, various strategies have been proposed to synthesize and 
modify Co3O4 to achieve better performance. For instance, Wang et al. 
reported ultrathin Co3O4 nanosheets to apply to Zn-based batteries, with 
a high capacity and good cycling stability [28]. SK Meher et al. synthesized ultrathin layered Co3O4 as a supercapacitor electrode via homogeneous precipitation under hydrothermal conditions [29]. The 
electrode exhibited good specific capacitance retention, good structural 
and electrochemical stabilities. Still, Co3O4 cathodes face a considerable 
challenge with poor active sites and low electronic conductivity. To 
mitigate this challenge, exposing a high concentration of chemical reaction active sites and improving reaction kinetics are practical approaches to accelerate Co3O4 electrochemical performance. Generating 
oxygen vacancies (VO) in the material is one of the most effective engineering techniques that create massive active sites and reactivities in 
the electrode material due to its low formation energy [30–33]. Besides, 
optimizing the structure and morphology of the material to increase the 
surface area is also an effective strategy, which could shorten the 
diffusion and transmission path of ion electrons, thus showing a fast 
charge and discharge rate and high efficiency of energy conversion [27]. 
Herein, we design a high-performance defect-Co3O4@Ni (DCo3O4@Ni) hierarchical structure of the nanosheet composed of ultrafine nanoparticles with massive oxygen defects via NaBH4 reduction 
treatment. First, based on the characterization results, Co3O4 nanosheets 
were directly grown on Ni foam, avoiding conductive carbons and additives. Second, the ultrathin nanosheet is a hierarchical structure made 
up of many ultrafine nanoparticles, in which particle size decreases and 
the specific surface area increases, thus shortening the diffusion path of 
ions and the storage of electrolyte ions to achieve high rate performance 
[34]. Moreover, the massive oxygen vacancies can promote the active 
site and reactivity for surface redox reactions. Concurrently, these oxygen vacancies can achieve better charge transferability in electrodes, 
leading to enhanced activity. This double optimization combination 
strategy can significantly improve Co3O4 electrochemical performance 
in supercapacitors and alkaline Zn–Co batteries. This work used the 
as-prepared oxygen-vacancy-rich D-Co3O4@Ni nanosheets arrays electrode for supercapacitors and alkaline Zn–Co batteries. The asymmetric 
supercapacitors (ASC) were assembled by using activated carbon as the 
negative electrode and D-Co3O4@Ni nanosheets as the positive electrode. This novel D-Co3O4@Ni//C ASC displayed a high capacitance of 
237.32 F/g and reasonable specific energy of 64.6 Wh/kg at a power 
density of 350 W/kg. Moreover, when using the material as a cathode in 
an alkaline Zn–Co battery, it was able to show a high capacity of 119.74 
mAh/g at a current density of 0.1 A/g, which is nearly five times that of 
the original Co3O4@Ni nanosheets arrays electrode (25.58 mAh/g). 
Also, an excellent cyclic stability performance with no decay capacity 
was observed after cycling for 400 cycles at 1.5 A/g. "

The global trend of carbon neutrality promotes the development
of novel electrochemical energy storage and conversion (ESC)
technologies to alleviate the use of fossil energy sources [1–3].
Among various emerging technologies, hybrid supercapacitors
(HSCs) and urea electrolysis for hydrogen are considered as
efficient representatives to overcome the energy crisis. Specifically, HSCs are constructed to produce high energy and power
simultaneously via a combined non-Faradaic capacitive and
Faradaic battery-like energy storage process [4,5]. However,
compared with current cutting-edge battery technologies, one
major bottleneck of HSCs is the relatively low specific energy,
which is mainly determined by battery-like positive electrode
materials [6]. On the other hand, urea electrolysis is expected to
replace the conventional water splitting for producing hydrogen
energy in alkaline media, owing to its prominently lower theoretical potential at the anode side (−0.46 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode (SHE)) in comparison with that of water splitting
(0.40 V vs. SHE) [7]. However, the complex anodic urea oxidation reaction (UOR) involving six-electron transfer leads to
the low kinetics and hampers the overall electrocatalytic efficiency of urea electrolysis [8–10]. Thus rational design of lowcost and high-performance bifunctional electrode materials is
urgently needed for both advanced ESC systems.
Nickel-based layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have drawn
tremendous attention in various applications including HSCs,
oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and UOR due to their unique
lamellar structure and tunable transition metal compositions

LDH nanosheets with high-performance for both ESC systems.
Herein, we propose a facile one-step methodology to in situ
grow oxygen-deficient NiAl-LDH nanosheets on carbon fiber
paper (CFP). The fabricated NiAl-LDHs/CFP electrodes exhibit
superior supercapacitive performance and high electrocatalytic
activity for UOR. The novel electrodes are constructed with the
following features: (1) the eco-friendly in situ growth process of
NiAl-LDH nanosheets does not involve any organic solvents and
alkaline sources (e.g., urea, sodium hydroxide); (2) the architecture of petal-like NiAl-LDH nanosheets with abundant oxygen vacancies could provide plenty of active sites, promote the
intrinsic conductivity, and facilitate the interactions between
LDHs and electrolyte ions; (3) the as-obtained NiAl-LDHs/CFP
electrodes are free from binder or external conductive chemicals.
This work not only provides a new synthesis approach to prepare oxygen-vacancy-abundant LDH nanostructured materials,
but also highlights a path for their potential in realizing dual
functions as HSC electrode materials and UOR electrocatalysts."

223_intro.txt.txt,"With the increasing popularity of flexible electronic devices
such as flexible electronic displays, electronic-skin and wearable
devices, energy storage equipment with flexible, small, light and
high performance has become a research hotspot.1–4 Flexible
supercapacitors with a solid electrolyte are considered to be a
promising energy storage device for flexible electronic devices
due to their flexibility, safety and easy maintenance and being
free of electrolyte leakage, besides the advantages of traditional
supercapacitors (long cycle life, high power density and fast
charge–discharge rates).5–9 Meanwhile, researchers are also looking
forward to combining multiple functions into a single device.
Electrochromism is the optical property (reflectance, transmittance
and absorption) which can be reversibly changed by controlling a
small voltage, and in appearance, it displays a reversible change in
color and transparency. It is noteworthy that when the reversible
change is in the visible region, electrochromism is the coloring or
bleaching effected by an electron transfer process.10–12 The single
device that combines energy storage and electrochromic
performance can monitor the level of stored energy through color
changes, which has a wide range of applications in wearable
devices, visual monitoring and smart buildings.13,14 The functions
of energy storage and electrochromism in the device are achieved
through electrochemical reactions of electrode materials.15
Therefore, the development of electrode materials integrating high
energy storage and electrochromic performance is crucial and
highly desired for flexible solid-state supercapacitors with a visual
energy storage level.
The materials that have both energy storage and electrochromic performance mainly include conductive polymers (CPs)
and transition metal oxides (TMOs). Among CPs, polyaniline
(PANI) has attracted much attention due to its reversibledoping–dedoping mechanism, high theoretical specific
capacitance, high optical contrast, fast switching response,
multicolor change and mechanical flexibility.16–20 Lyu reported
that the PANI film was prepared by electro-polymerization
technology, showing an area specific capacitance of
3.7 mF cm2
, a rate performance of 27% (from 0.04 mA cm2
to 0.32 mA cm2
) and an optical contrast of 6.1% at a wavelength
of 633 nm.21 However, for the PANI electrode material, because
the pseudocapacitance reaction occurs on or near the surface, it
is difficult for the electrolyte ions to enter the buried active sites
in the electrode interior, resulting in its poor rate
performance.22,23 Moreover, the PANI electrode material undergoes significant expansion/contraction during charge–discharge
cycles, which may cause structural rupture and thereby decrease
its cycling stability.24–27 One of the ways to solve the problems
mentioned above of PANI is to construct a one-dimensional
shell–core structure with PANI as the shell and TMOs as the
core.28,29 The shell–core structure can not only provide a
short electron and electrolyte ion transport path in PANI to
improve its rate performance, but also reduce volume change
of PANI during charge–discharge cycles to improve its cycling
stability.30,31 More importantly, the energy storage performance
of PANI can also be improved by forming the shell–core
composite with TMOs as the core.32,33 Thus, it is highly expected
that the well-designed PANI/TMOs shell–core composites will
exhibit excellent comprehensive electrochemical and electrochromic performance.
TMOs have the advantages of high theoretical specific
capacitance, low cost, simple preparation process, and broad
optical performances.34–37 Among various TMOs, molybdenum
oxide (MoO3) has attracted attention as the promising material
for supercapacitors due to the advantages of unique twodimensional layered structure, simple preparation process,
short electrochromic response time, low cost, environment
friendliness, good thermal and mechanical stability.38 However,
MoO3 has low conductivity and a few electrochemically active
sites, resulting in its poor capacitance performance.39 Recently,
some studies have indicated that the introduction of oxygen
vacancies in TMOs could increase the conductivity and electrochemically active sites, and thus improve capacitance
performance.40–43 Wang et al. proved that the introduction of
oxygen vacancies in CoAl layered double hydroxides (LDHs)
could significantly enhance the specific capacitance of pristine
CoAl LDHs.40 Liu et al. reported that F-Co2MnO4x/CF achieved a
high specific capacity of 269 mA h g1 at 1 A g1
, and superior
cycling stability with 93.2% capacitance retention after 5000
cycles.41 Therefore, the presence of oxygen vacancies in MoO3
(labeled as MoO3x) is expected to provide high conductivity and
many active sites, thereby significantly improving the electrochemical performance and reducing the electrochromic
response time to improve the electrochromic performance.
Moreover, MoO3 nanobelts have a positive effect on the electrochromic performance of PANI. Therefore, the PANI/MoO3x
shell–core composites with MoO3x as the core are expected to
have the excellent energy storage and electrochromic performance.
However, to our knowledge, there have been no previous reports on
the PANI/MoO3x shell–core composites with visual energy levels
for flexible solid-state supercapacitors.
Herein, we synthesized PANI/MoO3x shell–core composites
as a bi-functional electrode material for energy storage and
electrochromism through a facile in situ oxidative polymerization
method. In the composites, the in situ grown PANI nanorods as
the shell provide high specific capacitance and electrochromic
performance, and the MoO3x nanobelts as the core contribute to
fast electrochromic response time, good rate capability and
cycling stability. As expected, the ratio-optimized PANI/MoO3x-2
exhibits a specific capacitance of 606 F g1 at 1 A g1 and a high
specific capacitance of 424 F g1 at 20 A g1
, showing good rate
performance, and obtains an optical contrast of 33%. PANI/
MoO3x-2 also shows good cycling stability with the capacitance
retention of 80.1% after 2000 cycles. At the same time, the
assembled PANI/MoO3x-2//PANI/MoO3x-2 flexible solid-state
supercapacitor provides an energy density of 10.1 W h kg1 at a
power density of 178.2 W kg1
, and maintains 3.6 W h kg1 at a
high power density of 1234.1 W kg1
, superior to the reported
PANI or metal oxide-based flexible symmetric supercapacitors.
In addition, three devices in series can power a LED for 90 s.
Therefore, PANI/MoO3x shell–core composites would be a
promising material for integrated flexible and electrochromic
energy storage devices."

Supercapacitors represent a special type of electrochemical energy
devices featuring irreplaceable power density, long cycling lifetime and
rapid charging-discharging rates, which have attracted intensive concerns in energy fields [1–3]. The charge storage of supercapacitors
mainly operates via two rationales: electric double-layer capacitance
[4–7] and faradaic capacity [8–10]. The faradaic supercapacitors can
provide superior specific capacitance by virtue of the pronounced redox
of electrode materials [11–13]. Therefore, the transition metal oxides/hydroxides, including Ni(OH)2 [17,18], NiO [19], Co(OH)2 [20], RuO2
[21], MnO2 [22], Cu(OH)2 [23], Fe2O3 [24], Fe3O4 [25], and Co3O4 [26,
27]. have been intensively investigated as faradaic electrode materials in
supercapacitors [14–16].
Amongst the faradaic metal oxides electrode materials, Co3O4 is
especially intriguing for the high theoretical specific capacitance (3560 F
g1
) through fast and pronounced faradaic reactions [28], and has been
recognized as typical faradaic electrode material. However, the recorded
specific capacity of Co3O4 usually falls between 300 and 1000 F g1
, far
less than the theoretical forecast [29–31]. It is deemed that the electrochemical performance of faradaic material is primarily dominated by the
surface or near-surface chemistry, the highly electroactive surface is vital
for efficient redox reactions [32,33]. To promote the utilization of electroactive sites, Co3O4-based composites are assembled by hybriding with
conductive and high surface area substrates, including metals, carbon
materials, and polymers, so as to remarkably improve the electrical
conductivity and specific capacity [34–37]. Liao et al. reported that the in
situ synthesized Co3O4/graphene hybrids via hydrothermal process was
capable of offering superior specific capacitance and cycling performance
[38]. The Co3O4 nanoparticles enwrapped by sulfonated graphene could
cause 2.4 times enhanced specific capacitance [39]. Liu et al. reported
the preparation of Co3O4/nitrogen-doped carbon hollow spheres via
hydrothermal reaction and subsequent calcination treatment, and the
resultant composite with hierarchical core-shell structure delivered
substantially enhanced charge storage performances [40]."

Supercapacitors (SCs) have attracted great attention due to
their advantages of low cost, amazing power density, highspeed charge and discharge, good recyclability and safety.1,2
Compared with batteries, there is still potential to improve
their energy density.3 According to the formula of energy
density, E = 1/2CV2
,
4 it can be seen that the energy density of
SCs can be increased in two aspects: the maximum output
voltage and the capacitance.5 At present, a strategy to enhance
the output voltage is to change the composition of the electrolyte, however, it is difficult for a water SC to exceed its own
thermodynamic stable value of 1.23 V under the premise of

and edge-abundant features provide incalculable possibilities
for further improvement in electronic activity.11–13 In addition,
CDs with low toxicity are considered to be more appropriate
luminescent alternatives compared with semiconductor
quantum dots.14,15 In fact, various CDs have been directly used
as electrode materials for SCs in early work. For instance,
assembled graphene quantum dots (GQDs)//MnO2 asymmetric
micro-SCs displayed an area energy density as high as
0.154 µW h cm−2 at 7.51 µW cm−2
.
16 However, their uncertain
electrochemical behavior and intrinsically low electrical conductivity extremely hinder their further growth in the electronic applications. Furthermore, engineering a host–guest
heterostructure within CD-based composites has been
reported to enhance the electrical conductivity, with the CDs
with electron-rich regions as the guest, and the other conductive carbon materials including graphene, carbon nanotubes,
carbon nanofibers and active carbon as the host.17–21 The
advantages of the host–guest heterostructure can be listed as

follows: (1) the CDs as the guest can effectively ensure
sufficient contact with electrolyte ions.22 In particular, the
abundant functional groups on their surface provide a multitude of active sites for much higher capacitance. (2) The supporting material or the host can offer the diffusion channels
of electrolyte ions.23 The host can also be regarded as the
intercalator, which can effectively reduce the aggregation of
the CDs. (3) Both CDs and other conductive carbon materials
usually contain π-systems, which means that a strong conjugate system may be induced in the interface between the
guest and host.24 Also, the volume change in the actual recycling process can be accommodated. For example, the CDbased composites with reduced graphene oxide25 and hierarchical porous carbon26 as the host and the CDs as the guest
exhibited remarkable specific energy densities and ultra-long
cycle life in different systems.
Nowadays, the growth of sustainable materials for practical
applications is extremely important.27 Motivated by the above
discussion, our research was also carried out based on host–
guest systems but attempted to greatly enhance the industrial
and economic growth of CD-based SCs from various aspects
including their cost, the source of raw materials and the complexity degree of preparation. On the one hand, we obtained
CDs with plentiful oxygen-containing groups via a simple onestep hydrothermal method to avoid the economic burden of
using some special and sophisticated equipment. On the other
hand, low-cost, scalable and industrially produced 3D graphite
felt was selected as the host. Apparently, the graphite felt
played a key role in accelerating the electron-ion transport rate
resulting from its enormous internal area and porous structure. Besides, the graphite felt can be suitable for many electronic devices owing to its high tailorability. Finally, an oxygen
vacancy-rich doped CDs@graphite felt-600 heterostructure was
fabricated by a simple dip-dry-carbonize method without changing the original structural features of the raw graphite felt.
Moreover, to validate the application of the electrode in portable energy storage devices, we have assembled coin cell SCs
with CDs@graphite felt-600, which exhibit superior electrochemical performances and become a low-cost and reliable
candidate for energy storage systems.
2. Materials and methods
2.1 Materials
Glutaraldehyde (GA), ethanol, and 50% aqueous solution were
brought from Kelong Chemical Reagent (Chengdu, China).
Kalium hydroxide (KOH, AR), sodium chloride (NaCl, AR), and
zinc chloride (ZnCl2, AR) were purchased from Sinopharm
Chemical Reagent. The graphite felt (thickness = 3 mm) was
brought from Jinglong special carbon graphite factory (China).
All the chemicals were used without further purification.
2.2 Synthesis of CDs
GA (15 mL) was mixed with ethanol (30 mL) in a poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (Teflon)-lined autoclave (100 mL) and heated at 150 °C
for 5 h in an oven. Next, it was cooled down and centrifuged at
8000 rpm for 10 min to remove high-weight carbon aggregates.
Then, the obtained brown solution was purified against deionized water via dialysis through an analysis membrane
(MWCO 3500). Finally, the CD solution was freeze-dried.
2.3 Synthesis of the CDs@graphite felt
The raw graphite felt was sonicated in acetone, ethanol and deionized water for 10 min, respectively. The graphite felt was
dried in an oven at 60 °C for 12 h. An aqueous solution was prepared by adding 0.1 g of CDs, 0.5 g of NaCl and 0.5 g of ZnCl2
into 10 mL of deionized water. Firstly, the cleaned graphite felt
(3 × 3 cm2
) was immersed in the abovementioned solution for
swelling. After absorbing for 12 h, the composite was dried at
60 °C for 12 h in a vacuum oven. Secondly, the composite was
initially maintained at 300 °C for 1 h in a tube furnace at a
heating rate of 10 °C min−1
. Next, the temperature was
increased to a certain level (500–700 °C) for 2 h at a rate of 5 °C
min−1
. The calcination process was performed under a N2 atmosphere. The composite was sonicated in 1 mol L−1 HCl solution
and deionized water repeatedly to remove inorganic salts.
Finally, the composites were dried at 60 °C for 24 h in a vacuum
oven and were named CDs@graphite felt-500, CDs@graphite
felt-600, and CDs@graphite felt-700, respectively.
For comparison, the GA@graphite felt was obtained similarly, except using GA instead of CDs as the modifier. The densities of different electrode materials are listed in Table S1.†
2.4 Electrochemical measurements
All electrochemical tests were systematically evaluated by using
a three-electrode system and conducted on an electrochemical
workstation (CHI760E, Shanghai, China). The CDs@graphite
felt-(500–700) and a platinum sheet were used as the working
electrode and the counter electrode, respectively, both of
which have an area of 1 × 1 cm2
. A saturated calomel electrode
(SCE) electrode was used as the reference and 3 mol L−1 KOH
was used as the electrolyte. The potential windows of cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were set in the range from −0.8
to 0 V vs. SCE. The galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) tests
were conducted at 3–20 mA cm−2
. Electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed from 100
kHz to 0.01 Hz.
Two-electrode symmetric SCs were assembled using nonwoven fabrics as the separator in the form of sealed coin cells.
The potential window was set at 0–1 V. The electrode diameters in the coin cell are 15 mm. The volume of the electrode
is about 0.3 cm3
.
In order to eliminate any uncertainty resulting from the
nonlinearities in the device’s discharge profile, the areal
specific capacitance C (F cm−2
), energy density (W h cm−2
) and
power density (W cm−2
) were all calculated by the integration
of the areas under the charge and discharge portions of the
GCD curves.28

226_intro.txt.txt,"Introduction:
Renewable energy harvesting through electrocatalytic water oxidation is intensely explored 
for the generation of carbon-free hydrogen fuel 1, 2
. However, the four-electron transfer 
oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at anode constrains the device's overall performance, 
limiting the wide-scale industrial application of water electrolysis.
3, 4 Ru and Ir based oxides
are best-known catalysts for the OER, but the high cost and low abundance of Ru limits the 
transition from lab-scale to a commercial product.
5, 6 The alternative earth-abundant elements
like Co, Ni, and Fe-based catalysts suffer from low electrocatalytic activity and stability.
7
Among the earth-abundant materials, Co3O4 has been considered as a potential candidate in 
the alkaline medium 8-12
. However, poor intrinsic activity and low electronic conductivity of 
the pure Co3O4 need further exploration to overcome the challenges which restrict its 
industrial application. The tuning of electronic structure by the addition of dopants, 
modulation of strain and charge densities (or oxidation state), the formation of 
heterojunctions, lithiation and delithiation of a catalyst in Li-ion battery assembly, and 
stabilization of polymorphic structures have shown a manifold increase in the catalytic 
activity.
13-17 For example, Zhiyi Lu et.al showed that the repeated lithiation and delithiation 
process extract Li out of LiCoO2, which results in Li0.5CoO2. The modified electronic 
structure possesses optimal binding strength for the intermediates of OER, which enhances 
electrocatalytic OER.17 (b) The operando studies suggest that the mixed valance present in the 
Co3O4 differs in their surface kinetics and electrochemical activity towards OER. Wang et al. 
decoupled the role of these mixed valances of cobalt in Co3O4 by simple ion-substitution,
Zn2+ for tetrahedral Co2+ site and Al3+ for octahedral Co3+ site. Further, Co2+ in the 
 
4
tetrahedral site is the active site for water oxidation in Co3O4 and is responsible for the 
formation of intermediates like CoOOH18
. While Co3+ has a strong affinity towards the 
-OH and contributes to double-layer capacitance formation, which limits its catalytic 
activity.
18 The density functional theory (DFT) based calculations suggested that the 
availability of Co3+ in the form of CoOOH provides surface stability and reduces the 
overpotential required for the OER.
17, 19, 20 The modulation of the mixed valence state on the 
surface of cobalt oxides to improve stability and activity has been explored by via techniques 
like doping, amorphization of structure, creation of oxygen vacancies by plasma etching and 
solution reduction method etc.
17, 21-23 Recently, Xiao et al. explored the dynamic nature of 
oxygen vacancies in spinel Co3O4 for OER and developed a structure-activity relation using 
operando techniques. The study suggests that oxygen vacancies help in the adsorption of -OH 
and facilitates the pre-oxidation of the lower oxidation state of cobalt (tetrahedral Co2+) and 
reconstruct the surface with intermediate CoOOH, which promotes the catalytic activity.
24
Further, the addition of oxygen vacancies in Co3O4 increases the defect sites, ECSA and 
delocalizes the electrons from Co-O bond and results in increased electronic conductivity,
which reduces the charge transfer resistance for OER.
17, 20, 24 A framework for the design of 
electrocatalyst are the volcano plots, where the mixing of two materials from the different 
legs of the volcano can enhance the performance.
25-28 Based on volcano based plots. Xing et 
al. mixed Co3O4 with V2O5, to form Co3V2O8, which shows a higher activity for OER 
compared to its parent materials.
22, 29
OER catalysts can be synthesized via wet and dry methods like electrodeposition, 
hydrothermal synthesis, and physical vapour deposition, etc.
29(b)-(d) Additionally, OER 
catalyst can be obtained through recycling spent Li-ion battery electrode materials. For 
example, charging/discharging cathode material like LiCoO2 results in Co3O4 formation, 
which contains OER active Co3+ sites that enhances OER.
29(e) Further, repeated cycling 
 
5
induces electrochemical amorphization of the electrode, which increases the ECSA. This 
study explores a similar strategy on supercapacitor materials to demonstrate that these 
materials undergo OER favourable structural changes upon repeated charge-discharge cycles.
In the present study, we are utilizing electrochemical capacitor charge/discharge cycled 
Co3V2O8 for electrochemical OER. We have found that the capacitor charge/discharge cycle 
helps in increasing the activity by ~6 times with respect to fresh catalyst due to the presence 
of an optimal Co3+
/Co2+
ratio on the catalyst surface. Further, these charge/discharge cycling 
generates the oxygen vacancies, promoting the formation of intermediate like CoOOH and 
facilitating the -OH adsorption for the OER reaction. The improved activity and its 
underlying mechanism are explored via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-Ray 
Diffraction (XRD), by inspecting the ratio of Co3+
/Co2+
and the amount of oxygen vacancies.
The electrochemical characterizations suggest that up to 2500 electrochemical 
charge/discharge cycle, the ECSA and the oxygen vacancy increases with a corresponding 
increase in the OER activity. However, further electrochemical charge/discharge cycles up to 
4000 result in the decrease in oxygen vacancy and the ECSA due to the continuous 
competitive dissolution of vanadium and increase of Co3+/Co2+ratio, which initially decreases 
the activity and then slightly increases the activity. After 4000 cycles, the electrocatalyst 
decomposes to the less active compounds like V2O5, resulting in decreased OER activity. The 
reaction mechanism insights are corroborated with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy 
(EIS) and Tafel analysis to identify the OER's rate-limiting step and different electrochemical 
resistances. The present study provides a general material design strategy and an 
understanding of electrochemical processes to optimize the electrochemically active surface 
sites.

the other hand, inorganic oxides easily interact with PANI chains, resulting in the synergistic 
behavior. The versatile properties of these hybrid materials, achieved either through the different 
degree of PANI‘s protonation or different oxide structures (obtained through numerous synthesis 
procedures), make their study inexhaustable. 
 While the investigations of composites with TiO2 were quite diverse and numerous, the 
studies on PANI/CeO2 nano-composites have mostly directed to the development of sensor 
technology including H2O2 sensors, humidity sensors, biosensors, gas sensing materials [6–11]. 
The positive influence of CeO2 particles, incorporated into PANI chains, has been recognized in 
many sensor properties. Besides, the binding of cerium oxide with the polyaniline was found to 
improve thermal [12,13], corrosion protection [14] and electrochemical properties [15–17]. Still, 
the studies regarding the Ce-oxide's influence to the charge storage properties of polyaniline are 
quite rare. Recently, Fei et al [17] showed that an indirect chemical bonding of PANI to CeO2
surface via its -OH and -NCO functionalized groups improves both electrocatalytic and 
capacitive performance of PANI. By mixing CeO2 with 10% of PANI, Maheswari et al [15] have 
significantly improved charge storage properties of oxide in HCl, from a very high value of 927 
F g-1 (for pure oxide) to the extremely high one amounting to 1452 F g-1 for the CeO2/PANI
composite. Also, Gong et al [16], have recently prepared nickel doped cerium oxide nanospheres 
at PANI (Ni-CeO2@PANI) as an electrode material for supercapacitors, which provided a very 
high capacitance of 894 F g-1 (at 1 A g-1), thanks to the defective nature of Ni-CeO2. The excess 
of reactive oxygen vacancies was achieved by doping CeO2 with nickel atoms, whereas the NiCeO2@PANI nanocomposite was prepared by in situ chemical oxidative polymerization of 
aniline in presence of Ni-CeO2 particles. Herein, polyaniline-cerium oxide composites have been

ability. The idea was to use the two types of CeO2-δ, containing different fraction of oxygen 
vacancies (without metal doping), in order to compare how the O-vacancy population influences 
the PANI-CeO2 interaction. The oxide’s particles were synthesized by two different methods: i) 
the solid-state method, yielding cerium-oxide with higher concentration of oxygen vacancies and 
ii) the hydrothermal method yielding oxide with lower concentration of oxygen vacancies. The 
influence of vacancy concentration of CeO2-δ oxides, in their composites with highly conductive
emeraldine form of PANI, on the thermal, vibrational and electrochemical properties of 
composites, was thoroughly examined. The mechanism of PANI-CeO2-δ interaction is proposed

231_intro.txt.txt,". Introduction 
Conventional energy storage devices like batteries, supercapacitors, 
and fuel cells are an unavoidable way of storing clean energy to fulfill 
the needs of mankind. The other ways of energy usage and production, 
which are dependent of combustion of fossil fuels, are affecting the 
world’s economy and ecology critically. So, demand of the renewable 
energy storage devices is increasing which are environment-friendly and 
having high performance. The unconventional energy devices like next 
generation batteries, supercapacitors (SCs) and fuel cells works 
rendering to the electrochemical energy conversion principle [1]. SCs 
have acquired much interest owing to prolonged cycle life, superior 
specific capacitance (Cs) and high power density (Pd). Also they are safe, 
requires no maintenance and it bridges the gap between capacitor (high 
Pd) and batteries/fuel cells (high energy density) [2–4]. This is one of the 
feasible solutions for delivering energy in rural areas, where no electricity is available. SCs can as well be utilized as power bank for portable 
devices like digital cameras, smart mobiles, laptops, etc. owing to tiny, 
lightweight and flexible. SCs can provide the high Pd needed for shortterm acceleration and energy recovery during braking in electric and 
hybrid vehicles, reducing energy consumption and safeguarding batteries from high-frequency fast charging-discharging (dynamic operation). The Ragone plot is employed to illustrate the Pd and energy 
density (Ed) (Fig. 1 a). This plot demonstrates how high-energy systems 
similar like fuel cells work. When compared to batteries and traditional 
dielectric capacitors, SCs, which are electrochemical energy-storage 
devices, can give better power and energy densities. SCs exhibit long 
cycle life with rapid charging-discharging process but they possess lower 
energy density than batteries.

one of the promising and prominent choices of active material for the 
fabrication of the electrode in energy storage devices. It is a leading 
group of nanomaterial in the electronics and electrical industries in view 
of its diverse constituents, grandeur, environmental affability, easy 
accessibility, high surface area and high theoretical capacitances 
[5–12]. TMOs act as a vital portion as an active materials for electrode of 
energy storage and present a high capacitance by altering and controlling the defects to produce an effective interfacial effect in a nanoscale 
regime [12–14] . However, these materials have shown a positive interest in the energy density but the low conductivity, uncontrollable 
volumetric transformation and slow ion diffusion in the bulk phase 
obstructed their realistic and industrial applications [15,16]. 
Consequently, it generated an urge to explore functional metal oxides 
with high electrochemical properties for SC applications. The engineering on the metal oxide nanomaterials concerned to composition, 
fabrication, electroconductivity and oxygen vacancies have amplified 
the intrinsic properties of the nanomaterial by promoting their intrinsic 
conductivity, surface area, stability, and active sites, etc. 
Foremost, TMOs are unique in terms of the co-subsistence of multiple 
distinct cations in a single crystalline form. These cations give rise to a 
greater number of electrons as compared to single element metal oxides 
which initiated the enhancement in the electrical properties. For 
example, the spinel oxides like NiCo2O4 owns a conductivity of two to 
three orders more than the NiO and Co3O4 [16]. Furthermore, doping

and defect construction also enhances the intrinsic property of nanomaterial by altering the conductivity. Nickel doping in semiconductor 
ZnO has manifested the electrical conductivity of the nanomaterial by 
reducing the band gap between valence band and conduction band 
[18,19]. Moreover, the doping in the material develops an extra redox 
reaction mechanism which reduces the charge transfer resistance of the 
structure in SC ensuring a higher specific capacitance without compromising the charging discharging time. 
Second, nanomaterials are more porous and provide larger surface 
area in comparison with bulk phase structure that benefits the electrochemical electrode to actively participate in the transportation of ions at 
the electrode-electrolyte interface [20–24]. The high thermal firmness, 
large amount of electroactive sites of TMOs ensure the high charge 
storage. 
Third, incorporation of carbon materials like carbon nanotubes 
(CNTs), graphene, carbon nanofibers, graphite, amorphous carbon with 
transition metal oxides facilitate the electrochemical reaction and 
enhance the specific capacitance and rate performances. There is no 
chemical change during charge/discharge processes of carbon-based 
SCs, they exhibit remarkable cyclic stability but the capacitance is 
limited due to the active electrode surface area as well as pore size 
distribution. [25] 
Fourth, an intentional creation of oxygen vacancies in metal oxides 
thrive a greater number of anion active sites, larger surface area, larger 
interlayer gap to promote the electrochemical kinetics and intercalated 
pseudocapacitance mechanism. Sinha et al., has developed an oxygen 
vacant non-stoichiometric W18O49 by an intentional creation of oxygen 
vacancy in WO3 which enlarges the band gap, intrinsic conductivity and 
surface area for better electrochemical properties in supercapacitor and 
glucose sensing [26,27]. Because of these features, the utilization of 
metal oxides has opened up the new ways for pseudo-capacitors and has 
moderately enhanced the energy density in terms of effectiveness 
without changing the power density with bridging the gap between 
batteries and capacitors. The designing and fabrication of novel porous 
nanostructures as well as composites of metal oxides is worthwhile to 
improve the surface area and remarkable electrochemical properties. 
Fifth, recently, a large amount of efforts has been applied for integrating nanomaterials to construct more efficient devices in the field of 
energy storages and biosensors. Nanomaterials have several different, 
outstanding, and useful functionalities which distinguishes it from their 
bulk structure [28–30]. For the electronics applications such as energy 
conversion, sensing performances, and photonics, parameters such as 
size, shape and surface characteristics should be modulated for controlling the properties with distinct applications of interest. Amongst 
several other modulating ways, methods of hybridization where the 
synergistic properties are different to the properties of individual components are beneficial. Presence of two or more different components 
allows a flexibility of tuning the properties of the nanomaterials. 
Maximum TMOs have pursued a high surface area, good compatibility, 
high chemical stability, and good conductivity. Mott et al. combined 
Gold (Au) with Platinum (Pt) for evaluating the catalytic properties of 
the combined nanomaterial. It is observed that the low catalytic property of Au is strengthened by the action of Pt synergistically [31]. Zhao 
et al. have extended the surface area and increased the electrocatalytic 
performance of ZnO nanorods by incorporating Au nanoparticles [32]. 
Yu et al. has developed a core shell nanostructure of NiCo2O4 over the 
Polyaniline by hydrothermal treatment and yields a higher sensitive 
glucose biosensor by core shell structure as working electrode [33]. 
Electrochemically redox materials like MnO2, RuO2, Ni(OH)2 and Co 
(OH)2 are suffering from poor mechanical strength in terms of brittleness and low conductivity which hinders its choice of becoming a device 
active material. Lima et al. and Choi et al. has effectively overcome the 
issues of brittleness and low electrical conductivity in their MnO2 
dispersed CNT based devices [34,35]. The augmented structure was 
engineered in such a way that the combined material retained excellent 
flexibility and mechanical sustainability. Another work conducted by 
Kadian et al. suggested a poly (3-hexylthiophene)-Titanium dioxide 
(PHT-TiO2) based nanohybrid structure which performed well for the 
highly sensitive and selective amperometric glucose detection in human 
saliva samples [36]. Chen et al., prepared a SWNT dispersed GO sheet 
core shell nanostructure and explored its advantageous involvement in 
optoelectronics and energy storage applications [37]. 
In this review, the entire domain of energy storage devices based on 
transition metal oxides are not a matter of concern, to be precise, the 
attention is diverted towards the fundamental principles and emerging 
strategy of hybridization of transition metal oxides for various energy 
storage applications. There is precise research in the field of hybridization of multi-components where it is desirable to maintain the characteristics of individual components during the synthesis. We initiate 
with an introduction of transition metal oxides and its hybrids, limitations and thereafter summarize the hybridization mechanism for 
supercapacitors with the help of hybrid electrodes. Furthermore, it is 
demonstrated and supplied that the controlled synthesis and logical 
design of the hybrid component are extremely important due to the 
careful tweaking of the properties and functions. Finally, the potential 
applications and extensive research being done on the investigation of 
transition metal oxide hybridization to create and build practical, firstrate, newly functional energy storage materials and systems. 
2. Supercapacitors and their mechanism 
Supercapacitors, often known as ultra-capacitors because of their 
extremely high capacitance. SCs achieve high capacitance in Farad (F) 
units. To manage the charge and discharge times and achieve the long 
life and high energy density, the SC employs the technique of physically 
accumulating the charge itself. The SC principle is based on the physical 
adsorption and desorption of electric charge on the surface of activated 
carbon. [38] Usually, two electrodes, an electrolyte and separator are 
main components of SC. [39] The anode and cathode electrodes of SCs 
are often separated by separators that permit the flow of ions and 
electrolytes (both aqueous and non-aqueous). 
According to their method of energy storage, electric double-layer 
capacitors (EDLCs), pseudocapacitors and hybrid capacitors (HCs), SCs 
are divided into three groups as shown in Fig. 1 (b). The charge storage 
process is brought about by the electrostatic storage of charges at the 
electrode-electrolyte contact. [40] Since no faradaic reaction occurs 
during energy storage, the charge/discharge process in EDLCs is the 
same as the dielectric behavior of regular capacitors. [41] In general, 
graphene, activated carbon, carbon aerogel, etc. are mainly used in 
EDLCs for charge adsorption/desorption process. 
Pseudocapacitors, also known as redox capacitors, are a subset of 
supercapacitors that store energy by a quick and reversible faradaic 
reaction on the surface of the active components. The faradaic charge 
transfer process that takes place on the electrode’s surface or a few 
adjacent surface layers is essential to the pseudocapacitors charge 
storage mechanism. Compared to EDLCs, pseudocapacitors have a 
significantly higher energy density and a capacitive range of 10 to 100 
times. [42] Metal oxides and conductive polymers are the most often 
utilized materials for pseudocapacitors. These materials provide high 
energy and power densities and have high specific capacitance, conductivity, and surface area. As a result, they were thought of as promising candidates for electrochemical energy storage. [43] 
The intrinsic qualities of both EDLCs and pseudocapacitors are 
combined in hybrid capacitors. The main disadvantage of TMOs is their 
low conductivity, which makes it difficult for them to achieve the high 
theoretical specific capacitance value. Many attempts have been made 
to create HCs, but they have always failed because of the limits of each 
material.3. Limitations of the metal oxide nanostructures 
Principally, the material with lower molar mass but higher number 
of electrons involved in the electron transfer possesses larger specific 
capacitance. Therefore, the important parameters for higher electrochemical performances are different constituents, oxidation state of the 
metal ions, and the composition of metal oxides in a composites or 
hybrid. Moreover, the electrochemically active specific surface area 
(SSA) at which the pseudocapacitance process occurs, plays a significant 
role in the whole process. The SSA of the nanostructure is determined 
from its rational design, microstructure, morphology and pore size. The 
overall design and the presence of mesoporous pores in the nanostructure contribute towards the higher electrochemical activity, 
enhancing the specific capacitance of the nanomaterial. 
Another concern for the metal oxide electrodes is larger band gap 
compared to metal resembling a semiconductor behavior. It results a 
poor electroconductivity which strictly restrict the electrochemical 
redox domain of the applied electrode materials. 
Thus, we have summarized the principal factors which influence the 
performance of the metal oxide based on electrodes based on constitution, microstructure, electroconductivity and electrolytes as discussed 
above. Eventually we will be discussing some of the recent breakthrough research works to involve the above topics and present some 
more research in order to develop metal oxide-based electrodes in the 
future. 
3.1. Diverse chemical composition 
Single component metal oxide does not meet the requirement of a 
comprehensive performance of a supercapacitor electrode. Therefore 
diverse chemical composition is examined by the researchers to fully 
meet the desired necessities [44]. For instance, Potphode et al., synthesized a multiwalled carbon nanotubes/Polyaniline composites electrode to demonstrate a redox active behavior of the diverse composition 
in supercapacitor application. The most specific capacitances of 186.1, 
809.6 and 644.4 F/g were achieved at 25 mV/s scan rate was displayed 
by the mechanically stable polymer gel electrolyte, which also had a 
long cycle life, high ionic conductivity, and great compatibility with the 
active material [45]. Zhang et al., developed an the self-assembled 
NiCo2O4/MnO2 and MoO3@PPy composites are used as positive and 
negative electrodes, respectively, in an aqueous asymmetric SC with a 
Na2SO4 electrolyte. The influence of the synergistic effect between the 
components, enhanced an energy density of 604 Wh/Kg and power 
density of 2400 Wh/kg. The asymmetric SC exhibited a cyclic life of 
>10,000 cycles [46]. 
Xiaoqi et al. fabricated 3D self-supporting Ti3C2 with MoS2 and Cu2O 
nanocrystal composite where Ti3C2 had MoS2 integrated into it, and 
two-dimensional nanosheets with Cu2O inside of them as shown in 
Fig. 2. 
MoS2 nanosheets were joined together and made more conducive to 
charge transfer by Ti3C2 and the lamellar structure of Ti3C2-MoS2 was 
successfully preserved by Cu2O. This composite was used for assembling 
of flexible SC which exhibited an outstanding specific capacitance of 
1459 F/g at 1 A/g current density. Besides this the 90 % capacitance 
retained even after 3000 cycles. [47] 
Metal oxides are attributed with the multiple valence states leaded to 
rise the electrochemical activity. The synergistic properties between 
multiple TMO species would rather improve the overall performances by 
assisting some of the activities as ion adsorption, diffusion, and mobility 
as comparable to single species. In addition to the variety of metal oxides, other compounds like hydroxides, metal quantum dots, and organics have also lately come into being. Further, the detailed discussion 
on some diverse leading-edge literatures are presented to fully understand the thoughtful design of the electrodes using the synergistic effects 
of multiple components. 
3.2. Microstructure and electroconductivity 
In comparison to the bulk structure, nanostructures with large surface to volume ration have widely evolved and celebrated its asset with 
its unique physical and chemical properties. Likewise the microstructure 
parameters deeply determine the TMO based electrode for electrochemical correspondences. Again, the specific surface area, diffusion of 
electrolytic ions and the quality of absorbing moisture with electrolytes 
influences the microstructure of the electrodes to a large extent. A large 
number of metal oxides exhibited different range of charge storage 
which is based on its acquired morphologies. For example, a 
morphology based study was conducted to form a NoCo2O4 (NCO) based 
electrode for asymmetric SCs. 
The spinel NiCo2O4 possessed some of the morphologies such as 
nanorods, nanoparticles, nanoflowers and 3D sphere assembled with 
nanoparticles. Amongst all the nanostructure, the 3D spherical microstructure persuaded a maximum specific capacitance of 225.07 F/g at 
0.5 A/g current density with an outstanding cyclic stability of 3000 
cycles [48]. 
Another work claimed by Wang et al., where a dual morphology of 
ZnCo2O4/N doped reduced graphene oxide /Ni foam substrate (ZNGN) 
was conducted for asymmetric supercapacitors. First the ZnCo2O4 sheet 
depicted a honeycomb structure which exhibited a specific capacitance 
of 1600F/g at 1A/g current density. Later the combined structure 
ZNGN/activated carbon (AC) showed an energy density as well as power 
density of 661 W h/kg and 701 W/kg respectively. The different morphologies of the obtained structure is shown Fig. 3 [49]. 
To obtain different morphologies with different dimensions and 
surface areas of a nanostructure needs several optimizations and hence it 
is a difficult and challenging task. Recently, a lot of reported literature 
on metal oxide framework (MOF) has accounted its capability to become 
a supreme material for SCs [51,52]. The morphology of Ni(OH)2@Co/C 
composite on MOF template is a rhombic dodecahedron decorated with 
Ni(OH)2 nanosheets as shown in Fig. 3 (g & h). This composite was 
studied for SC application. The Co particles and porous carbon improved 
the conductivity and cycle stability of Ni(OH)2 electrode materials 
respectively. Electrochemical performance demonstrated that sheet like 
Ni(OH)2 with large effective area has a superior charge storage performance of 952 F/g specific capacitance at the current density of 0.5 A/g

[50]. It does not provide the detailed synthesis, fundamental and applications of MOF derived supercapacitors in this review, since it is 
beyond our scope but are given in other special review where the main 
focuses are on the above mentioned area. 
Another issue on which TMOs are facing huge criticisms is their 
electrical conductivity. To be known, band gap determines the intrinsic 
conductivity of metal oxides based electrode material which is usually 
low compared to carbon based electrode of SCs [52]. Some of the 
methods which are used for enhancing the conductivity of the materials 
are doping of element, creation of oxygen vacancies, compositing, etc. 
Amongst all, the synthesis of composite nanostructure is a well-known 
and popular method. In relation, MXenes, have been developed as an 
important material due to their high metallic conductivity which 
compensated the drawback of low electroconductivity for supercapacitor electrode. A self-assembled nanocomposite of MXenes, 
(Ti3C2TX)/α-Fe2O3 electrodes reported a high specific capacitances of 
405.4 F/g at 2 A/g current density for Galvanostatic chargingdischarging (GCD) and 289 F/g at a minimum scan rate of 10 mV/s in 
cyclic voltammetry(CV). It attended a long stability of 2000 cycles at a 
constant scan rate of 100 mV/s with 97.7 % retention [53]. Along with 
this kind of work, there are some works where composites of MXenes are 
made with high conductive carbon based materials like CNT, graphene, 
etc. and polymers [54–56] . Some of the studies based on carbon and 
metal oxide based composites are recently well reported. Biomass 
derived carbon materials were supremely fit in this category due to its 
wide resources and recycle economy. A specific capacitance of 892 F/g 
was reached by a fabricated hierarchal structure of Co3O4@ carbon fiber 
derived from biomass [57]. 
Another advanced material which has developed as an innovative 
carbon material is graphdiyne. It is beneficial for the electrochemical 
application due to the electronic structure in consequence of high degree 
of p conjugation. The uniform distribution of pores allows the Li and Na 
ion to be stored. A FeCo2O4@polypyrrole with the structure of core-shell 
nanowires exhibited high specific capacitance of about 2269 F/g with 
long time stability was developed by Li and co-workers [58]. TMO 
especially in the case of tungsten oxide, the electronic properties are 
completely dependent over the stoichiometric factors i.e., creation of 
oxygen vacancy. The anticipated importance of oxygen vacancy in 
modulating the properties of a nanostructure is already reported in some 
literatures. The higher degrees of oxygen vacancy create semiconductormetallic properties [59]. The oxygen vacancy creation in tungsten oxide 
has an anisotropic nature in x- and y-direction which is beneficial in 
terms of anisotropic electronic properties. W18O49 has been largely 
considered for the energy storage and electrochemical glucose sensing 
application as it carries the largest degree of oxygen deficiency in WO3. 
Not only electrical conductivity but also electrochemical performance of 
MnO2 nanowires by increasing the kinetics of redox reaction were 
intrinsically improved by inducing oxygen vacancy [60–62] . Tong et al. 
has reported concerning to the synthesis of oxygen deficient MnO2 
(MnO2-x) by hydrogenation method and has realized the enhancement in 
the electrochemical performance by the action of increasing conductivity. Jain et al. has reported that the MgO nanostructure has a very 
wide band gap of 3.44 eV which restricts its electronics application. 
Further by the creation of oxygen vacancies in MgO shows a photoluminescence (PL) emission in the blue region which opens up its electronics applications by reducing the band gap [63]. Therefore, the 
introduction of defects in crystal materials is found to alter and affect the 
electronic structure by modifying the physical and chemical 
characteristics. 
3.3. Different types of electrolytes 
The performance of SCs depends critically on electrolytes as well. 
The electrolyte used in the SC is the combination of salt and solvent. It is 
another important part of the ES, which generate ionic conductivity as 
well as charge compensation across the electrode in an electrochemical 
cell. The following factors should be taken into consideration when 
choosing an electrolyte: (a) the size and type of the ions, (b) the electrode materials, (c) the concentration of ions and solvent, (d) the 
interaction of ions and solvent, and (e) the potential window of the 
device. Majorly there are two types of electrolyte: 
3.3.1. Aqueous and organic electrolytes 
Aqueous electrolyte once more be categorised into three categories: 
(i) acidic solutions e.g. H2SO4, (ii) alkaline solutions like KOH, NaOH and 
(iii) neutral solutions like Li2SO4 and Na2SO4. The aqueous electrolytes 
own not only a greater capacitance but also rate performance due to the 
relative higher ionic conductivity and low solution resistance [63]. It is 
very limited in use for large scale application because of the decomposition of water, narrow potential window, and limited energy density in 
SCs. Still it is useful for some purposes, as it is cheap in nature and where 
energy density can be compromised over the cost. 
Organic electrolytes express a contradictory behavior in comparison 
to aqueous electrolyte as it reveals a wider potential window and

subsequently larger energy and power density. This electrolyte is quite 
expensive due to the filtration and purification from water. Also the 
solvent used for the organic electrolytes, acetonitrile (ACN), and propylene are flammable which is dangerous and can’t be preferred 
regarding safety issues. Recently, a “water-in-salt” (WIS) concept is 
chosen to elaborate the solution of short potential window of aqueous 
electrolyte and flammability issue. Wang et al. selected a highly 
concentrated “water-in salt” LiTFSI electrolyte for providing a larger 
potential window. The system provided an extra cathodic potential of 
1.9 V and anodic potential of 4.9 V vs Li+/Li, respectively [64]. Ma et al. 
recently developed a (VOx) VN nanowires on the carbon cloth (VNNW@CC) stabilized in a wider voltage range of − 1.4 V – 0.7 V in “water 
in salt” aqueous electrolyte. Fig. 4(a & b) shows the SEM images of the 
VOx-NWs@CC and (c) shows the as synthesized VN-NWs@CC annealed 
for 6 in ammonia environment. 
Fig. 4 shows the electrochemical performance of the VN-NWs@CC 
for SC application in a wide potential window. Fig. 4(d) shows the CV 
profiles of the VN-NWs@CC at different scan rates. The CV curve at 2 
mV/s scan rate demonstrates a capacitive behavior whereas it shows a 
battery-like behavior at scan rate of 200 mV/s. Fig. 4(e) depicts the GCD 
plots of the material at various current densities in potential window 
− 1.4 to 0.7 V. The plot of specific capacity vs current density is shown in 
Fig. 4(f) which reveals that in comparison to the values found for 1 M 
aqueous KOH electrolyte, the rate capacity of the VN-NWs@CC electrode in 21 m (mol/kg) lithium bis(trifluoromethane sulfonyl)imide 
(LiTFSI) aqueous electrolyte is poor. Fig. 4 (g & h) presents the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Fig. 4(i) shows the b value 
for the VN-NWs@CC electrode in 21 m LITFSI electrolyte, the cathodic 
and anodic peaks are roughly 0.6 and 0.4, respectively depicting that the 
diffusion process have an impact on the charge storage. This can imply 
the slow reaction of hydrogen evolution reaction and redox reaction at a 
low potential [65]. 
3.3.2. Ionic liquid (IL) electrolytes 
Both aqueous and organic electrolytes do not work well with high 
temperatures above 70 ◦C and 80 ◦C. IL electrolytes works well even at 
high temperatures due to its high thermal and chemical stabilities. It has 
a very high potential window, negligible vapor pressure and inflammable properties. The commonly used IL electrolyte is 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate (EMIMAc). ILs known as room-temperature molten 
salts that are liquids without solvents and at ambient temperature, made 
up of only ions. They are considered as the third kind of electrolytes

amongst the three categories of electrolytes. Moreover, low flammability, a working potential window, low toxicity as well as high thermal 
and chemical stability that extends to 6 V are all characteristics of ILs. 
3.3.2.1. Binders, separators and current collectors. The binder, separator 
and current collectors also crucially contribute to SCs’ successful performance. Binders provides the necessary binding between the molecules of the electrolyte in the SC. The choice of binder is so selected that 
it can effectively bind the molecules in the electrolyte and easily release 
during the ion separation. There are several binders reported so far for 
the effective performance in SCs. There has been report of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) binder as the most adopted one for SC application 
as shown in Table 1. Unlike binders there are many current collectors 
such as Ni foam, sulfonated graphene, Cu foil, etc. have been found to 
provide the necessary utilization. From the Table 1, it can be seen that 
most of the works are reported with Ni foam current collector owing to 
its porous nature and abundance. Separators have the significant role to 
separate the electrodes of the SC and restrict it from getting shortcircuited. The selection of separator is so done that, it should have a 
porous nature and easily allow the ions to pass through it without the 
structural degradation. There are many separators have been reported 
for SC applications as summarized in Table 1. 
4. Synthesis methods to obtain TMOs 
The synthesis of TMO nanomaterial has been performed utilizing 
several synthetic methods, including hydrothermal/solvothermal, microwave aided, electrodeposition, co-precipitation, sonochemical, and 
others. The recent study of the hydrothermal/solvothermal synthesis 
process has led to its recognition as one of the most straightforward, 
simple, and environmentally friendly methods for producing mixed 
transition metal oxides [72–73]. Using a simple hydrothermal method 
with template-free and NH4(OH) as the alkaline medium, Kumar et al. 
synthesized 3D porous urchin-shaped Ni3V2O8 hollow nanospheres 
electrodes. The electrode, as synthesized, had a promising specific capacity of 402.8C/g at a current density of 1 A/g, improved rate performance, and outstanding cyclic stability (88 % capacity retention) over 
1000 cycles [74]. Additionally, Wang et al. demonstrated a simple hydrothermal method that successfully generated radially growing 
NiMoO4 nanowires on carbon cloth[75] 
In order to create micro- and nano-sized composite materials, the 
microwave assisted approach provides an easy and quick synthetic 
process. Since the synthesis technique is highly depending on the temperature of the reaction, the microwave assisted technology in particular 
has the remarkable capacity controlled heating that promotes the 
development of nanomaterial [76]. For the synthesis of several metal 
oxides in a single pot and bimetallic oxide nanostructured materials. 
Recently, the microwave-assisted method has become very popular in 
both business and academics [77,78]. However, with a microwave aided 
technique, controlling the TMO’s phases and form is challenging [73]. 
Because it is inexpensive and simple of manipulation, the sol-gel 
technique has garnered significant interest in the synthesis of TMO. 
Additionally, using this method results in a product with a high degree 
of homogeneity and purity. [76] Liu et al. reported the sol-gel technique 
to fabricate a mesoporous NiO/NiCo2O4/Co3O4 composite. The 
composite showed outstanding rate capability, cyclic stability, and superior specific capacitance of 1717 F/g, with capacity retention of 94.9 
% after 1000 cycles. [79] However, the practical application of the solgel technology on a huge scale synthesis of TMO is still quite difficult 
because so many chemicals and organic solvents are used in the process. 
The synthesis of TMO as an electrode material for SC usage involves 
the one-step, simple process of electrodeposition. Electrochemical redox 
reactions are the basis for the electrodeposition process, and when a 
metal salt solution is subjected to an electric current, the metal is 
deposited on the electrode. Even though electrodeposition is helpful for 
producing TMO with consistent shape, its inability to scale remains a 
significant barrier to its use in real-world applications. [76] 
Another easy and popular method for producing micro/nanoscale 
materials, like TMO, on a large scale for use in energy storage systems 
and catalytic processes is chemical precipitation. This method has been 
used extensively to date in the fabrication of the TMO for SC applications. At various calcination temperatures (400–500 ◦C), Wu et al. 
created a mesoporous Ni0.3Co2.7O4 electrode with a hierarchical structure for SC application. At calcination temperatures of 400, 450, and 
550 ◦C, respectively, the as-synthesized Ni0.2Co2.7O4 gave high specific 
capacitance of 960, 834, and 713 F/g at current density of 0.625 A/g. 
[80] Although this process have several advantages for synthesizing 
TMO, its practical application is still hampered by the challenges of 
influencing the morphology of as-synthesized TMO. 
MOF has recently received a great deal of attention as a template or 
precursor for the synthesis of TMO with porous topologies as a potential 
choice for supercapacitor applications [81]. The MOF precursors, such 
as NiO, ZnO, TiO2, Mn2O3, CuCo2O4, NiCo2O4, ZnCo2O4, and others, 
have so far been used to synthesis a variety of transition metal oxides 
and TMOs [82,83]. Although, the TMO produced from MOFs has a 
remarkable specific capacitance, its practical uses as supercapacitor 
electrodes have been limited by weak electrical conductivity and inadequate cycling stability. 
In summary, by adjusting the reaction temperature, auxiliary concentration, and pH, the hydrothermal/solvothermal technique can 
change the shape of the nanocomposite. On the other hand, a variety of 
conductive matrix, including nickel foam and carbon matrix, can be 
added to the electrodeposition method using TMO, which produces an 
exciting synergistic effect can be achieved by changing process factors 
like pH and solution concentration. The hydrolysis, polymerization, 
gelation, condensation, drying, and densification procedures are associated with chemical and physical processes in the sol-gel process. 
Additionally, the electrodeposition process used to create TMO is largely 
dependent on electrochemical redox processes. When a current of 
electricity passes through a solution of metal salts, metal is deposited on 
the electrode. Additionally, chemical precipitation enables the synthesis 
of TMO under benign reaction circumstances. Finally, dependent on how 
the organic and inorganic elements within the crystal structure are 
synthesized, MOF can be used to fabricate nanocomposite materials in 
one (1D), two (2D), and three (3D) dimensions with large specific surfaces and porous structures.

5. Different types of hybrid metal oxide electrodes for 
supercapacitors 
In general, SCs are energy storage systems that have great long cyclic 
stability, quick charge/discharge, and high power density. Hence, SCs 
have acquired the tremendous interest from scientific community for 
energy conversions and storage. An explanation of various SCs based on 
hybrid metal oxide electrodes can be found in the following sections. 
Distinctive merits of their electrochemical characteristics make them 
growing prominent in SCs as well as other energy industries. Futureoriented and cutting-edge supercapacitor technology is thoroughly 
covered in this section. 
5.1. Manganese oxides based hybrid nanostructures 
Manganese oxide was first ever applied for energy storage alkaline 
battery cell application in 1860s. Manganese oxides and its derivative 
oxides have been considerably accepted in the field of energy storage 
because of its commendatory belongings, for instance, multiple easy and 
cheap synthesis techniques (hydrothermal, electrochemical, etc), abundance, harmless as less toxic, non-expensive [84–87]. In a previous 
literature, ZnCo2O4/MnO2 hybrid nanomaterial with nanocone 
morphology arrays pursuing a high surface area and a mesoporous coreshell structure was directly deposited over nickel foam via hydrothermal 
synthesis [88]. The structure comprised of two important components 
(i) ZnCo2O4 as core and (ii) MnO2 as shell. The impressive electrochemical performance of rate capability and stability of the electrode 
could be analyzed as synergistic effect between the two species MnO2 
and ZnCo2O4. The synergistic effect can be explained by some of the 
explanations noted below: 
(i) Due to the incorporation of Ni foam as a current collector and a 
binder-free direct deposition, the conductivity factor of the 
overall hybrid components have increased on a larger scale and

completely refuses the need of an conductive additives and 
binding agent like polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) which generally reduces the conductivity with a larger value [89]. 
(ii) The direct synthetic deposition of the active material on the 
substrate enhances the adherence and reduces the intrinsic 
resistance of the core-shell structure. The core material is pure 
crystalline which intensify the electron transport [90]. 
(iii) The direct and well separated growth of ZnCo2O4 supplements 
more number of active sites and individually both the core and 
shell can well interact with the potassium ions effectively [91]. 
The hybrid core-shell structure expressed a specific capacitance of 
2339 F/g and 1526 F/g at a minimum current density of 1 A/g and 
maximum current density 10 A/g, respectively. 
Another work carried out recently by Yuan et al. in which a 3D 
scaffold template was used for tuning the microstructure of a hybrid 
electrode. The green synthesis process was established for developing 
the 3D porous carbon scaffold-MnO2 (3D-HPCS@MnO2) nanohybrid 
electrode for the SC application. The outcome morphology was a colony 
like structure. The 3D scaffold template manifested the conversion of the 
oxidation state from Mn2+ to Mn4+ by controlling the growth of electrodeposited MnO2. Fig. 6 reveals the electrochemical property of the 
asymmetric electrode supercapacitor (ASC) in Na2SO4 electrolyte based 
on Ni-HPCS as a anode and Ni-HPCS-MnO2 as cathode (Fig. 5(a)). The 
ASC displayed a wide potential window of − 1 to 1.0 V without any 
alteration in the CV curve. Also the CV was carried out at two different 
operating potentials as shown in Fig. 5(b). The CV and GCD measured at 
different scan rates and current densities respectively are shown in Fig. 5 
(c & d). Additionally, the low values of series resistance Re and charge 
transfer resistance Rct are obtained from the EIS spectra shown in Fig. 5 
(e). The specific gravimetric specific capacitance obtained from the GCD 
was 217.3 F/g at 2 A/g and decreased to 113.8 F/g at 15 A/g current 
density (Fig. 5 f). Finally, ASC also demonstrated the 82.1 % capacity 
retention over 4000 cycles at 15 A/g (Fig. 5 g). The Fig. 5 (h) shows the 
Ragone plots of 3D-HPCS@MnO2 in various aqueous electrolytes for 
comparison study. The GCD curve is showing a pseudocapacitor 
behavior which is justified by the presence of a pair of cathodic and 
anodic humps for the redox nature. The schematics shown in Fig. 5(i) 
showed mechanism for the high performance electrochemical actions. It 
is manifested that the ASC is behaving as a natural template with a very 
high surface area. The forest like pores on the template acts as rich sites 
to absorb dopants. The colony like morphology control the deposition of 
MnO2 and the overall hybrid electrode improves the diffusion of electron and ions at the interface. 
The material had an advantage of exceptionally large specific surface 
area of 1627 m2
/g depicting large gravimetric specific capacitance of 
1627 F/g and high stability upto 10,000 cycles [66]. 
Tian et al. developed a MnO2 based hybrid material electrode for SC 
application. The core shell hybrid nanostructure was obtained by a twostep hydrothermal method on Ni Foam. The morphology of the structure

was a hierarchical architecture of flakes of Ni(OH)2 on MnO2 nanosheets 
symbolizes Ni(OH)2/MnO2 HHA. The MnO2 nanosheets exhibited a 
highly porous structure having large surface area providing a proper 
surface for the electrolyte-electrode interaction. The binder free electrode exhibited an advantage of high conductivity. A specific capacity of 
253.6 mAh/g was achieved at a high current density of 2A/g which was 
more in comparison to the individual species MnO2 and Ni(OH)2. Device 
testing was also conducted as shown in the Fig. 6(a), where the HC was 
designed in an asymmetric form by assembling the hybrid electrode as a 
cathode and active carbon as an anode. The Fig. 6(b) confirms the EDLC 
behavior of the AC within − 1 to 0 V and Ni(OH)2/MnO2 HHA shows 
charge-discharge peaks within potential range of − 1.0 to 0.9 V. Fig. 6(c 
& d) shows CV and GCD curves at various scan rates and current densities respectively. The electrochemical performance of the ASC depicted 
in the Ragone plot in Fig. 6(e) with a maximum cycle in the wide voltage 
range of 0–1.9 V. The highest specific energy was calculated as 29.9 Wh/ 
kg at 1900 W /kg. The stability test shows only 8.7 % deterioration in 
specific capacity over 5000 cycles as given in Fig. 6(f). The uniform 2D 
branched hierarchical structure also retained even after 5000 cycles as 
shown in the inset resulting in outstanding cyclic stability. Fig. 6(g & h) 
confirms the HRTEM image of the core shell nanostructure of Ni(OH)2 
and MnO2. The high performance can be established due to the 2D 
branched hybrid nanostructure with high surface area, mesoporous 
nature and synergistic effect of both Ni(OH)2 and MnO2 [67]. 
From the above discussed literature it is noted that the hybrid 
nanostructure’s essential and vital role is in providing a synergistic effect of the two different dimensions of different structured nanomaterials contributed in a superior charge storage capacity. Hierarchical 
structures are often known to be effective in achieving the conversion, 
adsorption-desorption, and redox reactions linked to electrochemical 
applications (HHA). Above all, further discussed literature displayed a 
promising method to design and fabricate the flexible SCs. 
MOF and MnO2 based ternary hybrid composites for energy storage 
application was investigated by Li et al. where the ultimate motive is to 
enhance the conductivity of the MOF derivative. Fig. 7 shows a HRTEM 
images of the binder free Ni(OH)2-MnO2@C grown on Ni foam confirming the formation of a nanosheets. The Lattice fringes shows the dspacing of both the nanomaterial Ni(OH)2 corresponds to (100) & (101),

MnO2 corresponds to (311) & (400) planes. The nanosheets displayed a 
substantial surface area of 204.1m2

MnO2@C as cathode and activated carbon as anode. 
Fig. 8(b) shows the CV profiles of Ni(OH)2-MnO2@C and AC electrodes in a 1 M KOH electrolyte. Fig. 8(c) depicts the CV profiles of Ni 
(OH)2-MnO2@C at various scan rates demonstrating the higher rate 
capability of HSC device. The GCD curves of HSC device in Fig. 8(d) 
tested at different current densities from 0.28 to 2.8 A/g indicating all 
curves have good symmetry resulting in balanced charge storage of HSC 
devices. The device demonstrated an energy density and power density 
of about 39.1 Wh/kg and 221.4 W/kg respectively (Fig. 8e). Additionally, the HSC device exhibited good cyclic stability over 5000 cycles 
with 85.2 % specific capacitance retention at 40 mA/cm2 as shown in 
Fig. 8(f). The advantages which have been extracted from the hybrid 
nanostructure are the (i) hierarchical nanostructure (ii) large surface 
area (iii) efficient electron and ion transport channel, (iv) redox active 
sites (v) excellent electrical conductivity (vi) good adhesion due to the 
direct deposition of nanostructure over Ni foam. [68]

5.2. Cobalt oxide hybrid nanostructures 
Cobalt oxides are considered to be an alternative choice for SC 
electrodes. It has many advantages like low cost, less toxic, and high 
theoretical specific capacitance. During electrochemical reaction, this 
particular nanomaterial exhibits both kind of mechanism, the 
capacitance is produced by both battery-like behavior (Co3O4 + OH- +
H2O 3MOOH + e-) and pseudocapacitive activity (CoOOH + OH- CoO2 
+ H2O + e-). The improved electrochemical reaction could happen 
because of the fast ion mobility, electronic transportation [93,94]. 
In a work, conducted by Shekhar et al. Co3O4-NiO fish thorns like 
structure together with NiO nanosheets arrays formed a core-shell

structure core-shell nanostructures which were synthesized utilizing a 
hydrothermal process where the morphologies obtained were groomed 
by the action of ammonium fluoride (NH4F). As shown in Fig. 9, the 
assembling of device in done where the NiO nanosheets arrays (NiO 
NSAs) acts as a cathode electrode of the device. Subsequently the coreshell hybrid structure depicted a high surface area and a high porous 
path for the movement and interaction of electrolyte ions to the electrode. The areal capacity obtained from the nanomaterial was 313.9 μA 
h/cm2 at a current density of 4 mA/cm2
. Furthermore, a pouch type 
hybrid SC device was fabricated which provided an area capacitance of 
623.5 mF/cm2 at 2 mA/cm2 current density. Ragone plot shows a 
maximum energy density of 216.1 μW h/cm2 and power density of 27.7 
mW/cm2
. The device also demonstrates a stability of 5000 cycles with a 
capacitive retention of 126 %. Later the SC device was examined for 
lighting the light emitting diode (LED) and a toy motor fan for investigating the real practical application. Here some of the reason for the 
advanced electrochemical applications is the synergistic effect between 
the NiO NSAs@Co3O4-NiO and porous activated carbon electrode which 
provides a high conductivity, porous active sites, high surface area for 
the large number of redox reactions and less expensive material for the 
device fabrication [92]. A hybrid nanowire was synthesized using hydrothermal method by Wang et al. Furthermore, a carbon layer was 
deposited over the nanowires and then annealed at a lower temperature 
by chemical vapor deposition route. The components of the hybrid 
electrode were CoO and carbon. It exhibited a high stability of 10,000 
cycles with a capacitive retention of 96.9 %. CoO/C acted as a cathode 
and activated carbon as an anode for a ASC, which exhibited an energy 
density of about 58.9 W h/kg [71]. 
The two important and required parameters for the charge storage of 
energy storage devices are redox reactions and electron mobility. The 
one way which can satisfy these two needs is the augmentation of two or 
more different nanostructures which can assume to compensate the 
drawback of each other and strengthen one another. To investigate on 
these two issues, a work done by Chang et al. by compositing two battery 
qualified nanostructure electrode Co3O4 and Ni3S4 to form a heterostructure composite for SC application. First, through hydrothermal 
reaction of Co salt, followed by pyrolysis and sulfidation etching of Ni 
Foam. 
The heterostructure was formed by the coating of Ni3S4 sheets over 
the Co3O4 nanowire arrays. The multi-dimensional hybrid 
nanostructure created a porous network which facilitates the movement 
of electrolyte ions over the surface. Also the porosity enhances surfaces 
for the active sites and the expected redox activity in the cell. As shown 
in the Fig. 10, the heterostructure results an areal capacitance of 246C/ 
cm2 at a minimum current density of 1 mA/cm2
. Furthermore it is 
suitable for the practical applications as the material depicted a very 
high stability upto 5000 charging-discharging cycles with 91 % capacity 
retention. Again after investigating the suitability of the material for 
energy storage devices, the electrode was demonstrated for the device 
testing. In the device testing of the electrode, the material exhibited a 
high areal capacitance with slow self-discharge behavior. The synergy of 
the faradaic Co3O4 and NiS4 with different orientations was expected to 
be kind towards superior charge storage. The good stability of the device 
was dedicated to the robust longevity of the heterostructure hybrid 
material. The wider potential window for the electrochemical test in CV 
stimulates the area of the curve, which dramatically enhances the Ccell 
due to the redox reaction occurred at higher partial potential [95]. 
Considering the advantages of composite and hybrid nanostructure, Yu 
et al. developed a unique morphology of novel blanket like Co(OH)2/ 
CoOOH/Co3O4/Cu(OH)2 abbreviated as “CV” on copper foam. This 
large combination of material was synthesized by an easy solution 
dependent hydrothermal method. It is called as blanket like structure 
due to its conversion from flat spongy sheet like precursor to a combination of many nanowires as shown in Fig. 11(f & g). The composite has 
gained a surface area of 228.4 m2
/g, which is one order larger than the 
precursor’s surface area. There are two types of electrode used for the 
study. (i) non heated, CV sample electrode, (ii) heated sample electrode 
are given in Fig. 11 (a & b) Initially the material was electrochemically 
investigated by CV and GCD in a 3-electrode system. The occurrence of 
the redox feature as shown in Fig. 11 (c) corresponds to the pseudocapacitive behavior of the nanostructure. The charging–discharging is 
showing a pseudocapacitor behavior by exhibiting a IR drop followed by 
a plateau region (Fig. 11 d). The material as an electrode is giving a 
specific capacity of 290.8 μAh/cm2 at 1 mA/cm2 with a stability upto 
10,000 cycles as depicted in Fig. 11(e). The stable nature of the electrode 
in the electrolyte is an important and necessary parameter for the 
development of device. In comparison to the heated sample electrode, 
CV sample electrode depicted more surface area in CV experiment which 
would definitely acquire large specific capacity. The reason for the 
higher capacity of CV sample’s electrochemical performance would be

the presence of more number of Co(OH)2 molecules. Co(OH)2 molecules 
favored the ion and electron transport in the material. Later, as shown in 
Fig. 11, the ASC device was fabricated and electrochemically characterized by taking CV sample as a cathode and heated carbon cloth as 
anode. The assembled device showed an areal capacity of 245.1 μW h/ 
cm2 at 2 mA/cm2
. The energy density was calculated from the areal 
capacity and it was 196.1 μW h/cm2
. In this case again the direct growth 
of nanostructure urged a need of binder free electrode where the conductivity needs not to be compromised [96]. 
Recently, Cu2O@Co3O4/PC composite used for SC application. 
Fig. 12 (a) shows the GCD profile for the Cu2O@Co3O4/PC composite 
and porous carbon (PC) measured at 1A/g. The EIS spectra for both are 
given in Fig. 12 (b) and Fig. 12 (c) depicts the CV profiles for the 
Cu2O@Co3O4/PC composite recorded at various scan rates. The specific 
capacitance of the Cu2O@Co3O4/PC composite electrode is 1096 F/g at 
current density of 1 A/g (Fig. 12 d & e). Fig. 12 (f) shows that the 83 % 
capacitance is retained over 3000 cycles. [97] In conclusion, the cobalt 
oxide based materials are useful for SC applications. [98] 
5.3. Nickel oxide hybrid nanostructure 
Nickel oxide and its derivative, Ni2O3, NiO2, NiO are widely accepted 
and recognized for energy storage application. It is present in several 
crystalline forms like cubic, hexagonal, monoclinic etc [99]. NiO is 
highly considered since it has high theoretical capacitance of 2573 F/g 
[100]. Nowadays, a spinel type Ni–Co oxide has gained a lot of attention of researcher. [101–103] 
Hao et al. used a ternary composite of polyaniline, nickel oxide and 
sulfonated graphene ASC. Sulfonated graphene (SG) acted as a substrate 
where a uniform dispersed nickel oxide (NiO and polyaniline (PANI) 
occurred. The process used for the growth of the nanomaterial over the 
substrate was hydrothermal and chemical oxidative polymerization was 
used for the growth of PANI nanostructure. The material showed a 
specific capacitance of 1350 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g and 
maintained stability over 5000 cycles with a capacitive retention of 
92.23 %. Furthermore as shown in Fig. 13, an ASC device was fabricated 
with PANI/NiO/SGO as cathode and activated carbon (AC) as an anode. 
The device fortified a specific capacity of 308.8 F/g. Ragone plot showed 
that the device demonstrated a high energy density of 109.8 Wh/kg and 
a power density of 0.8 kW/kg. The most crucial component for the 
actual industrial use is the stability test manifested a stability of the ASC 
device by being stable till 10,000 cycles. The practical uses of the ternary 
composite were verified by lighting a green LED after connecting two 
SCs together in series. [69]. 
Typically, MOF nanosheets have received many researchers attention for developing MOF dependent energy storage devices. The material is investigated on a large scale due to its adaptable pore size, large 
surface area, and outstanding stability. These advantages inspired Lin 
et al. to probe the material for supercapacitor electrode. But the MOF 
lacks in terms of poor conductivity and slow ion movement. 
In consequences of the drawbacks the material is combined with the 
NiO nanoparticles. Fig. 14(a & b) shows the SEM images of fabricated 
nanostructure and from the characterization, the materials as 2D CuTCPP (tetrakis (4-carboxyphenyl) phosphonium porphyrin) MOF 
nanosheets and NiO particles is confirmed. 
Fig. 14 (c & d) depicts the CV curves of the NiO/Cu-TCPP/GCE at 
various scan rates indicating the Faraday process. The GCD profile at a 
current density of 5 A/g, of NiO/Cu-TCPP/GCE (a), NiO/GCE (b), and 
CuTCPP/GCE (c) are shown in Fig. 14 (e & f). This finding suggests that 
the charge and discharge curves of changed electrodes are nonlinear. 
[104]. The electrochemical properties of the hybrid material were 
further compared with MOF and NiO nanoparticles individually. The 
electrochemical characterization revealed the specific capacitance of 
2394 F/g at 5 A/g current density. A nanoarrays of Nickel copper oxide 
were synthesized by an easy established process. Nickel copper oxide 
nanowire arrays were synthesized by an easy and simple process [105]. 
Again, recently a two-step hydrothermal method followed by microwave assisted method was used for synthesizing a core-shell nanostructure of NiO nanowires @NiO nanosheets at nickel foam. 
Hydrothermal synthesis was used for the growth of core material and 
microwave method for the shell. The measurement was conducted in 3M 
KOH electrolyte and it was found that the material showed a specific

capacitance of 1782 F/g at 1 A/g current density and stability till 7000 
GCD cycles. Additionally, a devices test was conducted for the synthesized core-shell nanomaterial NiO nanowires @NiO nanosheets @Nickel 
foam(NF)// Activated carbon coated NF(AC@NF) in Fig. 15 and found 
that ASC exhibited an energy density of 39.18 Wh /kg and power density 
of 12.24 kW/kg. The extraordinary electrochemical performances were 
contributed by the synergy between the nanowires and nanosheets 
[106]. 
5.4. Other transition metal oxides (TMOs) 
Other TMOs, like tungsten oxides, have shared oxygen atoms at the 
corners that form a WO6 octahedron. Both stoichiometric WO2 and WO3 
and non-stoichiometric WOx (2 < x < 3) can be used to construct them.

The most efficient method for adjusting the characteristics of functional 
TMOs is defect engineering. This strategy has been extensively acquired 
to get the enhanced physicochemical characteristics in areas such as 
catalysis, energy storage, and sensors [107]. It is outlined in certain 
research work that adding oxygen vacancies to metal oxides may 
improve the material’s catalytic capabilities [108,109]. Usually, sites of 
oxygen vacancies on the surfaces of metal oxides are most effective as 
they contribute towards the improvement of surface redox reactions 
leading to the enhancement of electrochemical performances [110,111]. 
Adjusting the oxygen shortage in bismuth iodide oxide (BiOI) nanosheets previously indicated enhanced photocatalytic activity, according 
to various studies like Huang et al., 10 times higher as compared to 
Fig. 14. SEM images of Cu-TCPP (a) and NiO/Cu-TCPP (b). EDX analysis of NiO/Cu-TCPP, (c) CV curves of the NiO/Cu-TCPP/GCE(red), Cu-TCPP/GCE (blue) and

untreated BiOI [112]. Zhai et al. synthesized MnO2 and concluded that 
tremendous improvement was seen in the SC performance due to the 
oxygen vacancy caused in the crystal structure [112]. Xu et al. has reported an effective approach for creating oxygen vacancy inside the 
porous copper oxide for the improved electrocatalytic properties [113]. 
In addition to the mentioned works about the significance of oxygen 
vacancies, the precise mechanics of their utilization remain an open 
question. These studies have also emphasized the electrochemical nature of defect-prone nanostructures, which has increased interest in 
determining how well-suited these nanostructures are for electrochemical applications such as glucose sensing and SCs. 
According to reports, tungsten-based suboxide nanostructures are a 
potential semiconductor material for a variety of uses, including field 
emission performance, electrochromic, photovoltaic, photocatalytic, 
and sensing (ideal band gap of 3.47 eV) [114–116]. W18O49, one of 
many non-stoichiometric tungsten oxides, has received extensive study 
and characterization because of its advantageous defect structure and 
innovative mixed valency features that produce exceptional physical 
and chemical properties in the nanoscale range. Due to the mixed 
valence tungsten ions by heat insulating, it is utilized to trap energy. 
Since it is having highest oxygen deficiency and stability, it is promising 
material for various applications. The diffusion-controlled redox reactions occurring at material surfaces allow for the detection of stability 
and electrochemical activity [117]. Surface oxygen vacancy on the 
surface of metal oxide results in strong anchoring as well as high 
dispersion of nanoparticles. The improvement in the intrinsic conductivity and electrochemical performance of TMOs has been carried out by 
creating the oxygen vacancies following the change in electronic 
structures [118,119]. It serves as donors in the metal oxides’ electronic 
structure, improving both donor density and electrical conductivity.

RuO2 nanostructures exhibits excellent properties such as high 
theoretical capacitance (1300–2200 F/g) and conductivity (105 S/cm). 
Another most advantageous property of RuO2 in acidic medium which 
results in remarkable electrochemical performance such as chemical 
stability and hence, extensively studied across globe [120,121]. Even 
though it has several captivating properties, still this material inaccessible for industrial applications due to demerits like agglomeration, low 
intrinsic resistance, weak conductivity in the nanoregime which makes 
it incapable in respect of the practical specific capacitance [122]. Since 
this material is expensive due to low abundance, the focus of research 
has been shifted towards the combining RuO2 with other nanomaterials 
is anticipated to increase the beneficial qualities. The impact of 
combining RuO2 with carbon-based materials, such as activated carbon 
[123], graphene [121], carbon nanotubes [124] and carbon aero gels 
[125], etc. are reported. Deng et al. reported the electrochemical result of 
RuO2/graphene hybrid material which showed the specific capacitance 
of 479 F/g [126]. Using the sol-gel method once more, Amir et al. 
created RuO2/rGO and attained a specific capacitance of 509 F/g. [127] 
Zheng et al. has attained a specific capacitance of 768 F/g from the 
amorphous RuO2. It is known from a variety of RuO2 literatures that 
amorphous RuO2 is essential for the development of SC electrodes with 
high energy and power densities [128,129]. The comparison of TMObased composites for SC application are summarized in Table 2. 
From Table 2, it can be observed that the MnO2/C synthesized by 
Kong et al. shows the capacitance of 258 F/g at 1 A/g [70], however by 
synthesizing the PANI/MnO2/FC the capacitance value increased to 289 
F/g at 5 A/g [130] which indicates the formation of composite helps to 
provide the better electrochemical performance in terms of capacitance. 
Similarly, hexagonal nanosheets of Ni(OH)2–MnO2@C synthesized by Li 
et al. exhibits an capacitance of 965.1 F/g at 2 mA/cm2 indicating the 
structural morphology also have the potential significance to enhance 
the capacitance value with high cycling stability of 93.3 % even at 5000 
cycles of the electrode [68]. The same electrode material named Ni 
(OH)2@NiCo2O4 composite synthesized by Huang et al. shows advanced 
electrochemical performance over the electrode synthesized by Li et al. 
[68]. This composite material demonstrated the capacitance of 3250 F/g 
at 1.25 A/g and also possessed good cycling stability of 80 % over 1000 
cycles [137]. This reveals that the formation of nanocomposites can 
even improve the electrode’s electrochemical efficiency and eventually 
of the overall capacitance. "
232_intro.txt.txt,"Nowadays, energy storage devices are essential due to the increase in 
the use of renewable sources of energy and the resulting demands on the 
grid infrastructure. In order to address these critical issues, cost-effective 
and environmentally friendly materials for energy storage devices, with 
high energy density, long life cycle, long shelf life, and fast chargedischarge, are required. The most commonly utilized energy storage 
devices include batteries, supercapacitors (SCs), and hybrid devices 
[1–6]. So far, SCs have been reported to exhibit low energy density and 
low capacitance values which limits their use in a wide range of 
emerging applications [7,8]. In order to overcome these limitations and 
increase the capacity of SCs, suitable materials need to be developed. A 
group of carbon based materials and transition metal oxides/hydroxides 
represents a potential option. Carbon based materials demonstrate 
electrochemical double layer capacitance (EDLC) behavior and transition 
metal oxides/hydroxides exhibit charge accumulation through pseudocapacitance (PC). Recently, research on perovskite materials has become 
very attractive due to the resulting increase in energy density and life 
expectancy caused by higher operating potential window. 
The main drawback of SCs can be attributed to its low surface area. 
Higher capacity in SCs can be accomplished by utilizing ion intercalation mechanism in bulk electrode for energy storage. Maximum 
intercalation-type SC electrodes have been reported in the literature in 
which positive ions act as the charge carriers [9,10]; anions are not of 
concern due to their large ion size. The perovskites materials, SrCoO3− δ 
(SCO) [11], Sr6Co5O15 [12], and SrCoO2.5 [13], with hexagonal or 
orthorhombic structure, are excellent candidates as cathode material for 
high performance SCs. These SCs can be utilized in IntermediateTemperature (IT)-Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) applications [14,15]. 
Besides, SCN is limited by the thermal stability of its crystal structure; it 
exhibits transformation into a 3C-type cubic structure (T > 950 ◦C)"
233_intro.txt.txt,"INTRODUCTION
The proportionately rising population and quickly
diminishing fossil fuels have allowed energy storage devices
(ESDs) to become a popular alternative.1,2 This rapidly
evolving energy storage market is driven by the robust
advancement of energy storage technologies. Batteries and
capacitors are two well-known ESDs, currently available in
the market.3-5 The basic configuration of ESDs includes an
electrode system that is critical to reaching the desired
electrochemical characteristics.6,7 Modern supercapacitorbased energy devices are practical for many grid applications based on their lightweight, fast charge/discharge capabilities, and high energy density.8-11
In general, the electrochemical capacitors can be
divided into three types: electric double layer capacitance

(HC) with further classification based on their inherent
mechanism of faradic and non-faradic processes, as

based electrodes configured with an electrolyte and separator. EDLCs can store charge electrostatically or by a
non-Faradic method. In contrast, the charge storage in
PC occurs via the faradic process. Thus, PC has relatively
higher specific capacitance compared to its EDLC counterparts. The HC, a hybrid of EDLC and PC, could
achieve optimal electrode design, a wider cell voltage
window, and higher energy and power densities than its
single-component counterparts.
Since electrode material plays a key role in defining the
electrochemical profile of ESDs, various materials have
been explored for their efficiency in EDLC and PC devices,
including transition metal oxides (MOs) and carbon materials such as activated carbon,16-19 graphene,20,21 Co3O4,
22
and NiMn-layered double hydroxide (LDH).23 Transition
MOs are a class of materials known for their robust redox
potential, wide availability, and easy processability.24 For
example, Fe2O3 is a widely used negative electrode for
asymmetric PC due to its negative potential window and
high theoretical specific capacitance.25 However, limited
conductivity, low energy density, poor diffusion rate, and
volume expansion/contraction during ion insertion make it
unsuitable for practical applications. Here, an in-depth
molecular level investigation to improve the structural viability without compromising conductivity and rate chargetransfer capability could drastically improve Fe2O3-based
electrodes performance.26 Nevertheless, the practical application of MOs in capacitors or batteries is mainly restricted
by their poor conductivity and structural instability. Several
strategies have been proposed to overcome these bottleneck
issues, including expanding active surface area and modulating the charge-transfer and ionic diffusion pathways for
superior performance. For example, combining EDLC and
PC-based material such as graphene oxide (GO) and activated carbons (AC) configured with MOs have proven
promising.27-29 This combination enabled the reduction of
volumetric density with minimum active material content,
with increased conductivity of MOs-based electrodes.30 Zou
et al reported a mesoporous Co3O4 nanosheets@ graphene
foam material for supercapacitor application.31 The
prepared-3D hierarchical structured Co3O4 nanosheets on
graphene foam exhibited a high specific capacitance
(260 F g1 at 20 A g1
) and rate performance (65% after
1000 cycles at 10 A g1
) compared to its pristine Co3O4
counterpart.
Although the hybrid composite method is promising
toward increasing total capacitance, MOs in their natural
state have other intrinsic limitations that are difficult to
overcome by extrinsic alteration. Here, inducing intrinsic
oxygen defects (oxygen deficiency) have been considered
a relatively simple and efficient intrinsic approach to regulate the electronic characteristic of MOs without
compromising its inherent redox capability. The oxygen
defects could efficiently alter the donor densities of MOs
energy bands, thereby enabling faster kinetics during a
surface redox reaction and thus overall capacitance. The
concept evolved from the enhanced electrochemical performance of TiO2 nanotube arrays after thermal treatment in an H2 environment, where oxygen vacancies
were formed concurrently with the reduction of Ti4+ ions
to Ti3+ ions. The strategy could successfully be considered for the improved capacitance of other MOs such as
M MnO2x Fe2O3,
32 MoO3x,
33,34 WO3x,
34,35 and NiO.36
Altering the interstate defect in MO and increasing the
ionic diffusion rate at the atomic level without disrupting
the structural characteristics of the active materials
would be a more viable route towards superior
performance.
The oxygen vacancy-modified MOs are promising
electrodes for future ESDs configured for the hybrid
renewable energy storage market. This review comprehensively discusses the most recent research progress of
oxygen-deficient MOs-based electrodes primarily used in
SC and batteries. Initially, the need for oxygen vacancy is
discussed, followed by common methods for synthesizing
MOs. The widely used routes to generate oxygen vacancies and their analytical evaluation is detailed, followed
by a dedicated section on the most advanced analytical
techniques presently used to detect and interpret the generation of such vacancies. The section is followed by the
discussion on the impact of oxygen vacancies on the supercapacitive performance of the most widely studied MOs
with endeavors to the challenges and prospects of oxygen
vacancy-based MOs as high-performance electrodes for
supercapacitor devices.
1.1 | The need for oxygen vacancy in MO
electrodes
Previously, oxygen-deficient MOs have shown potential
outcomes in the field of electrocatalyst and water electrolysis.37 In recent work, Cai et al synthesized oxygen
vacant Co3O4 nanosheets to improve the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of electrocatalyst.38
Similarly, Peng et al proposed using NaBH4 to induce
oxygen vacancies in NiCo2O4, CoMn2O4, and NiMn2O4
to improve their water electrolysis performance.39 Inducing oxygen vacancies in MOs is a viable technique for
improving their intrinsic electronic structure, electrical
conductivity, and electrocatalytic activity. The intrinsic
approach has thus attracted significant attention from
the energy storage community based on its capability to
alter the atomic level configuration of MOs without
compromising the structural characteristics. In general,
MOs are partially reduced to a low valance state and

imbued with abundant active sites, allowing for high electron or ion transport channels, thus boosting the electrochemical performances as illustrated in Figure 2A.37,46-48
Unlike pristine MOs, the oxygen vacancy-supported MOs
have demonstrated relatively superior capacitive performance (Figure 2B). For instance, Wang et al used NaBH4 to
reduce Co3O4 nanowires, which improved their energy storage ability when configured as a supercapacitor device.49
Similarly, Tang et al compared the electrochemical
performance of oxygen vacancy-enriched NiMn-LDH
with pristine-NiMn-LDH with the support of theoretical
simulation.50 The density functional theory (DFT)-based
calculation provided an in-depth understanding of the
role of oxygen vacancies and their generation mechanism. The induction of oxygen vacancies in NiMn-LDH
allowed for relatively greater adsorption active sites, contributing to improved redox activity and electrical conductivity during electrolysis reaction. The study reported
improved specific capacity of oxygen vacancy-induced
LDH (Ov-LDH) to reach 1183 C g1 at 1 A g1 with
63.8% retention capability at the 30 A g1
. Meanwhile, as
the anion prefers to connect with hydrogen atoms from
the hydroxyl surface and function as Lewis acid, the pure
NiMn-LDH exhibited negligible adsorption capacity
against hydroxide ions.
The induction of oxygen vacancies is an intrinsic
route to modify the electronic and capacitive characteristics within MOs viably. Interestingly, the defect formation could be initiated using chemical compatible routes,
including doping or in situ synthesis strategies to regulate
the electron donor densities of MOs. The modulation of
donor densities could effectively alter the charge-transfer
kinetics, and thus oxygen vaccines in a material could
significantly control the interfacial redox reaction kinetics. This, in combination with in situ strategy or metal
ion doping, could further manipulate the physicochemical characteristics and thus the electrochemical performance of the materials. Unlike composite materials,
where the combination of material often compromises
structural characteristics, the induction of oxygen vacancies is a relatively safe route to boost the intrinsic properties without any structural or morphological alteration.
Moreover, the oxygen vacancies in MOs could promptly
enlarge their capacitive potential window enabling superior capacitive characteristics besides allowing the modified MOs to act as conductive scaffolds for other hybrid
systems requiring controlled and elaborate morphologies.
1.2 | Synthesis of functional MO
composites
The MO composite materials for supercapacitors are synthesized using various synthesis techniques, including
hydrothermal, solvothermal, electrodeposition, and solgel, as shown in Figure 3A.51-54 Hydrothermal synthesis
is known for its high yield, environmental sustainability,
easiness, and energy efficiency. Various metal salt precursors are combined and firmly confined in an autoclave
reactor along with various precipitating agents or surfactants such as urea, ammonia, and hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) are used to regulate the morphological
characteristics of the final materials.48,55,56 Table 1 compiles the MOs-based supercapacitors produced using the

hydrothermal process. Various crystalline forms, including MOs/hydroxides, could be produced, including honeycomb, yolk-shell, microspheres, mesosphere, flower,
and hexagonal platelets. The hydrothermal method accurately controls crucial parameters essential in obtaining
the desired structure, such as precursor concentration,
reaction time, temperature, and metal to the surfactant/
precipitating agent ratio.55 Honeycomb-like NiMn-LDH
over carbon cloth carbon were synthesized by Shi et al
using NiCl26H2O and MnCl24H2O with HMTA as
growth controlling/precipitation agent.56 Likewise, Kang
et al proposed a hydrothermal synthesis of Fe2O3
nanocomposite over carbon cloth for supercapacitor
application.48 Here, FeCl36H2O precursor and Na2SO4
were homogenized in distilled water and then hydrothermally treated at 160C for 6 hours with carbon cloth in a
Teflon-sealed autoclave. The composites were obtained
following washing and drying of material overnight
at 60C.
In general, hydrothermal treatment is the efficient
and economic route to synthesize MOs with controlled
morphologies and structural characteristics. Moreover,
the hydrothermal process has a high yield limit for MOs,
which is feasible for constructing supercapacitors that
require greater active material content.
1.3 | Oxygen vacancies treatments
The following section generalizes the most commonly
used methods presently employed for inducing oxygen
vaccines in MOs.
1.3.1 | Gas treatment approach
In this method, electrode material induces oxygen vacancies using an appropriate temperature under an oxygendeficient atmosphere. The process could be described by
standard Kröger-Vink notation, in which, creation of oxygen vacancies and their concentration can be defined
using the following equations60:
OL $ Vo þ
1
2
O22þe
CVo ¼ K
n2 ffiffiffiffiffiffiffi
PO2
p ,
where OL, VO, CVO, K, and PO2 stand for the lattice oxygen, oxygen vacancies, the concentration of VO, equilibrium constant, and the oxygen pressure, respectively. The
inverse relationship between CVO and PO2 denotes the
requirement of critical temperature for the production of
oxygen vacancy in a suitable reducing environment. The
oxygen vacancies are generated by the hydrogenation
reaction of MO,32-34,60 where the appropriate temperature
is used under oxygen-deficient atmosphere, such as aircondition,35,36 carbon monoxide (CO),61 ammonia
(NH3),62 nitrogen (N2),63,64 argon (Ar),65 and hydrogen.66
Shen et al used the hydrogenation process for Li4Ti5O12,
where the Ti element was partially reduced Ti3+,
supporting the high conductivity in LIBs.66 Similarly, Lu
et al synthesized two types of electrode material for supercapacitor application black; hydrogenated TiO2 nanotube arrays (H-TiO2) and air annealed TiO2 (air-TiO2).67

In this case, the H-TiO2 sample contained relatively
greater oxygen vacancy state ions (Ti3+ sites) and more
surface hydroxyl groups. The H-TiO2 sampled also realized high carrier density than air-TiO2, showing high
effectiveness of hydrogen reducing atmosphere.
1.3.2 | Solid and solution reaction approach
Contrary to the gaseous-treatment approach, the solid
base techniques involve the induction of MOs with carbon black at high temperature under an inert atmosphere
to create the oxygen vacancy and hence also known as
carbothermal treatment.68,69 Polymers with electrophile
functional groups have also been used to create oxygen
vacancies in MOs.70,71 The application of polymer could
accelerate metal compound reduction and generate oxygen vacancies while delaying Lewis acidic metal ion
hydrolysis. However, solution reactions with low
temperature-based treatment were developed to avoid
high temperatures. In addition, different reducing agents
could produce the oxygen vacancy in the MO.72,73 For
example, NaBH4 solution was introduced as an effective
chemical agent to create oxygen vacancies in CoFe2O4,
WO3, and TiO2. Here, sodium borohydride (NaBH4) was
used as a mild reductant with its working mechanism

).74
1.3.3 | Metallic doping
Interestingly, the elemental doping of metals, nonmetals, and noble metals could also create oxygen vacancies via the metal-thermic reaction.26,33,78-92 The similar
ionic sizes, high solubility, and comparative properties of
these metal classes provide various doping element possibilities in MOs. For instance, Ye et al obtained an ultrahigh capacitive material by doping cobalt (Co) into
Ni(OH)2/Ni3S2 composite cathode, having a specific
capacitance value of 3023.4 F g1 at 1 A g1.93 Furthermore, Jampani et al acknowledged the chemical vapor
deposition method to prepare the titanium (Ti) doped
vanadium dioxide (VO2).94 Their study revealed that doping of Ti and oxygen deficiency could increase the electronic conductivity of the material. In addition, a self-ion
metal doping strategy has been anticipated to create high
valence state dopants that could boost the donor density
of MOs and thus enhance their specific capacitance.
1.3.4 | Plasma treatment approach
Plasma-based treatments are considered promising to
induce oxygen vacancies because of their efficiency, reliability, and environmental friendliness.95-98 The approach is
known for inducing temporary oxygen vacancy via fast
anodization electrochemical reduction of MOs.99 Plasma
treatments are primarily focused on producing enriched
oxygen vacancies in MOs. Here, non-metallic doping (eg, N
and S) supplies high-wave plasma radiation with enriched
oxygen vacancies and doped-cations.76,100 Moon et al designated nitrogen doping-ZnCo2O4 material with the assistance of plasma treatment.101 The oxygen vacancies
enhanced the electrochemical performance of the nitrogendoped ZnCo2O4 nanowires by depositing additional electrons on the vacancy sites.
Figure 3B shows additional routes such as
electrochemical,102-104 flame reduction,105-107 laser
treatment,108-114 and microwave-assisted methods87,115-117 that
are presently used to introduce the oxygen vacancies in MOs.
1.4 | The characterization of oxygendeficient MOs
Since oxygen deficiency generation is a surface-based
process, several advanced analytical tools are used to
evaluate and understand the formation of these vacant
sites.
1.4.1 | Scanning transmission electron
microscopy
This technique provides visual images of material and
estimates the oxygen vacancy concentration.118-120 The
morphological changes in pristine MOs and oxygen
vacancy-enriched MOs are comparatively studied, and
surface impacts such as swelling, surface porosity, and
topographical alternation are evaluated in combination
with other advanced techniques such as electron spin resonance spectroscopy (ESR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Scanning
transmission electron microscopy (STEM)-annular
bright-field and STEM-annular dark-field (ADF) techniques based on contrast dark and bright annular fields
are substantially used in detecting and quantifying oxygen vacancies and defects. Huang et al profiled LiMnO4-
based nanocomposite materials at different x-axis using
STEM-ADF.121 Their observation revealed dark-bright
shade at O-I columns which indicated an oxygen defect
in the dark region. The O columns, on the other hand,
reveal the proper difference to be seen.
1.4.2 | Electron spin resonance spectroscopy
ESR relies on comparing electron density to distinguish
various chemical species. Here, unpaired oxygen electrons with the metal component are used to characterize
unpaired electrons in the metal complex, and thus oxygen vacancies could be quantified. If the signal intensity
or g-factor (electrons) is high, it corresponds to high oxygen vacancy percentages and vice versa.122,123 Very
recently, Chen et al studied the surface oxygen defect in
Ce-doped α-Fe2O3 by ESR analysis.124 The electromagnetic signal of the Ce-doped sample (Fe/Ce = 10:1) at
g = 2.002 was higher than the Ce-free sample, which was
attributed to more electrons confined on oxygen vacancy,
and thus a high concentration of oxygen vacancy was
anticipated.
1.4.3 | X-ray absorption fine structure
spectroscopy
X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (XAFS) is
considered a powerful tool to study oxygen vacancies due
to its high X-ray absorption properties, which could provide oxidation state and density of absorbed atoms over
the surface of materials besides deducing the nature and

their coordination numbers of atoms.125-127 An in situ or
ex situ XAFS might also be utilized to monitor the degree
of electronic structure in a material, allowing for exact
identification of the unfilled oxygen vacancy. For example, Zhou et al used XAFS analysis to study the influence
of Cd over TiO2x nanosheets configured for electrochemical detection of Cu(II).128,129 The addition of Cd
had altered the chemical coordination of Cu(II) over
TiO2x nanosheets; thereby, the Cu 2p peak shifted, generating vacant active sites, which contributed to the electrochemical enhancement of TiO2x nanosheets.
1.4.4 | X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
XPS analysis is primarily used to investigate the surface
elemental composition and chemical condition of a material. The presence of oxygen vacancies is often deduced
from high-resolution XPS profiling of metal surfaces or
by estimating their valency changes.130 Wu et al realized
the existence of oxygen vacancies in MoO3x using XPS
analysis by following its valance state change from Mo6+
to Mo5+, which confirmed the generation of oxygen
defect in MoO3x.
131
In addition to these primary techniques, secondary
techniques include Raman spectroscopy and
photoluminescence spectroscopy. Table 2 compiles the
superior analytical characteristics of the various techniques primarily used to characterize the oxygen vacancies in MOs.
2 | OXYGEN DEFICIENCY IN MOs
The introduction of oxygen deficiency in MOs has
allowed effective manipulation of their electronic and
electrochemical characteristics. The improved synthesis
routes and environmental compatibility have opened up
new possibilities for modified MOs in energy storage,
notably supercapacitors. The following section reviews
the most widely studied MOs and how oxygen deficiency
affects their supercapacitor performance.

capacitance compared to their other counterparts.152 Particularly, molybdenum (Mo)-based oxides have been considered as promising pseudocapacitive (PC) material
owing to their high theoretical capacitance (1256 Fg1 at
1 Ag1
).153 MoO3-based compounds have been combined
with carbon materials or conductive polymers to achieve
the necessary capacitance via improved conductivity.154-160 The partial reduction of Mo to its lower valence
state might allow for high capacitance due to intrinsic
defect development.161 For example, Kim et al reported
two types of MoO3-based electrode materials for PC: 1)
reduced-MoO3 and 2) oxidized MoO3.
116 Here, the
reduced MoO3 allowed a larger layer gap or interlayer
space (ie, commonly referred to as van der Waals gap),
facilitating the conductivity pathways and enabling
improved active specific capacity (Figure 4A).162 The
reduced MoO3 thus realized a higher storage capacity
compared to its oxidized counterpart. Figure 4B shows
the diffraction pattern of reduced MoO3 compared to oxidized MoO3, where a typical peak shift to a lower angle is
evident in the case of reduced-MoO3. The reduced-MoO3
has a higher interlayer spacing (d-spacing), allowing
greater Li-ion insertion/exertion facilitating storage
kinetic compared to its oxidized version. As seen in
Figure 4C,D, the partial reduced MoO3 has a larger
pseudo capacitive region and a relatively higher capacity
of 500 C g1 than oxidized form (<400 C g1
) besides stable cycling performance. The induction of oxygen
vacancy in MO could drastically engineer the interlayer
spacing, thereby allowing intrinsic improvement in the
PC characteristics.
Similarly, Wu et al designed oxygen vacancy-enriched
MoO3 nanobelts through hydrothermal method followed
by the solution reaction method in ethyl alcohol for
improved pseudocapacitance.126 Oxygen vacancyenriched MoO3 (MoO3x) nanobelts were evaluated
against their pristine counterpart. Ethyl alcohol solution
initiated the oxygen vacancy formation resulting in dark
blue MoO3x nanobelts due to valency change of molybdenum atoms. The Mo6+ in the MoO3x nanobelts were
partially reduced to Mo5+ and Mo4+, signifying homogeneous oxygen vacancy distribution in MoO3x nanobelts.
The typical diffraction peaks of MoO3x nanobelts shifted
to a lower angle which further corresponded to the
expansion of its Van der Waal gap (Figure 4B).116 The
nanobelts were later evaluated for their electrochemical
performance in a very low temperature-bearing electrolyte prepared using a mixture of sulfuric acid and ethylene glycol (H2SO4/EG). Interestingly, the MoO3x
nanobelts delivered an ultrahigh specific capacitance of
1230 F g1 at the current density of 5 A g1 at 25C, virtually identical to the theoretical capacitance of pure
MoO3 (Figure 5B,C). As the temperature was lowered to
0C, the specific capacitance raised to 1114 F g1 due to
the excellent wettability of H2SO4/EG electrolyte, which
ensures the rapid transmission of H+ in MoO3x
nanobelts, thus ensuring the full use of MoO3x
nanobelts 5 A g1

Similarly, Lu et al introduced nanosheet-MoO3x
through hydrothermal treatment followed by hydrogenation heat treatment in pure H2 gas at 300C for 30 minutes.
The as-obtained reduced nanosheets exhibited high capacitance of 1480 F g1 at 5 A g1 and outstanding cycling performance. The capacitance does not decay but increases
slightly up to 10 000 cycles at a scan rate of 100 mV s1
.
They believe that this excellent performance results from a
higher degree of utilization of the active sites obtained after
introducing the oxygen deficiency.
2.2 | Iron (III) oxide
Fe2O3-based MOs also provide comparative electrochemical performances with other MOs-based materials due to
their high electron donor capability, low cost, nontoxicity, and suitable potential window in the negative
PC region.127,163,164 Despite these advantages, many
efforts have been made to improve the electrochemical
performance for Fe2O3-based MOs in combination with
nonconductive165,166 and conductive materials.167-169
However, the low conductivity (ca. 104 S cm1
) and high
expansion volume during the charge and discharge
process limit the electrochemical performance of Fe2O3-
based electrodes.170 In this regard, oxygen vacancyenriched Fe2O3 MO materials might be a viable route to
modulate the intrinsic characteristics and enhance the
donor density of Fe2O3 to increase their charge storage
capacity. For example, Lu et al prepared an oxygendeficient Fe2O3
171 via FeOOH nanorods annealed at
400C under an N2 atmosphere. The study revealed that
the reduced Fe2O3 had a high energy density than its airtreated counterpart, with a high areal specific capacitance
of 382.7 mF cm2 at 0.5 mA cm2
. In comparison with
the study of Lu et al,171 Sun et al introduced oxygen
vacancy in Fe2O3 through the solution reaction method
with NaBH4 reductant.43 The Fe2O3x integrated
graphene revealed nanorod arrays type morphology with
a unique crystalline core/amorphous shell
heterostructure. They believe that a tunable amorphous
layer helps the Li-ion diffusion while induced oxygen
defects in Fe2O3 can be effectively tuned to improve electronic conductivity. The Fe2O3 exhibited richer oxygen
vacancies than its annealed counterpart with enhanced
performance (α-Fe2O3 = 701 F g1 at 1 A g1
). The
improvement in the specific capacitance, in this case, was
also attributed to the strong reducing behavior of the

NaBH4 reductant. A simple, more cost-effective, and
reducant-free procedure was developed to directly synthesize oxygen-deficient-Fe2O3 negative electrodes.32
Figure 6A shows that the oxygen-deficient α-Fe2O3 was
synthesized from the iron (III) aqueous nitrate solution
by adjusting the hydrothermal reaction temperature in
the range from 100 to 180C. As shown in Figure 6B, the
obtained XPS-high-resolution at O1s spectrum of pristine
α-Fe2O3 and oxygen-deficient Fe2O3 (α-Fe2O3-Vo) demonstrate the high-intensity peak at 531.8 eV, indicating
higher defects in α-Fe2O3-Vo, which corresponds with
the lattice defects or oxygen-vacancy in α-Fe2O3-Vo.172
The current response of the pristine Fe2O3 is lower than
that of the oxygen-deficient α-Fe2O3 (Figure 6C), which
indicates the oxygen vacancies inside α-Fe2O3 could significantly enhance the electrochemical properties such as
specific capacitance, charge-discharge time, as well the
areal-specific capacitance. The α-Fe2O3 exhibited highest
specific capacitance of 862.12 mF cm2 at 1 mA cm2
compared to the reported material without oxygen-deficient, such as α-Fe2O3 nanotubes (180.4 mF cm2 at
1 mA cm2
),170 α-Fe2O3/C nanoarray (430.8 mF cm2 at

).140
Moreover, Dong et al synthesized oxygen-abundant
Fe2O3 (O-Fe2O3) composite material with PANI on carbon cloth (O-Fe2O3@PANI).175 PANI is designed in situ
on oxygen vacancy-Fe2O3 and simultaneously forms a
porous PANI skeleton, thus inventing a hierarchical
structure of O-Fe2O3 particles connected by a conductive
frame. In comparison with pristine Fe2O3 and O- Fe2O3,
the composite O-Fe2O3@PANI revealed high cycling stability of 90% at 10,000 cycles at the current density of
10 A g1

309 F g1 at 0.5 A g1

protocols.176-179 However, the sluggish reaction kinetics
and poor conductivity subsequent to the limited active
sites are major challenges in its practical advancement.180
The oxygen vacancy-based Co2O3 materials are getting
much attention due to drastic improvement in their
active site concentration. In this regard, Xiang et al synthesized 2D oxygen-deficient Co2O3 nanosheet composite
materials using H2/N2 and NaBH4 as reducing agents.45
The pristine Co3O4 (pristine-Co3O4), Co3O4 treated with
H2/N2 (H200-Co3O4 NSs), and Co2O3 treated with NaBH4
(OVR-Co3O4 NSs) were competitively evaluated as illustrated in Figure 7A. As expected, the OVR-Co3O4 NSs
realized higher oxygen vacant sites owing to the strong
reductive nature of the NaBH4. Figure 7B shows that the
OVR-Co3O4 NSs had a higher oxidation ratio of Co2+/
Co3+ than H200-Co3O4 NSs and pristine-Co3O3, with the
calculated amount of oxygen vacancy for OVR-Co3O4
NSs reaching 45%. The larger oxygen vacancy percentage
in OVR-Co3O4 NSs results in greater active sites allowing
superior charge storage capacity than H200-Co3O4 NSs
and pristine-Co2O3 (Figure 7C).
Similarly, Zhang et al introduced oxygen-deficient
Co3O4-NSs on carbon nanotubes (CNTs), denoted as
Co3O4-NSs/CNT.181 In their study, NaBH4 treatment was
used to prepare oxygen-deficient Co3O4-NSs previously
grown directly over CNTs. The nanocomposite material
with 5% mass of CNTs exhibited an ultrahigh specific
capacitance of 1280.4 F g1 at 1 A g1 with high retention percentage of 112.5% after 10 000 cycles, as a result
of their ultrathin structure, rich oxygen vacancies, and
the electrochemical synergism between Co3O4-NSs
and CNTs.
To prevent the environment from H2/N2 or NaBH4-
based toxic reducing agents, Yang et al designed a straightforward method to prepare ultrafine Co2O3@graphene
materials with oxygen vacancies for supercapacitor

electrodes.182 Interestingly, the ultrafine Co2O3@graphene
material with oxygen vacancy (UCNG) was prepared via
laser irradiation without any reducing agent. The laserinduced reduction and fragmentation (size reduction) were
carried over the mixture of GO and as-prepared ultrafine
Co2O3 (P-Co2O3) (Figure 8). The UCNG composite had a
Co2+ oxidation state, confirming the reduction of Co3+ to
Co2+ and indicating oxygen vacancy formation within the
interlayer spaces. UCNG composite has a strong redox couple response (Figure 8B) at a high scan rate of 100 mV S1
and thus delivered a high discharge rate (Figure 8C). The
composite delivered a high-rate capability and capacitance
retention of 93.7% when the current density was raised
from 1 to 10 A g1
. Accordingly, ultrafine Co2O3@graphene
materials with oxygen vacancy exhibit a higher specific
capacitance of 978.1 Fg1 at 135.8 mA h g1
, which was
significantly higher than its vacancy-free counterpart.183-186
Furthermore, the anion doping in Co2O3 is an exciting
route to create active sites via oxygen vacancy.180 Inducing
anion element (fluorine or palladium) can induce disorder
in lattice crystallinity of nanocomposite materials, resulting
in many active sites or partial reduction of the metal
anion.187 For example, Hao et al designed oxygen vacancyenriched Co2O3@Ni nanocomposite cathode materials for
asymmetric supercapacitors.58 In a competitive evaluation,
Pd-doped Co2O3@Ni foam (Pd-Co2O3) was studied against
its non-doped counterpart. Here, a significant improvement
in crystalline defects of Pd-Co2O3 nanocomposites was realized compared to Co2O3@Ni foam, which indicated highdensity lattice sites or, in other words, the formation of
oxygen vacancy subsequent to Pd doping. The presence of
oxygen vacancies in Pd-Co2O3 nanocomposite improved
retention capacity and areal capacitance with a specific
capacitance reach of 1353 F g1 at the current density of
7 mA cm2
. However, the high cost of Pd metal was realized as a major limitation in promoting the Pd doped composite material for advanced energy storage applications.
Thus, a low-cost anion (F-doping)-based approach for modification of Co2O3 could be a more viable option to reach
desired electrochemical characteristics that could facilitate
Co2O3 toward more competitive energy storage domains.

with its high theoretical specific capacity has proven to be
an ideal candidate for ternary composites where the coupling of Co2O3 with other metals could facilitate redox and
rate capability.188 These nanocomposites, however, have
sluggish kinetics and poor electrochemical stability. Thus,
the creation of oxygen vacancies may be able to overcome
these disadvantages. Liu et al designed a strategy to synthesize the fluorine-doped and oxygen-enriched Co2MnO4
nanowires grown on carbon fibers (CFs), as illustrated in
Figure 9A.40 The F-doping could promote the higher lattice
energy and suppress the polarization, whereas the oxygen
vacancy could partially reduce metal ions and crystalline
defects. Thus, high electrochemical performance for quasisolid-state asymmetric supercapacitors could be anticipated.
The study compared pristine Co2MnO4@CF, fluorine-doped
Co2MnO4@CF (F-Co2MnO4), and fluorine-doped Co2MnO4@CF with fluorine-doped oxygen-deficient Co2MnO4
(F-Co2MnO4x). Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)
analysis was carried to confirm the formation of vacancies
where the symmetrical signal at magnetic field analogous
to g value was observed for each sample, as shown in
Figure 9B. The g value of 1.95 indicated the presence of oxygen vacancy. The paramagnetic peak intensity of sample FCo2MnO4x was much higher than other samples, specifying the F-Co2MnO4x sample had more oxygen vacancies
due to F-doping.189 The CV performance of the materials
corresponds to the possible reversible Faradaic redox reactions as described using the following equations158,190,191:
Co2MnO4 þH2OþOH ⇌ MnOOHþ2CoOOHþe ð1Þ
CoOOHþOH ⇌ CoO2 þH2Oþe ð2Þ
MnOOHþOH ⇌ MnO2 þH2Oþe: ð3Þ
Besides, the specific capacities of materials were
recorded at different current densities with measurement
of capacity retention at 15 C (A g1
). The F-Co2MnO4x
was determined to have superior performance with high
charge storage capacity and stability (Figure 9C,D). The
superior performance was attributed to the more significant number of low valence Co2+, and Mn2+ ions generated post doping of fluorine or partially replacing lattice
O2 with F ions. These low valence cations could facilitate conductivity based on mixed-valence electron skipping, which ultimately boosts the redox kinetic and thus
increases the electrochemical performance of the FCo2MnO4x.
Recently, phosphorous (P)-doped oxygen-deficient
Co2MnO4x were designed by Xiang et al.192 Herein, a
double defect (ie, oxygen vacancy and P-doping) were
introduced into Co2MnO4 nanowires (P-Co2MnO4x) to
enhance the redox kinetics and provide more electrochemical active centers, which contributed to the excellent specific capacitance of 838 F g1 at 1 A g1
.

Furthermore, in situ fabrication of Co2NiO4x@nitrogen-deficient graphitic carbon nitride (OvNiCo2O4/ND-g-C3N4) was designed by Hou et al, as
illustrated in Figure 10A.193 Here, graphitic carbon
nitride (g-C3N4) was altered into nitrogen-deficient graphitic carbon nitride (ND-g-C3N4) at a low annealing
temperature. The ND-g-C3N4 acted as a conductive carbon material that could promote electron transportation
and enhance the active surface area besides inducing
high oxygen vacancies in Co2NiO4. The g-C3N4 is a
known substrate material rich with electron lone pairs.
However, the semiconducting nature limits its capability to act as a conductivity substrate.194-199 Therefore,
the partial elimination of N atoms from g-C3N4 the
frame was attempted to form graphitic sp2
-C arrangements and enhance the conductivity of the
nanocomposite materials.200-202 The XPS analysis revealed the atomic state and chemical composition for gC3N4, NiCo2O4, and Ov-NiCo2O4/ND-g-C3N4-310C.
Figure 10B shows that the carbon 1s peak of pure gC3N4 was determined at 284.7 eV (sp2
). However, as a
result of steady oxidative breakdown of the polymeric
melon in g-C3N4, the C 1s peak signal of Ov-NiCo2O4/
ND-g-C3N4 were partially changed to C, N/C-C, and
C-N with the intensity of 284.8 eV (sp2
), 285.4 eV (sp3
),
and 288.5 eV (sp3
), respectively.203 This confirms the
partial deficiency of N atoms and the formation of graphitic sp2
-C. Raman analysis was consistent with XPS
where broad D and G bands of Ov-NiCo2O4/ND-gC3N4310 had a relatively high intensity with higher
Co2+/Co3+ and Ni2+/Ni3+ ratios (Figure 10C). This confirmed the reduction of metal ions to lower valance
states, that is, Co3+ to Co2+ and Ni3+ to Ni2+, suggesting
interlayer oxygen vacancy formation.39 The OvNiCo2O4/ND-g-C3N4-310 delivered a promising capacitance of 1998 F g1 at 2 C (A g1
), higher than its pristine counterpart.
Recently, the transition metal molybdate (XMoO4,
where X = Ni, Co, Zn, or Fe) has attracted substantial
attention due to its high conductivity. Several composite

197 as well as hybrids including NiMoO4@NiCo-S nanorods on nickel foam,198 CoMoO4-MnO2@-

metal and molybdate has proven promising based on the
abundance of redox species or their accessibility. However, intrinsic resistance is still a major challenge in realizing the desired performance. Here, oxygen vacancyenriched XMoO4x could be anticipated to overcome the
electric resistance and improve the overall supercapacitive performance. Li et al designed an oxygen
vacancy rich-CoMoO4@Ni foam-based composite to
enhance the electrochemical performance of asymmetric
supercapacitor.44 As shown in Figure 11A, CoMoO4x
were prepared by the hydrogenation process, whereas the
Mo6+ was reduced to low valance Mo4+, followed by calcination at 400C for 1 hour under H2/Ar (10/90 vol%)
atmosphere.204 The SEM images demonstrated a larger
pore size for CoMoO4x than CoMoO4, post hydrogenation reaction, suggesting large inter-layer spaces
(Figure 11B). In addition, the BET surface area of
CoMoO4x and CoMoO4 were measured to be 61 and
36 m2 g-1, respectively. Figure 11C shows the diffraction
pattern of CoMoO4x and CoMoO4, where poor crystallinity with lower diffraction peaks was observed for
CoMoO4x, confirming the partial reduction of Mo.205
XPS further confirmed the partial reduction of Mo6+ to
Mo4+ during the hydrogenation process (Figure 11D).
The CoMoO4x, when configured into the electrode,
exhibited a higher specific capacity of 1989 F g1 at

Among the conductive substrates, graphene-based conductive materials have received much attention owing
to their 2D layered structure. The particular layered
configuration of LDH, where metal ions are grouped
inside the interlayer spaces, provides an abundant
channel for ion diffusion. Thus, LDH-based composites
are anticipated to reach a large specific capacity
(Figure 12A).218 Interestingly, the electronic mid-gap
between two layers could also host oxygen vacancies,
boosting the inherent electrochemical properties. However, the production of oxygen vacancy-enriched LDH
material in situ has not been well investigated. A
NiMn-LDH@Ni foam (OV-LDH)-based material was
reported using an in situ electrodeposition procedure
where OV-LDH was treated with H2O2 for vacancy formation (Figure 12B).50 The morphologies of asprepared NiMn-LDH and OV-LDH revealed abundant
active sites with flower-shaped particles after oxidation
in H2O2. The oxygen vacancy (Ov) and hydroxyl (OOH)
peak area ratio of NiMn-LDH and OV-LDH were
defined from O 1s XPS spectra with Ov peak ratio for
OV-LDH were 36.40% greater than NiMn-LDH
(19.67%). The OOH ratio of NiMn-LDH also declined
from 44.13% in NiMn-LDH to 34.21% in Ov-LDH due
to partial reduction of OH-species after electrodeposition in H2O2 as described by the following equations:

The unpaired electrons were later validated by EPR,
where Ov-LDH had a more prominent EPR signal peak
at the g value of 2.001, suggesting a high proportion of
oxygen vacancies (Figure 12C). The electrochemical
characteristics of NiMn-LDH and Ov-LDH were analyzed against the platinum plate as the counter electrode. Figure 12D shows that the Ov-LDH exhibited a
higher current value in the voltage range of 0.1 to
0.6Vwith the specific capacitance reach of 1183 C g1 at
1Ag1 and capacity retention of 63.8% at the 30 A g1
(Figure 12E).201,219-221
Recently, Wang and Jin synthesized an oxygendeficient CoAl-LDH via hydrothermal method following
NaHB4 treatment.222 The specific capacitance of obtained
Ov-CoAl LDHs reached 799.2 F g1 at 1 A g1

than the pristine counterpart. Moreover, Liang et al synthesized an oxygen-vacancy-rich NiCo LDH nanowire
array by reducing the pristine LDHs by NaBH4. The VoNiCo LDH showed specific capacitance, 1.57 folds higher
than its pristine competitor, that is, NiCo LDH."

regarded as one of the feasible strategies because they can inherit
both the merits of battery-type and capacitive electrodes,
facilitating boosting of energy density and concurrent
maintenance of high power density.8 As for fabricating highperformance HSCs, the core lies on seeking suitable electroactive material combination and designing special device
configuration. Nowadays, some emerging two-dimensional
(2D) nanomaterials, including metal oxides,9 (oxy) hydroxides,10 chalcogenides,11−13 MXene,14,15 and metal−organic
frameworks (MOFs),16 have been identified to be prospective
electroactive substances toward HSCs owing to their high
surface-to-volume ratio, plentifully available active sites, and
unique physicochemical properties as well as excellent
mechanical performance.
In the abovementioned 2D materials, the layered double
hydroxides (LDH) have attracted substantial interest on
account of their tunable composition and structure that
endow diverse properties, and they show promising applications
for HSCs because they possess pseudo-capacitive or battery-like
behaviors and own high theoretical specific capacity.17−21
However, the easy phase transformation22 and intrinsically
poor electronic conductivity (10−10−10−14 mS cm−1
) of LDH23
will impair their cycle and rate capability, greatly hindering their
actual applications in HSCs. To circumvent those weaknesses,
several strategies have been adopted, such as forming trimetallic
LDH,24 tailoring defects and strains,25 and hybridizing with
other highly conductive materials.26−28 Compared with
common bimetallic LDH, the trimetallic LDH often show
enhanced electrochemical properties because incorporating
another metal can tune the electronic structure of the original
bimetallic LDH and reinforce the synergy of guest and host
metals.29 Marrying the desired trimetallic LDH with other
conducting materials for producing advanced or well-coupled
nanohybrids (NHs) could further improve their electrochemical
performance. As one class of novel 2D materials, MXenes
possess a high electronic/ionic conductivity, variable components, and an excellent capacitive performance,30−32 providing
another capacitive materials “treasure-house” beyond the
routine carbon-based ones for marrying with LDH to obtain
advanced hybrid electrodes.33,34 For instance, Zhu and coauthors prepared NiCoAl-LDH/V4C3Tx NHs with interconnected porous network microstructures and found that such
NHs exhibited a greatly enhanced specific capacity (627 C g−1 at
1Ag−1
), rate capability, and cycling performance as compared
to pure NiCoAl-LDH nanosheets.35 By surveying the current
trimetallic LDH/MXene family, the few-layered NiMnZnLDH/MXene NHs may be an ideal candidate since they inherit
the advantages of both kinds of 2D materials and contain
amphoteric Zn atoms that could be etched to engrave nano/
micropores or create rich defects,36 offering a new opportunity
employing defect engineering to tune their electrochemical
performance. Unfortunately, there are nearly no reports on
fabricating NiMnZn-LDH/MXene NHs until now, and their
applications in HSCs are not explored; especially, hybridization
and defect engineering are not concurrently applied for boosting
their electrochemical performance.
Herein, we report the preparation of oxygen-vacancy-rich
NiMnZn-LDH/Mo2CTx 2D-on-2D NHs by electrostatic
assembly of the alkaline-etched NiMnZn-LDH (eLDH) nanosheets and Mo2CTx MXene and their applications in asymmetric
all-solid-state HSCs. Such eLDH/Mo2CTx NHs possess the
following merits: (1) The Mo2CTx MXene can provide
conductive channels in the rapid Faradaic reaction process
and suppress the re-stacking of eLDH nanosheets, advantageous
to maximally expose their surfaces or edge active sites. (2) The
strategy of etching Zn atoms could well tune the valence states of
Ni/Mn active atoms and produce abundant oxygen defects in
eLDH that are helpful to electrochemical applications. (3) The
strong coupling of eLDH and Mo2CTx can further regulate the
surface electronic structures and oxygen vacancy content of
eLDH. Benefiting from those merits, the resultant eLDH/
Mo2CTx NHs exhibit a greatly enhanced specific capacity (1577
C g−1 at 2 A g−1
) and cycling stability as well as good rate
capability relative to pure eLDH, Mo2CTx, and NiMnZn-LDH.
By employing such 2D-on-2D NHs and Fe2O3/carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as positive (P) and negative (N) electrodes,
respectively, three kinds of asymmetric all-solid-state HSCs are
constructed with the normal PN-type and unconventional PNPtype and NPN-type device geometries. Among them, the
fabricated PNP-type device exhibits a maximal energy density of
92.6 Wh kg−1 at 2695 W kg−1 (computed by considering the
total weight of electrode materials), exceeding PN-type devices,
NPN-type devices, and most of the other investigated HSCs.
Importantly, even if the power density reaches 6906 W kg−1
, the
PNP-type device could deliver far higher energy density than
PN-type devices, NPN-type devices, and other reported HSC."
235_intro.txt.txt,"Introduction 
The massive depletion of fossil fuels has resulted in some global 
environmental issues, including serious global warming, pollution, 
and geopolitical problems, which need to be alleviated urgently 
[1–5]. Electricity, as an important kind of clean energy resource, has 
always triggered widespread attention from both academia and industry for its excellent renewability [6–8]. In recent years, many 
researchers have been increasingly interested in the storage devices, 
mainly including batteries and supercapacitors (SCs). Among numerous devices, the electrochemical supercapacitors have some 
advantages of power density, safe operation, long cycle life, and 
unique storage properties [3,9,10], but the low energy density greatly 
restricts the application of supercapacitors [11,12]. Notably, electrode 
material is the key component in supercapacitor and determines the 
capacity of supercapacitors to a large extent. Therefore, the demand 
for higher energy density inspires us to carry out the in-depth research in developing a novel high-capacitance electrode material [13–16]. 
At present, transition metal oxides as the prospective pseudocapacitive-electrode materials in asymmetric supercapacitors have 
attracted intensive attention by virtue of their low cost, environmental friendliness, high natural abundance [17–20]. Additionally, 
more and more studies have shown that mixed transition metal 
oxides outperform their monometallic and bimetallic counterparts. 
For example, Kumar et al. [21], Bandyopadhyay et al. [22], and 
Acharya et al. [23] synthesized Co-Ni-Zn-O on nickel foam with a 
simple hydrothermal method. They found that Co-Ni-Zn-O electrode 
exhibited the higher charging capacity and rate capability than the 
corresponding monometallic and bimetallic oxides because of the 
more redox reactions. However, its poor inherent poor charge 
transfer ability and insufficient active sites lead to sluggish reaction 
kinetics, which severely limits its application and development. 
Recently, some reports have suggested that oxygen vacancies are 
able to promote redox activity, accelerate ion and electron transport 
and thereby advance the electrochemical reaction kinetics of electrode material, which can be introduced by anion doping (such as P, 
B, N, and S) [16]. For example, P doping improved the electrochemical properties of Co–Ni–S nanosheets and provided a high 
specific capacitance of 3677 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, which was assigned to 
the significant increase in the active centers resulted from the 
doping of heteroatoms [24]. Liu et al. [25] explored the effects of Fdoped and oxygen vacancies on Co2MnO4. The result of density

functional theory (DFT) showed that the oxygen vacancies reduced 
the band gap, which facilitated electron transfer and increased the 
electronic conductivity. 
Usually, the transition metal sulfide electrode materials have 
better electrical conductivity than the transition metal oxide. But the 
complete or excessive vulcanization may lead to the poor multiplicative and cycling performance for the electrode materials [26]. 
Moreover, the electronegativity of S elements is much smaller than 
that of O elements, which can be more likely to generate many 
oxygen vacancies. Based on the above considerations, it is feasible to 
further upgrade the performance of ZNCO by adding more oxygen 
vacancies by introducing sulfur element. 
In this work, S-doped zinc-cobalt-nickel oxides on nickel foams 
nanorods were designed and synthesized using Sodium sulfide as 
the S source by a simple hydrothermal method followed by ion exchange. In the first step, the ZNCO nanoneedles were even grown on 
the nickel foam through hydrothermal and annealing. Then, the SZNCO electrode material was obtained by the hydrothermal sulfurization of ZNCO nanoneedles. The S atoms are doped to introduce 
oxygen vacancies to boost the electrical conduction of the electrode 
material. We have tested the electrochemical properties and conductivity of the S-ZNCO using a two-electrode system, and the energy density and power density of the assembled supercapacitor 
device. The higher specific capacitance and conductivity of the 
synthesized S-ZNCO (2919.60 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) compared to pure 
ZNCO (933 F g−1) is assigned to the synergistic effect of S doping and 
oxygen vacancies. Furthermore, the assembled S-ZNCO/NF// AC supercapacitor achieves a high energy density of 72.97 W h kg−1 at a 
power density of 825 W kg−1."

To meet the ever-increasing energy demand and the rapidly
growing market for portable electronic devices and modern electric vehicles, many researchers are working on the fabrication and
investigation of advanced technologies for harnessing and storing
renewable energy. To date, batteries and supercapacitors are the
potential systems to tackle the energy storage challenge [1]. Specifically, supercapacitors have gained much attention owing to their
simple operational mechanism, high power density, long cyclic life
(>100,000 cycles), fast charge and discharge rates, low maintenance costs, and safe operation as compared to batteries [2]. Based
on the energy storage mechanism, supercapacitors are classified

into electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) where charge accumulation takes place via physical adsorption at the vicinity of the
electrode/electrolyte interface forming electric double layer, and
pseudocapacitors or redox capacitors in which charges are being
stored upon fast and reversible faradaic charge-transfer reactions
at the electrode surface/near-surface interface [3]. Notably, there
is a third type called “intercalation pseudocapacitance” in which
charges accumulate in the bulk of the electrode through a rapid
intercalation process that occurs without crystallographic phase
change and on the same timescale as redox pseudocapacitance [4].
In particular, pseudocapacitors, usually made of transition metal
oxides, have been widely studied owing to their high theoretical specific capacitance and electrochemical stability [5]. Moreover,
transition metals are abundant and cheap. Despite all these advantages, the actual specific capacitance values of pseudocapacitors are still low due to variety of factors, including their limited surface area, agglomeration, slow reaction kinetics causing

poor cycling stability, and their remarkably low conductivity [6].
To this end, advanced nanostructured materials are being explored
to enhance the pseudocapacitive properties of transition metal oxides and to increase their energy density. In this regard, RuO2 is
known to be the best electrode material for pseudocapacitors because of its remarkable large specific capacitance (700 F/g), low
resistance, and high chemical and thermal stability [7]. Nevertheless, RuO2-based pseudocapacitors tend to be too expensive. This
motivates researchers to explore new transition metal oxides with
high mesoporosity [8], hollow nanostructures [9], and variable dimensionality [10] in different combinations [11–13] and different
crystal forms such as perovskites [14], double perovskites [15] and
spinels [16]. However, these materials exhibited unsatisfactory performance.
Among the various transition metal oxide, tungsten oxide
(WO3) is emerging as one of the most potential candidate materials for supercapacitors. WO3 is an n-type indirect bandgap semiconductor with a slightly monoclinic distorted ReO3-type structure at room temperature [17]. It possesses five polymorphs,
namely tetragonal (αWO3), orthorhombic (β-WO3), monoclinic I
( γ -WO3), monoclinic II ( ε-WO3), and triclinic ( δ-WO3), yet γ -
WO3 is the most stable form at room temperature [17]. It exhibits distinctive physicochemical, photo/electro-catalytic properties, stability in aqueous solutions against photocorrosion, and
superior incident photo-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCEs)
[18]. Therefore, WO3 is used in a plethora of applications, including
visible-light-driven photocatalysis, photoelectrochemical cells, electrochromic displays, batteries, and gas sensors [19–24]. Despite all
those unique properties, the properties of final powders are substantially dependent on the structural transformation changes, the
sub-stoichiometric phases, and the morphology of the used WO3.
Thus, careful control over the aforementioned parameters has been
taken to get the desired properties.
Hexagonal WO3 (h-WO3) phase is a metastable phase with a
specific lattice arrangement that provides large available storage
sites (trigonal cavity, hexagonal, and 4-coordinated square window) [25]. It can host cations such as hydrogen that are stabilized
upon preparation under controlled conditions. Hydrogen insertion
into h-WO3 cavities during synthesis results in another class of oxides that are called hydrogen tungsten bronze (HTB), which has
the chemical formula of HxWO3 (x in the range from 0.1 to 0.6).
HTB is non-stoichiometric, mixed-valence oxide (W5+ and W6+)
materials [26], belong to the family of tungsten bronzes AxWO3
(A: alkali atoms), which have been the subject of intensive research in the past decades owing to their rich crystallographic
chemistry in addition to their exceptional metallic conductivities
[27]. HTB is usually prepared by the reduction of tungstic oxide
either through a specially constructed Jones reductor [28] or under hydrogen flow in the presence of metals such as Cu [29]. The
mechanochemical or mechanical alloying method has also been
adopted as a synthesis route for the HTB [30]. Recently, multistep procedures have been performed in the fabrication of HTB,
such as electrodeposition employing polystyrene template [31],
low-temperature solution-process using ethanol [32], and reduction of metal oxide by gallium-based liquid metals at room temperature [33]. However, these methods are time-consuming or expensive processes.
This work presents a facile low-temperature hydrothermal
method for preparing a novel HTB in a one-step process without utilizing metal catalysts or exposing the samples to a reducing atmosphere; in addition to the preparation of classical WO3
phases well. Tungsten oxides are prepared with the aid of different
structure-directing agents to have control over morphology. The
study aims at elucidating the differences in the structure, defect
contents, and optical characteristics between the HTB and h-WO3.
Moreover, electrochemical investigations are carried out for both
tungsten oxide and bronze to assess their potential use in supercapacitors. These measurements include cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge processes, and electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy. Herein, for the first time, a kinetic study is performed to evaluate the type of storage mechanism in the novel
phase with respect to the classical oxide."

of multiple morphologies for MoO3-x, such as nanobelts,29 sead-like mesoporous

skeleton like N-doped tubular graphene (N-GNT) could be introduced to create a 
hybrid three-dimensional (3D) interconnected network structure, with high 
electrical conductivity, which could effectively increase the corrosion/oxidation 
resistances and robust mechanical strength.32-39 Particularly, the designed N-GNTs 
offering peculiar hollow characteristics are able to serve as an “ion reservoir”, 
guaranteeing the continuous supply of ions, as well as to provide a large accessible 
surface area with open space for expediting the diffusion of electrolyte ions into the 
inside of the electrode active layer. Thus, the combined design of oxygen vacancies

because the Mn3+/Mn4+ redox couple after pre-insertion can induce a high oxygen 
evolution potential in the formed birnessite-type NaxMnO2 compound to extend the

the N-GNTs are designed as an excellent skeleton combined with the pre-inserted

The rapid development of various portable electronic 
devices, solar energy systems, hybrid electric vehicles, wind 
energy systems, power grid distributed storage, communications, aerospace and other industries has greatly promoted 
the demand for high-performance, low-cost, environmental 
protection energy storage equipment [1–5]. As a newly 
developing energy storage device, supercapacitors (SCs) 
have the advantages of high-power density, good cycle stability, fast charge and discharge speed, which build a bridge 
between secondary batteries and traditional capacitors and 
occupy an important position [6–11]. Nevertheless, the practical applications of SCs are still restricted due to the relatively low energy density. In the light of the energy density 
equation (
E = 1

CV2
)
, increasing the specifc capacitance 
and voltage window of SCs is the key to realize high energy 
density of SCs [12–17]. As an important part of supercapacitor, electrode plays an important role in charge storage. In 
this regard, exploring high-capacitance electrodes would be 
an efective mean to boost the energy density of SCs.
To date, various electrodes based on carbon-based materials, conducting polymers and transition metal oxides have 
been widely studied [18–21, 45–47]. In comparison with 
transition metal oxides, carbon materials and conductive 
polymer demonstrate lower specifc capacitance [19, 22, 
23]. Amongst them, ferric oxide (Fe2O3) holds great promise because of low-cost, abundant reserves, friendly environment and high theoretical specifc capacitance [24–29]. 
However, the reported Fe2O3 electrodes delivers relatively 
poor specifc capacitance and weak electrochemical cyclability due to the following challenges: (i) the intrinsically inferior electrical conductivity, and (ii) the volume expansion/
contraction during repeating ion insertion and desorption, 
leading to the collapse of part of the structure [29–31].
The introduction of defect in Fe2O3 enabling the change 
of Fermi level has been proposed to alleviate the abovementioned problems because of the improved intrinsic electronic conductivity. Specifcally, oxygen vacancy defect has 
been demonstrated to be capable of changing the electronic

Although the enhanced conductivity would improve the specifc capacitance and electrochemical cyclability, the structural stability of Fe2O3 is still far from the carbon materials-based electrodes and thus needs to be further improved 
[24, 33]. In response to the above issue, coating a protective 
shell including carbon material and conductive polymers on 
Fe2O3 has been proved to be an efcacious method. Nevertheless, carbon materials or conductive polymers is relatively 
dense, which hinders the difusion of electrolytic ions from 
the electrolytic solution to the surface of electrode materials, 
deteriorating the capacitive performance [30, 34–36]. In this 
case, the conductive polymer with porous network structure has broad application prospects because of its simple 
synthesis, easy adhesion and stable structure [18, 37–40]. 
Therefore, it is a reliable and efective method to enhance 
the electronic conductivity, structural stability and capacitive 
performance of Fe2O3 based composites by using conducting polymers with porous network structure. Our group has 
demonstrated the application of porous structured conducting polymer in improving capacitive performance of Fe2O3
electrodes, but the cycling performance of Fe2O3 composite 
electrode still have a long way for the practical application.
In this study, we demonstrated a high stable electrode 
comprising of Fe2O3 nanoneedles with oxygen vacancy 
defects and conductive polyaniline hydrogel coating. The 
electrode was fabricated by the in situ growth of Fe2O3
nanoneedles on carbon cloth and the subsequently chemical 
reduction reaction as well as the in situ polymerization of 
aniline. The electrochemical performance of O-Fe2O3@polyaniline electrode has been thoroughly studied. Impressively, 
the as-designed O-Fe2O3@PANI not only shows enhanced 
cyclical stability (90% after 10,000 cycles at 10 A g−1), but 
also exhibits an improved specifc capacitance (309 F g−1
at 0.5 A g−1). Furthermore, the symmetrical supercapacitor (SSC) assembled by O-Fe2O3@PANI presents a highenergy density of 12.125 Wh kg−1 at a high-power density 
of 250 W kg−1 and notable cyclical stability (100% retention 
over 10,000 cycles)."

pseudocapacitors.6-7 Carbon-based materials used in EDLCs have a comparatively low 
energy density owing to their inherent properties, which seriously limits their practical 
application.4, 8 Compared with carbon-based materials, pseudocapacitive materials 
possesse larger specific capacitance and energy density because of charge storage not 
only via ion adsorption but also near surface redox reactions.9-10 Therefore,
pseudocapacitive materials have been proposed to solve this concern.
Various transition metal oxides (TMOs) with pseudocapacitance properties have 
been extensively studied.4-5, 11-13 MnO2 stands out among various candidate electrode 
materials due to its natural abundant, ultrahigh theoretical specific capacitance (1370 
F g-1) and environmental compatibility. All these features make MnO2 have promising
application prospects in SCs.14-16 Our research group have prepared several special 
structures of MnO2 for SCs, for example, large basal spacing buserite-type MnO2,
17
large tunnel structure todorokite-type MnO2
18 and tetramethylammonium 
ion-intercalated MnO2.
19 Unfortunately, the inherent poor electrical conductivity of 
MnO2 lead to difficult charge transfer during charge/discharge process, resulting in a 
actual capacity much smaller than the theoretical specific capacity.14, 20 Recently, 
designing the structure of MnO2 to increase the specific surface area (SSA) or 
combining MnO2 with carbon-based materials has become the two main solutions.21-24
For example, varieties of MnO2 micro/nanostructures were fixed on porous carbon, 
graphene, carbon nanotubes, carbon fibers, and activated carbon.14, 25 Our research 
group have successfully realized the composite of MnO2 and graphene by an 
electrostatic self-assembly strategy, which greatly improved the electrochemical

improved electrochemical performance by bonding with carbon materials, the 
improvement of its conductivity is still limited.27 Therefore, substantially improving 
the electrical conductivity and supercapacitive performances of MnO2 remains a 
challenge.
Recently, hollow structures have been extensively studied and applied owing to 
their special structures, including larger surface area, good permeability and well 
internal voids, especially in electrochemical energy conversion and storage.28 MnO2
with hollow structure has also received great research attention in the area of energy 
storage. For example, the MnO2 hierarchical hollow cubes prepared by Wang et al. 
showed improved cycling stability and higher lithium storage capability than the 
MnO2 hierarchical microflowers.29 Xiao et al. reported that symmetric SCs fabricated 
using δ-MnO2 hollow microspheres electrodes exhibited remarkable cycle stability 
and rate performance.30 Guo et al. fabricated hollow MnO2 nanospheres as cathode 
materials for Zn-MnO2 batteries with stable cycling performance and large capacity.31
Combining the hollow structure with the highly conductive metal will achieve a 
synergistic effect of enhancing the electronic conductivity and supercapacitive 
performances of MnO2.
Ag has been used to improve the conductivity of various TMOs for SCs and 
lithium-ion batteries owing to its much higher conductivity than carbon materials 
(approximately 3-5 orders of magnitude) and high surface activity.4, 24, 32

high prices. In order to reduce costs, decreasing the amount of deposition is an 
effective method. More recently, the single atom, which can maximize atomic 
utilization by downsizing nanoparticles to the atomic level and promoting the 
dispersion of metals, have received intense attention. For example, Zhang et al. 
prepared single-atom Pt anchored on the MnO2 nanosheet via a hydrothermal 
approach.33 Tang et al. made silver nanoparticles highly dispersed into single-atom 
Ag chains via thermal treatment process and stabilized them on the Hollandite-type 
MnO2 nanorods.34 However, when the particle size is downsized to atomic level, due 
to its high surface energy, noble metal atoms tend to aggregate into large particles 
through Ostawald ripening. Therefore, obtaining highly dispersed single atoms is a 
huge challenge.35 Fortunately, Chen et al. proposed a redox precipitation method to 
trap and stabilize Au single atoms in surface defects of MnO2 nanorods, and found 
that the introduction of appropriate amount of Au is beneficial to the formation of 
oxygen vacancy.36 Simultaneously, defects of metal oxides can be adopted to anchor 
the single atomic metal sites by dislocations, surface disorder, vacancies and 
heterogeneity.33, 37 Especially, recent reports indicate that oxygen vacancies can serve 
as shallow donors and active sites to significantly enhance the conductivity of MnO2
and facilitate the kinetics of surface redox reactions, thereby improving its 
supercapacitive performance.8, 27, 38-39

as Ag-MnO2 HMSs) with oxygen vacancies are successfully fabricated via a

Ag-MnO2 HMSs provides a rich electrochemical active sites and large contact area 
between the active material and electrolyte, which is beneficial to mass diffusion and

itself acts as an active site but also introduces more oxygen vacancies, thus improving 
the conductivity of MnO2 HMSs as well as accelerating the redox reaction kinetics of 
charge storage at Mn and O sites, which significantly improves electrochemical 
properties. As the electrode materials for SCs, the obtained Ag-MnO2 HMSs with the

240_intro.txt.txt,"Introduction 
The contradiction between huge consumption of fossil fuel and everincreasing demand of energy draws forth the development of highefficient energy conversion and storage technologies [1–7]. Representatively, supercapacitors (SCs) and electrochemical water splitting 
(EWS) have attracted extensive research interest [8–10]. SCs possess 
great rate capability, superior power density, and long life-span, which 
enable them accessible to meet the growing demand for fast-charging 
electrochemical energy storage devices [11,12]. However, the relatively low specific capacitance (200–300 Fg− 1
) of traditional SCs (using 
carbonaceous electrode) limits their widespread application. Taking 
into account the large capacitance (~1000 Fg− 1
), various metal oxides 
used in pseudocapacitors have attracted enormous attentions recently, 
such as Co3O4 [13], MnO2 [14–16], ZnO [17], NiO [18–21], RuO2 [22], 
and Bi2MoO6 [23–27]. In addition, these metal oxides could also be 
regarded as cost-effective and efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen 
evolution reaction (OER) during the EWS process. 
Among these metal oxides, bismuth molybdate Bi2MoO6 (BMO), 
with ultra-high theoretical capacitance of 1370 Fg− 1 and large tap 
density, has been considered as a promising active material for both SCs 
and OER catalyst [28–31]. Nevertheless, the low conductivity and 
extreme overpotential caused poor cycling stability for SCs and poor 
catalytic activity for OER, respectively [32–34]. To address the issue of 
BMO, researchers develop some approaches, like morphology design, 
carbon coating, and heteroatom doping.[35–38]. For example, Wu et al. 
[39] synthesized the BMO/polyaniline nanocomposite microspheres, 
and such the composite electrode delivered a large capacitance of 826 
Fg− 1 and good capacitance retention of 75.5% (3000 cycles). On the 
other hand, electronic structure modulation of BMO via heteroatom 
doping or defects construction is conducive to enhancing the conductivity and density of active sites. Dai et al.[40] utilized cerium atoms to 
prepare the Ce-doping BMO, such the material exhibited a significant 
enhancement in catalysis capability than pristine BMO. Accordingly,

combing rational morphology with heteroatom doping is an effective 
strategy to simultaneously endow high cycling stability and catalytic 
activity. The commonly used doping method is through hydrothermal 
reaction and subsequent reductive pyrolysis, which is always accompanied with complex reaction procedure and morphological deformation. Plasma-assisted synthesis is a facile technology to achieve 
heteroatom doping and maintain pristine morphology [41]. 
Herein, the BMO nanosheet array on nickel foam was synthesized via 
one-step hydrothermal method. The NH3 plasma modification was utilized to enable synchronous nitrogen doping and oxygen vacancies on 
the surface of BMO (N-BMO) (Fig. 1a). Benefiting from the distinctive 
structure and heteroatom doping (N/O), such the N-BMO exhibited 
greatly enhanced performances in both SCs and OER process. For 
instance, the N-BMO electrode delivered more than twice capacitance 
than pristine BMO for SCs. Used in OER field, the N-BMO revealed 
enhanced catalytic activity (small Tafel slope). This work offers a potential opportunity towards cost-efficient BMO material to highperformance electrode for SCs and OER applications."

243_intro.txt.txt,"Introduction 
Supercapacitors (SCs) are power/energy storage devices employed in 
applications such as hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), security alarm systems, and 
emergency backup power sources [1]. However, commercial supercapacitors are 
heavy and occupy a huge space in electronic systems. For this reason, the experts in 
flexible electronics are developing the next generation of wearable, compact, and 
portable energy sources, which can be used for flexible displays on cell-phones, health 
tracking devices, computers, and televisions [2]. Those new generations of 
supercapacitors with novel functionalities of flexibility, portability, and high integration 
should have in ideal a superior energy (and/or power) density, electrical stability, and 
higher lifetime [3]. In fact, the technologies of printed electronics are facilitating the fast 
3 
manufacturing of very compact, environmentally friendly, and low-cost SCs [4]. Flexible 
supercapacitors are more attractive than Li-ion batteries (LIBs) because they combine 
the properties of high power density (>10 kW/kg), light-weight, short 
charging/discharging times, high cyclability, and mechanical flexibility. Also, the flexible 
SCs can be easily miniaturized for their use in wearable applications: For example, 
Cheng et al. reported Flexible planar micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) made with 
electrodes of MnO2/Ag which have a nanofiber-like structure. The devices made with 
such electrodes produced an outstanding areal capacitance of 46.6 mF/cm2
 [4]. The 
compactness and softness of the MSCs make them ideal as portable/wearable sources 
of energy. SCs can be symmetric or asymmetric: In the first case, both electrodes in the 
supercapacitor are made by the same material and it stores charge by electrochemical 
double layer mechanisms (EDL), i.e., via the reversible ions adsorption/desorption on 
the atomic interface between electrode and electrolyte [1]. In this mechanism, the 
adsorption of ions on the electrodes occurs by electrostatic attraction only. In the 
second case, the asymmetric supercapacitors consist of a battery-type Faradaic 
electrode (as the energy storage source) and a capacitor-type second electrode (as the 
power storage source), simultaneously offering the advantages of both supercapacitors 
(fast rate, cycle life) and advanced batteries (energy density) [5]. The combination of 
different electrodes in asymmetric SCs increases their operating potential window and 
their overall capacitance. Typically, the asymmetric SCs are made with carbon materials 
such as activated carbon, carbon nanotubes, and graphene because these materials 
have a very high surface area, high electrical conductivity, and high chemical stability 
[1]. In other configurations, the asymmetric SCs can utilize transition metal oxides like 
4 
ruthenium oxide (RuO2), manganese oxide (MnO2), nickel oxide (NiO), cobalt oxide 
(Co3O4) and vanadium oxide (V2O5) to produce the Faradaic redox reactions at 
electrodes [6]. Among these oxides, nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)2), has attracted attention 
due to its use in alkaline rechargeable batteries, portable electronics, and electric 
vehicles [7]. This material is also abundant, non-toxic, and can be prepared easily by 
hydrothermal, solvothermal precipitation or wet chemical methods, which produces 
several morphologies such as plates, tubes, flowers, flakes, fibers, and hollow spheres. 
This material also has a high theoretical gravimetric capacitance of 2358 F/g [8]. 
Previous reports have evaluated the capacitive properties of Ni-based electrodes. For 
example, NiO aerogels have the maximum capacitance of 901 F/g (at 0.5 A/g) and the 
capacitance retention of 93% after 3000 cycles [9] or Ni(OH)2 nanosheets, which 
reached capacitance of 2064 F/g (at 2 A/g) [10]. When these nanosheets are used to 
make an asymmetric device, a specific capacitance of 248 F/g (at 1 A/g) is obtained. 
However, the capacitance is reduced to 166 F/g after 4000 cycles of use [10]. 
Electrodes with high values of capacitance have been obtained by mixing nickel 
hydroxide and graphene, some examples here are: Ni(OH)2 nanoplates/graphene 
sheets (capacitance of ∼1335 F/g at 2.8 A/g) [11] and Ni(OH)2/graphene/nickel foam 
(2161 F/g at 3 A/g) [12]. Particularly, the asymmetric supercapacitors have used 
electrodes made with Ni(OH)2 to obtain a high performance. For example, Ni(OH)2
flowers/graphene and porous graphene have been employed to fabricate SCs with a 
maximum specific capacitance of 218.4 F/g and high energy density of 77.8 Wh/kg (this 
device retained 93% of its capacitance after 3000 cycles) [5]. Another SC employed 
Ni(OH)2 nanosheets and activated carbon as positive electrode and reached a specific 
5 
capacitance of 311 F/g at 2 A/g, [8]. Although the devices made with Ni(OH)2 have 
shown fairly high capacitance/energy density values, their capacitance values are still 
far from the theoretical value for Ni(OH)2; and this is caused by its insulating property, 
poor capacity retention, and irreversible reactions of the electrodes [13]. To overcome 
these difficulties, other groups have tried to make asymmetric supercapacitors by 
combining carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and Ni(OH)2 [14,15]. CNTs are preferred due to 
their high electrical conductivity, high surface area, interlayer distance, and capacity to 
create entangled networks with porous structures [14, 15]. For instance, CNT aerogel 
electrodes with the specific surface area of 1059 m2
/g can produce a high capacitance 
of 524 F/g [16], hierarchical α-Ni(OH)2/CNTs hybrid can reach 2325 F/g with 83.6% 
capacitance retention after 10000 cycles [17], or porous Ni(OH)2@N-doped MWCNT 
nanocomposite can produce 350 F/g (at 0.5 A/g), the energy density of ~43.75 W/kg 
and the power density of 1500 W/kg [7]. Also, it has been reported that supercapacitor 
devices made with electrodes of CNTs and/or Ni(OH)2 can reach competitive 
capacitance/energy density values. For example, Hybrid supercapacitors based on thinfilm multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) cathodes and hematite (α-Fe2O3)/MWCNT 
composite anodes, which produced the maximum capacitance of 100 F/g, the energy 
density of 50 Wh/kg and power density of 1000 W/kg [18]. Another work reported 
flexible supercapacitors made using Ni(OH)2/CNTs hierarchical spheres with high 
specific capacity (854 C/g) and energy density of 50.6 Wh/kg [19]. However, the 
Ni(OH)2/CNTs electrodes reported so far are made with complex synthesis procedures 
because they implicate the growth of Ni(OH)2 on the CNT. In the case of 
supercapacitors with electrodes made of Ni(OH)2/CNTs or hematite (α-Fe2O3)/MWCNT, 
6 
they still have low capacitance/energy density values, and this limitation is mainly due to 
the fact that they employ metal oxides with spherical morphologies of low surface area. 
Also, they utilize corrosive liquid electrolytes. 
 On the other hand, silver nanowires (Ag NWs) have been employed for the 
fabrication of transparent flexible conductive substrates for applications of flexible 
OLEDs and solar cells [20]. The main advantage of these NWs is the fact that they can 
produce substrates with low sheet resistance (5-10 Ω/□) while keeping their high optical 
transmittance (above 85%) [21]. Ag NWs have been used to create flexible all-solidstate supercapacitors based on Ag NWs/PEDOT:PSS electrodes which are able to 
produce a maximum areal capacitance of 8.58 mF/cm2
. The devices made with these 
can be bent at an angle of 180°while maintaining a capacitance retention of 90% over 
2500 cycles [22]. Similarly, Cheng et al. developed semitransparent SCs using Ag 
NWs/PEDOT:PSS grid electrodes [23]. The optimized SC devices contained 
electrodes with Ag NWs and four layers of PEDOT:PSS. This device reached maximum 
capacitance of 1.84 mF/cm2
 but it is 56% lower (1.18 mF/cm2
) if the electrodes are 
made only with four layers of PEDOT:PSS [24] (i.e. without AgNW). This 
semitransparent device also had capacitance retention of 83.7% after 5000 cycles of 
charge/discharge. Moreover, Liu et al. employed ultralong Ag NWs with average length 
of 75 µm to make transparent and conductive electrodes, which were employed to make 
transparent solid state SCs [25]. These devices presented a maximum areal 
capacitance of 0.9 mF/cm2
 for the first cycle of charge/discharge, but it was reduced by 
25% after bending the devices 100 times and decreased by 15% after 5000 cycles of 
charge/discharge. Those characteristics of bendability, flexibility, and transparency of 
7 
Ag-based SCs make them suitable for wearable applications. The Ag NWs and Ni(OH)2
have also been deposited on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates to make 
flexible electrode composites able to reach maximum capacitance of 1165 F/g (at 3A/g) 
[26]. These electrodes maintained capacitance retention of 93% after 3000 cycles. 
Furthermore, AgNW/MoO2 nanocomposite supercapacitor electrodes demonstrated a 
specific capacitance of 500.7 F/g (at 0.25 A/g) and a capacitance retention above 80% 
after 5000 cycles [27]. The capacitive performance of the Ag NWs based electrodes 
was enhanced because the simultaneous presence of Ag NWs and the Ni(OH)2 
facilitated both the ion and electron transport. Moreover, the presence of the Ag NWs 
decreased the sheet resistance of the electrodes without reducing the optical 
transmittance [27]. Additionally, solid state supercapacitors with AgNWs/Ni(OH)2 as 
anode and Al foil as cathode have been reported; these devices had a maximum 
capacitance of 167 F/g and a capacitance retention of ≈45% after 1500 cycles [28]. In 
general, all the electrode/SC-devices mentioned above made of CNTs, AgNWs, Ni(OH)2 
or combinations of these materials, still have the following problems: 1) Similar 
charge/discharging times, i.e., the charging time is equal or almost equal to the 
discharging times; 2) Their discharging times are in the range of 1–150 min (limiting 
their use as constant source of energy); 3) In particular, the solid state SCs showed 
maximum capacitances and energy density values below 200 F/g and 100 Wh/Kg, 
respectively. The low energy density of these devices reduces their competitiveness 
with respect to commercial Li ion batteries, which have energy density values of 260–
500 Wh/Kg [29]; and 4) All these devices or electrodes are not transparent during their 
8 
operation. Due to these disadvantages, flexible solid state devices that employ 
simultaneously CNTs, Ag NWs, and Ni(OH)2 are still a matter of research. 
 Adding the optical transparency property to flexible supercapacitors could be a 
valuable characteristic for opening other types of applications or saving space. For 
example, flexible transparent SCs could be attached on windows; this would save 
space to keep the energy storage device while allowing light to pass into the house. As 
an effort to add the transparency property to the SCs and to increase the performance 
of the previous CNT based SCs, we fabricated SCs with electrodes (anodes) made with 
CNT sheets previously developed by the group of R. Baughman et al. [30] These dryspinable CNTs sheets behave like a textile and can be easily transferred manually to 
any soft plastic substrate by simple lamination process. To increase the conductivity of 
CNT electrodes while keeping a high transparency, we added Ag NWs to the CNT 
electrodes, and to enhance the Faradaic capacitive properties, we added Ni(OH)2 NWs 
to the CNT/Ag NWs electrode. The simultaneous use of the three materials—CNTs, Ag 
NWs, and Ni(OH)2—to make flexible solid state supercapacitors has not been reported 
to the best of our knowledge. The main novelties of our work are: i) our flexible SCs are 
semi-transparent with an average transmittance of 46% in the VIS range (400-800 nm), 
ii) they produce maximum capacitance and energy density values of 888.6 F/g and 
177.3 Wh/kg, which is superior to any reported value for flexible hybrid SCs based on 
CNTs, Ag NWs, Ni(OH)2 or their combinations, and iii) the assymetric SCs made with 
anodes of CNT/Ag NWs/Ni(OH)2 presented a constant voltage of ≈1.2 V for at least 10 
h, which has not been observed to the best of our knowledge in CNT or Ni(OH)2 based 
SCs. Due to all this new characteristics of our flexible state SCs mentioned, we believe 
9 
that they could be good candidates for applications of energy/power storage in houses, 
solar cells, and portable devices. "
244_intro.txt.txt,". Introduction
Supercapacitors or ultracapacitors are next generation are considered to be the most promising 
candidate in the current energy scenario, bridging the gap between conventional capacitors and 
Li ion batteries in terms of energy and power performance.
1-3 Moreover, the long cycling 
stability along with wide operation temperature range and the usage of non-toxic, safer materials 
makes supercapacitors as potential candidates in different areas including hybrid electric 
vehicles, electronic devices, memory backup systems, energy harvesting etc.4-5 The conventional 
Electric Double Layer Capacitors (EDLC) have recently paved their way for pseudocapacitors 
and hybrid capacitors in an attempt to enhance the energy density.6-7 The pseudocapacitive 
mechanisms can be of different types, all of which involving the change in oxidation state of the 
transition metal oxide involved. The most established mechanism is the adsorption/desorption of 
ions from the electrolyte on the electrode surface.7
 The second one relies on the redox reactions 
taking place at the surface of the electrode overlay and the third mode of pseudocapacitive 
charge storage is based on the reversible intercalation of ions into the bulk of the material.8-9
Apart from these, some of the recent literatures have explored the role of cation and anion 
vacancies for charge storage. For example, Hahn et al. demonstrated the possibilities of 
enhancing electrochemical charge storage with cation vacancies in MnO2, through cation 
insertion into Mn vacancies.10 However, there are few studies in which materials with inherent 
anion vacancies are exploited except the works done on perovskite structures by Mefford et al. 
and Chen et al. However, the perovskites often suffer from decomposition under heat moisture 
and snow which is a serious disadvantage for energy storage applications.11-12
. Hence, it would 
be highly advantageous if we can select a suitable metal oxide system with inherent anion 
vacancies for pseudocapacitive applications. 
Rare earth metal oxides are widely used as pseudocapacitor electrodes due to their multiple 
oxidation states and high electrical conductivity.13-17 Praseodymium oxides are regarded as one 
of the excellent rare earth metal oxides due to its striking electrochemical as well as optical 
properties originating from the 4f shell of electrons. Exceptionally high electron conductivity 
was exhibited by oxides of praseodymium (σ =7.6 µS/cm at 60 °C) due to the electron hopping 
between mixed metal ion valance states of the lattice.
18-19 The oxides of praseodymium represent 
a system of different phases and exhibit highest oxygen ion mobility within the series of 
lanthanide oxides, because of this wide range of stable phases enabling rapid changes in the 
oxidation state of praseodymium.20 Moreover, the work function of Pr6O11 is as low as 2.8 eV 
which makes it feasible to design a high voltage pseudocapacitor system when coupled with a 
high work function material like MoO3 or V2O5, since work function of a faradaic material is a 
significant factor in determining the operating voltage of asymmetric pseudocapacitors (Equation 
1 and schematic illustration shown in Fig. 1).

. Irrespective of all these advantages Pr6O11 has rarely been reported as a potential 
pseudocapacitor electrode and the electrochemical properties of the system has been explored in 
only very few articles. For e.g., Hassen and coworkers synthesized Pr6O11 by simple 
precipitation method and analysed the electrochemical properties.25 According to Huggins, an ion 
intercalation mechanism is possible in Pr6O11 in aqueous systems, which is operated by a proton 
replacement redox reaction.26 With these remarks, the present study reports the pseudocapacitive 
properties of PrOx as anode material. In order to further improve the conductivity of PrOx, an in-
situ hydrothermal approach is adopted for the synthesis of a PrOx/unzipped multi-walled carbon 
nanotube (UZCNT) composite which shows better electrochemical properties. 
Fig.1 Schematic illustration of work functions of different metal oxides. 
An asymmetric supercapacitor was also designed and fabricated by introducing PrOx
/UZCNT as the anode and a V2O5/graphene composite as the cathode with a KOH-PVA polymer 
gel as the electrolyte. V2O5 is an intercalation compound that has high energy density and a 
widely used pseudocapacitor electrode material with its outstanding properties along with low 
cost and easiness in fabrication."

246_intro.txt.txt,"Introduction 
Supercapacitors (SCs), as a critical member of energy storage devices, have been widely used in 
hybrid electric vehicles and consumer electronics due to their high power density and stable cycling 
properties.1-3 Based on their energy storage mechanism, SCs can be classified into electrical 
double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) and pseudocapacitors.
4
 EDLCs employ carbon-based materials 
such as activated carbon,5
 graphene,6-9 carbon nanotube,10-12 etc. as active material and the store 
energy is via separating charges at the electrode-electrolyte interface, which suffer from the lower 
energy density. While pseudocapacitors utilize transition metal oxides such as NiO,13-15 MoO3,
16-18
Co3O4,
19-21 MnO2,
22-25 etc. and conducting polymers26-27 as the active material, charge store is 
realized by fast Faradaic reactions. In comparison with EDLCs, pseudocapacitors can effectively 
overcome the bottleneck of the low density and thus draw tremendous attentions.28-30
Among the above transition-metal-oxide active materials for pseudocapacitors, MnO2 shows 
significant predominance because of the abundant resources, the environment amity, and the high 
theoretical capacitance (1380 F g-1).31 More importantly, it provides a wider potential window in 
neutral aqueous electrolytes, which can result in higher energy density.32, 33 However, its relatively 
low ionic conductivity, ∼10-13 S cm-1 and electrical conductivity ∼10-5 -10-6 S cm-1 have greatly 
limited its intrinsic capacitive properties. This leads to the measured capacitance values of MnO2
much lower than the theoretical ones.34-35 To improve the conductivity and the capacitance 
characteristics of MnO2, numerous efforts have been afforded. One strategy is to increase the 
surface area. So some specially-designed MnO2 nanostructures36, such as nanoparticles,37
nanosheets,38 nanorods,39 nanowires,40 nanoflowers,41 nanoneedles,42 and hollow spheres43 have 
been studied intensively. The other strategy is to combine MnO2 with the other highly conductive 
materials like carbon-based materials,44-47 transition metals or noble metals48-50 to form the hybrid 
MnO2-based composites. Unfortunately, due to the poor intrinsic conductivity of MnO2 and the 
restriction of the MnO2/conductor interfaces, the conductivity enhancement of MnO2-based 
composites by this external conductive reinforcement is still limited. 
Recently, the introduction of oxygen vacancies on MnO2 surface is regarded as an 
effective way to tune its electron struture.51-53 The introduction of oxygen vacancies can 
transform MnO2 from the poor conductor into the half-metallic.53,54 Moreover, the existence 
of oxygen vacancies can provide the additional ion intercalation sites and promote the 
surface redox reaction kinetics, which leads to the improved electrochemical capacitance 
performance.35 Thus, how to introduce the oxygen vacancies has received tremendous 
attentions in the academic community. For example, Zhai et al.
55 reported oxygen-deficient 
MnO2 nanorods prepared by hydrogenation treatment and the obtained area capacitance was 
0.22 F cm-2 @0.75 mA cm-2. Fu et al.
51 developed oxygen-deficient MnO2@MnO2
yolk-shell microspheres prepared by similar method and the capacitance was 452.4 F g-1 @ 
1 A g-1 under a small amount of mass loading. While these reported methods are complex, 
time- and energy- consuming, which seriously block the mass production. Thus, it is still 
urgent to seek for a facile, economic and scalable method to fabricate high performance 
oxygen-deficient MnO2. 
Based on the above mentioned research progress, it is a great challenge to facilely prepare 
oxygen-deficient nanostructured MnO2 with intensified surface area and enhanced conductivity 
simultaneously. In this paper, we developed a simple, template-free, one-pot synthesis method of 
MnO2 nanostructure with adjustable oxygen vacancies, in which KMnO4 is used as the metal source 
and glucose functions as both the reductant and the structure-directing agent. Meanwhile, the 
reaction temperature was manipulated to control the morphology and oxygen vacancy content of the 
products, both of which play key roles in determining the final electrochemical performances. In 
addition, the oxygen-deficient MnO2 prepared at 60 ℃ exhibits the largest specific area and the 
highest conductivity, which overall contribute to the optimal electrochemical performance, 
including high specific capacitance, rate performance and excellent cycling stability. Our work 
promotes the development of the supercapacitors based on oxygen-deficient MnO2."
247_intro.txt.txt,"Introduction 
The technological innovation and mass manufacturing of numerous 
electronic devices such as televisions, smartphones, laptops, and computers have made the life easier for countless people around the world. 
However, the generation of waste caused by all these electronic devices 
has become a serious world problem and such waste is known as electronic waste (e-waste) [1]. It is reported that 53.6 million tons of e-waste 
were generated in 2020 and a current estimation indicates that it will 
grow by 40% more by 2030. Currently the main processes for the 
treatment of this type of waste are incineration, gasification, pyrolysis, 
and anaerobic digestion. Nevertheless, none of them is a sustainable and 
environmentally friendly process [2]. In order to solve the problem of 
e-waste generation and to reduce environmental impact, researchers 
have focused their efforts to find alternatives for the development of 
ecological, sustainable and biodegradable electronic devices and at least 
one of their components (substrates, electrodes, electrolytes or active 
layers) should be biodegradable [3,4]. Some examples of electronic 
devices that currently efficient but not biodegradable are the solar cells, 
OFETs, LEDs, sensors, batteries and supercapacitors [3]. Besides, the 
electrochemical supercapacitors (SCs) are devices that store energy by 
electric double layer (EDL) and faradaic redox reactions [5]. These devices are of great interest they possess outstanding charge-storage 
capability, low charging time, high cycling stability, light weight, and 
can be flexible or stretchable. Those characteristics make them suitable 
for portable and wearable electronic applications [6]. Thus, the SCs are

promising to be consumed and employed in mass scale. 
Recently, researchers have published novel nanocomposites or core/ 
shell nanostructures to favor the redox reactions and to improve the 
specific capacitance (Cs) and energy density (Ed) of solid state SCs. For 
example: hollow MnFe2O4 nanocubes assembled by CoS2 nanosheets (Cs 
= 894 C g− 1 and Ed = 63.75 Wh kg− 1
) [7], hollow α-MnS@Co3S4 spheres 
(Cs = 1019.9 C g− 1 and Ed = 54.9 Wh kg− 1
) [8], copper-cobalt selenide 
hollow spheres (Cs = 1775.4 F g− 1 and Ed = 53.86 Wh kg− 1
) [9], 
multi-shelled nickel–manganese selenide hollow spheres (Cs = 1221.1 C 
g− 1 and Ed = 112.6 Wh kg− 1
) [10], roselike nanoporous ZnGa2S4 hollow 
spheres (Cs = 358.4 mAh g− 1 and Ed = 72.78 Wh kg− 1
) [11], nanoporous 
CuCoNi–P nanotube arrays (Cs = 406.73 mAh g− 1 and Ed = 153.5 Wh 
kg− 1
) [12], yolk-shell Cu–Co–P hollow nanospheres (Cs = 2043.3 F g− 1 
(340.55 mAh g− 1
) and Ed = 158.4 Wh kg− 1
) [13]. Although these materials above have high electrochemical performance, nanocomposites 
containing graphene have also emerged to improve the conductivity and 
cycling stability of the supercapacitor electrodes. Among the most 
relevant materials, we found: multi-shelled zinc-cobalt selenide hollow 
nanospheres/graphene (Cs = 376.75 mAh g− 1 and Ed = 126.3 Wh kg− 1
) 
[14], graphene wrapped yolk-double shell NiGa2S4 hollow microspheres 
(Cs = 2868.4 F g− 1 and Ed = 158.53 Wh kg− 1
) [15], graphene wrapped 
multi-shelled NiGa2O4 hollow sphere (Cs = 411.25 mAh g− 1 and Ed =
118.97 Wh kg− 1
) [16] and graphene wrapped CuFeS2 hollow spheres 
(Cs = 1724.30 F g− 1 (239.5 mAh g− 1
) and Ed = 114.8 Wh kg− 1
) [17]. 
Finally, nanostructures containing activated carbon have been developed to improve the capacities/energy densities of electrode materials 
such as: rugby-ball-like NiCo2Se4 yolk–shell nanostructures (Cs = 258.1 
mAh g− 1 and Ed = 56.9 Wh kg− 1
) [18] and hierarchical NiCoSe2@NiMn-LDH (Cs = 401.7 mAh g− 1 and Ed = 47.0 Wh kg− 1
) [19]. 
Due to the relevance of the SCs and to avoid future contamination of 
the environment by plastic components (as traditionally used by the 
electronics industry in SCs), it has been developed in recent years novel 
biodegradable SCs. For example, Wang et al. [20] built a device using 
completely edible materials and tested the operation of the SC by supplying enough voltage and current to turn on an LED. The materials used 
to make the SCs were cheese, gold leaf, activated charcoal, seaweed, and 
Gatorade as the substrate, current collector, electrode, separator, and 
electrolyte, respectively. The edible SC presented a capacitance and 
energy density of 78.8 F g− 1 (at 1 A g− 1
) and 10.0 Wh kg− 1
, respectively. 
Furthermore, Moon et al. [21] studied a biodegradable gel electrolyte, 
which was made by mixing NaCl and agarose. The SC that employed 
such biodegradable electrolyte presented specific capacitance of 286.9 
F g− 1 and energy density of 20 Wh kg− 1 (at 100 mV s
− 1
). In addition, this 
new biodegradable electrolyte is cheaper, safer, nontoxic and scalable 
compared with the current electrolytes in the market as H3PO4, H2SO4, 
LiCl, LiClO4 and others. Also, Chen et al. [22] developed biodegradables 
electrodes fabricated with activated wood carbon and the separator was 
a thin wood membrane. This SC showed a specific capacitance and energy density of 35.6 F g− 1 (at 1 mA cm− 2
) and 16 Wh kg− 1
. Based on the 
discussion above, we infer that the current biodegradable SCs have low 
capacitance values. In order to improve the capacity to store charge in 
the SC, the scientists have introduced perovskites which have high 
chemical and thermal stability, high content of oxygen vacancies and 
good electric conductivity (30–60 S/cm) at room temperature [23]. 
Some works related with SCs made of perovskites include: Mefford et al. 
[24] reported a SC electrode made of LaMnO3 perovskite and exhibited a 
capacitance and energy density of 609.8 F g− 1 and 23.4 Wh kg− 1 (at 100

simple and scalable method to synthesize the LaMnO3-δ perovskite, this 
electrode generated a maximum capacitance of 973.5 F g− 1 (at 1 A g− 1
) 
in 6 M KOH and a capacitance retention of 32% after 5000 cycles of 
charge/discharge. Moreover, Elsiddig et al. [26] reported the electrochemical properties of the LaMnO3-δ/N-doped rGO composite electrode 
and this had specific capacitance of 687 F g− 1 (at 1 A g− 1
) and a 
capacitance retention of 79% after 2000 cycles of charge/discharge. 
Then, this last work demonstrates that the electrochemical properties of 
the perovskite materials improve after combining them with graphene. 
In general, the perovskites contains oxygen vacancy defects, which are 
produced after doping them with elements such as Sr, Cu and Co and 
these helps to enhance the capacitance of the perovskites [27,28]. 
Despite the high capacitance exhibited by the perovskites materials, 
they still present low cycling stability and the high capacitances are 
obtained when they are evaluated in acid/basic compounds such as KOH 
or H2SO4. Additionally, most of publications report the performance of 
perovskite electrodes, but it is actually needed solid state SCs made with 
such perovskites due to their low cost and high redox activity. Therefore, 
finding new configurations of solid states SCs containing perovskites is 
still matter of investigation. 
A simple, low-cost and environmentally friendly supercapacitor was 
developed in this research. We used the avocado peel as a biodegradable 
support to construct the supercapacitor electrodes, and we estimate that 
≈98% of the mass of the SC was biodegradable. This waste is abundantly 
produced in Mexico because the avocado is widely employed in the 
Mexican gastronomy and it is combined with plenty dishes in Mexico. To 
the best of our knowledge, most of flexible supercapacitors employ nonbiodegradable polymers such as polyimide and polyethylene terephtalate (PET) [29,30]. Thus, the use of biodegradable electrodes 
avoids the contamination by plastics in the environment when they are 
disposed at the end of their lifetime. To construct the biodegradable SC, 
the avocado (AV) peel was coated by a graphene-ink to make it electrically conductive. Later, this biodegradable and conductive electrode 
was coated by the redox perovskite of LaMnO3 (LM) or LaSrMnO3 (LSM) 
and two of those electrodes were assembled in sandwich configuration 
to finally construct the SC electrode. Our work presents several novelties: 1) the biodegradable avocado peel is used for the first time to 
construct flexible and biodegradable SCs, 2) we studied the effect of the 
Sr doped LaMnO3 on the electrochemical properties of flexible graphene 
SCs, which has not been reported previously and 3) the maximum values 
of capacitance and energy density of 1100.85 F g− 1 and 495.83 Wh kg− 1 
are superior to the previous reported values for flexible and biodegradable SCs. In general, the results of this work demonstrate that using 
the LM host doped with Sr into the supercapacitors improved the 
capacitance and energy density by 56% (in comparison with the SC 
containing LM without Sr). In addition, the devices made with LM and 
LSM presented for 10 h a stable/constant output voltage of 0.88 and 
1.42 V, respectively. This suggests that the SC is firstly releasing the 
energy stored capacitively and later, redox reactions are produced to 
maintain such constant operating voltage. The devices were also 
exposed to 500 bending cycles and the capacitance diminished only by 
11.5% in the SCs containing LSM, while the devices made with the LM 
synthesized without Sr dopant suffered a loss of 22.4% of their initial 
capacitance after the same amount of bending cycles. Thus, the results 
presented here suggest that the avocado based SC could be a feasible 
option of environmentally friendly energy storage device and could pave 
the way for the creation of novel "

The synthesis and characterization of cerium dioxide (CeO2) thin
films have attracted considerable attention by researchers due to
their useful applications in the materials science and technology
fields, especially energy storage devices, including super capacitors,
i.e., electrical double layer capacitors (EDLC) and pseudo-capacitors.1
In the EDLC, electrostatic charges accumulate well at the electrolyte/
electrode interface; this is the origin of the capacitance, but for
pseudo-capacitors, the capacity results from a fast
oxidationereduction reaction of the material at the level of the
surface such as sulphides and oxides metals as well as conductive
polymers.2,3 For super capacitor applications, the lanthanide series
elements are frequently used as a more intensive study to examine
their usefulness as new elements. Among the lanthanides, we find
cerium (Ce) as the most suitable candidate due to its non-toxic
character for the environment.4 Due to properties that include a
large band gap (3.2 eV), high conductivity, good transparency,
excellent redox properties and high stability, CeO2 is regarded as a
potential electrode material for high output supercapacitors.
Furthermore, the oxidation degree of Ce can change rapidly between
Ce (III) and Ce (IV), leading to its use in different superconducting
zones.5 If CeO2 is applied in electrochromic devices, it has stable
transmittance in the oxidized and reduced states as well as high
transmittance in the visible and near infrared regions.6 CeO2-doped
oxides are able to easily create oxygen vacancies, in which case Ce4þ
ions are reduced to Ce3þ, this property gives oxygen storage capacity
in the CeO2 lattice. Therefore, this result increases the conductive

properties of the oxide. The doping process of transition metal ions
like Mn, Ni, Fe and Co can lead to an improvement of the surface
properties of nanocomposite materials by decreasing the increase of
crystallites which stops the agglomeration of particles. This behavior
can result in a very efficient manner to improve the electrochemical
capacity during the charge/discharge operation.3 In electrochromic
devices (ECDs), CeO2 is employed as an optically passive (ion storage
layers) counter electrode due to its high optical transmittance and
excellent ability to insert/extract of Liþ in the reduced and oxidized
states in the visible region.7,8 In addition, CeO2 films have several
very useful utilities namely, energy storage materials,9 catalysts,10
photocatalysis,11 solid solutions,12 optoelectronics, UV photodetectors,13 gas sensors,14 supercapacitor,15e18 as well as being used as
counter electrodes in smart window devices.19,20 As regards supercapacitors, RuO2 oxide is seen as the best electrode material,
although its applications are hampered by its high cost and poor
availability, while the oxides MnO2, NiO and Co3O4 were also
investigated as alternative electrode materials to RuO2
1
. Several
techniques were investigated to elaborate the CeO2 thin films, such
as magnetron sputtering,21 spray pyrolysis technique,22,23 electrochemical deposition,24 solegel,25 hydrothermal method26 and
pulsed laser deposition.27 There are three successive steps to produce a material using the spray technique, after atomisation of a
liquid precursor which contains metal salts into droplets, the latter
move towards a heated substrate and the formation of a film occurs,
finally, evaporation of the solvent and decomposition of the deposited material takes place.28 Under ambient pressure, this technique
provides great flexibility with respect to material composition and is
a useful method for the deposition of a wide variety of thin films
since the addition of dopants to the sputtering solution is straight
forward; it is easy to prepare films of any composition by simply
mixing the components in the appropriate proportions.29
The novelty of this work consists of the investigation and
development of manganese-doped CeO2 thin films for the application as supercapacitors by using spray pyrolysis technique. To our
knowledge, elaborating the manganese-doped CeO2 thin films by
the spray pyrolysis method has rarely been done from the point of
view of studying the supercapacitors. Therefore, the spray pyrolysis
technique increases the material surface, which leads to increasing
storage capacity and redox behavior. Undoped and doped CeO2
elaborated thin films with different concentrations (2 wt%, 4 wt%,
and 6 wt%) of manganese were studied using varying techniques
such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, UVeVis
spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis, energy
dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of thin films
Hydrated cerium chloride (CeCl3$7H2O, purity 99.5 wt%) and
hydrated manganese chloride (MnCl2,4H2O, purity 99 wt%) were
purchased from Sigma Aldrich and used without additional purification. Undoped and Mn doped Ce1exMnxO2 thin films were
elaborated by using sputter pyrolysis technique on glass substrate
at 450 ± 10 C. The precursor solution was prepared by dissolving
an appropriate quantity of CeCl3$7H2O in 50 mL of bidistilled water
at 298 K with a concentration of 0.05 mol/L. Then, we added a very
large amount of dilute HCl to increase the solubility of the reagents
in the solution and to remove any hydroxides that might form (the
solution should be very transparent). The oxidation reaction is as
follows:
CeCl3 þ O2!Ts CeO2 þ

2 Cl2 (1)
Further, the precursor MnCl2$4H2O was used as a dopant for the
Ce1exMnxO2 matrix. The molar concentrations of manganese used
in the doped films were 2 wt%, 4 wt%, and 6 wt%. The pH of the
finally obtained solution was 2.23. Film deposition was carried out
by using Holmarc spray pyrolysis unit (HO-TH-04, Kerala, India).
During deposition, the spray nozzle distance, the flow rate of the
solution and the spray time were 26 cm, 3 mL/min and 8 min,
respectively. Then, the compressed air flow rate was 6 L/min. The
sprayed aqueous solution was decomposed on the hot substrate,
resulting in the formation of thin layers of high quality for undoped
and Mn doped Ce1exMnxO2 matrix.
2.2. Characterization techniques
Undoped and Mn doped Ce1exMnxO2 thin films were characterized and confirmed using the Brucker X-ray diffractometer technique
(Cu radiation Ka, wavelength l ¼ 0.15406 nm operating at 45 kV of
the tube voltage, current of 40 mA and 2q from 15 to 90). Further,
thin film structures were analyzed by Oriba Raman spectroscopy
(633 nm incident laser source). Then, the morphology surface for
thin films were examined and investigated using atomic force microscopy (AFM) technique. A scanning electron microscope (Quattro
ESEM) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray (EDS) detector was
used. The optical properties were realized using the SHIMADZUUVVis-NIR spectrophotometer. Also, electrochemical behaviors were
performed using a Volta Lab system (VM4) apparatus. Electrochemical cell was composed on three electrodes namely ITO as a
work electrode, platinum sheet as a counter electrode and saturated
calomel electrode (SCE) as a reference electrode, respectively."

The energy crisis caused by the excessive consumption of
traditional energy sources and the additional environmental
pollution problems force human beings to turn their attention
to alternative unconventional energy sources.1,2 The tapping of
energy from reproducible sources needs an efficient energy
storage system, which can cater the requirement of continual
power. Batteries had become the mainstream of energy storage
equipment for centuries since they were invented, but in recent
years, people have realized the importance of developing highpower energy storage devices, which have been a landmark in
transportation, biomedicine, and several other fields.3−7 These
energy storage devices such as supercapacitors,8 Li- and K-ion
batteries,9 Al−air batteries10 can effectively store and supply
renewable energy, thereby paving ways for significant reduction
in environmental pollution that plague the current society.
Supercapacitors offer comprehensive and superior electrochemical performance11−13 and are regarded as an emerging
“dream energy system”, which have shown great application
prospects in many fields. The electrode materials can
determine the performance of supercapacitors, so the
preparation of high-performance electrode materials is still a
hot research topic.
Transition metal oxide-based electrode materials have been
extensively studied due to their high theoretical capacity, fast
charge and discharge speed, small structural deformation, and
low cost.14−18 Recently, nickel−cobalt bimetal oxides have
attracted the attention of many scholars to meet the
application of high-power supercapacitors. Lu’s group has

capacitive performance of around 50% compared to cobalt
oxide.19 On the basis of previous research, the preparation
method of metal oxides is closely related to the performance of
the device. In particular, porous oxide materials have
significantly improved the performance of capacitor devices.20
Therefore, it is necessary to further explore a simple and
effective preparation strategy for porous oxides electrode
materials. Metal−organic frameworks (MOFs) have been
deeply studied as promising candidate materials for the
preparation of porous metal oxides.21−23 Porous metal oxides
prepared by MOFs are beneficial to reduce lattice distortion,
thereby improving the capacity and cycle stability of supercapacitors.14,24 Among various MOF materials,25 the aminofunctionalized MOFs with basic amino groups have not been
studied much for supercapacitor application.26,27
Recently, it has been reported that the increase in
conductivity and specific capacitance of metal oxides can be
provided by surface functionalization or the introduction of
oxygen vacancies.28−31 The introduction of oxygen vacancies
can increase the energy capacity by increasing reaction sites,
accelerating ion transfer, delaying structural deformation, and
reducing the energy barrier during repeated insertion/
extraction.29,32 The introduction of oxygen vacancies also
effectively increases the pseudocapacitance coefficient. Oxygen
vacancies can accelerate the electron/ion transport and
increase the oxygen supply, and therefore, they have an
important research value in the field of electrochemistry.28
There are many ways to introduce oxygen vacancies, including
NaBH4 treatment and H2O2 treatment. Among them, oxygen
vacancy oxides can also be synthesized by simply annealing in
air. For example, Cao et al. fabricated oxygen vacancy-rich
NiCo2O4 with poor crystallinity on NF substrates via the
annealing approach.31
Herein, we design a simple hydrothermal method to directly
grow binder-free amino-functionalized MOF rhombus slice
(NH2-NiCo MOF RS) nanosheet arrays on nickel foam (NF)
substrates and then prepare oxygen vacancy-containing metal
oxide arrays (NixCo3−xO4/NF) by in situ oxidation. By simply
calcining in the air, the layered NH2-NiCo MOF RS/NF is
completely transformed into a bimetal oxide nanosheet array
with oxygen vacancies. The prepared NixCo3−xO4/NF not only
retains the rhombic-shaped flake morphology of the precursor
but also exfoliates into thinner nanosheets. The unique
structure provides a larger active area and electron transmission path, which improves the electrochemical properties.33
Furthermore, the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC)
shows high energy density, power density, and long cycle life
(97.7% of capacitance after 10000 cycles). These results show
that the prepared bimetal oxide array has considerable
potential in future practical application."

the properties of the Faradic battery-type electrode materials.6-8,10 Thus, the rational design and fabrication of
highly electroactive electrode materials are essential for
attaining high-performance HSCs with the desirable ED
and PD.6,10-12
Among the binary metal oxides, nickel molybdate
(NiMoO4) is an attractive electrode material due to its
large theoretical capacity, the existence of multiple oxidation states, abundance, low cost, and environmentally
benign nature.13,14 Despite these merits, the poor electrical conductivity and inadequate electroactive sites
severely hinder its widespread application to become a
high-performance electrode material for HSCs.14 Therefore, the advancement of novel strategies is essentially
required to boost the electrochemical properties of the
electrode materials that enable its inherent features.6,15,16 To address this matter, tremendous research
efforts have been dedicated to tailoring nanostructured
material with the desirable architecture and introducing
defective engineering, which is a promising approach to
manipulate the chemical activities and electrical properties to a higher degree.10,17,18 Significantly, the generation
of oxygen vacancy in the metal oxide material can serve as
an electronic charge carrier. Furthermore, it could expedite the electrical conductivity, reaction kinetics, and electroactive sites of the electrode materials.13,19 For instance,

vacancies such as CoMoO4 and Fe2O3 nanoplate arrays,15

With the strong demand for portable and wearable electronic
devices, flexible energy storage systems such as flexible microsupercapacitors (MSCs), have attracted enormous attention in recent years [1]. To date, considerable efforts have been made to
develop high-performance MSCs based on various electrode materials, including carbon nanomaterials [2,3], conducting polymers
[4,5] and metallic oxides [6–9]. The perovskite oxides with unique
physical and electrical properties, have shown extensive application prospects in electronics [10], piezoelectrics [11], catalysis [12] and energy storage [13–15]. For instance, the Mn-doped
Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3-BaTiO3-BiFeO3 [13] and Ba(Zr0.2Ti0.8)O3 [14] have
been used for dielectric film capacitors with ultrahigh recoverable

gen ions under electrical polarization, reflecting the unique structural stability [15]. The charge storage mechanism of LaMnO3 depends on the rapid migration of OH− and O2− anions in crystal lattice, which can account for oxygen-vacancy-mediated intercalation pseudocapacitance [15]. Based on reversible redox reaction of metal ions, bismuth ferrite (BiFeO3) as a typical ABO3-type
perovskite oxide, exhibits the outstanding energy storage performances of high specific capacity and wide voltage window, but
poor rate capability and bad cycling stability, due to its denselypacked crystal structure and multi-electron redox reaction kinetics,
to the disadvantage of electrolyte ion diffusion and charge transfer
[16].
According to the essential differences of energy storage mechanisms between supercapacitors and batteries [17], the capacitive electrode materials depend on electric double layer capacitance, surface redox pseudocapacitance and intercalation pseudocapacitance [18]. Specifically, the intercalation pseudocapacitance
mechanism is based on fast Faraday reactions through the rapid
intercalation/de-intercalation of electrolyte ions into active electrodes. This reversible process without phase transformation, is

beneficial to develop high-rate long-life electrode materials based
on metal oxides or sulfides for electrochemical energy storage,
such as T-Nb2O5 [19], VO2 [20], VS2 [21], ZnxCo1-xO [22].
The rational regulation of oxygen vacancy defects can play an
important role in improving ion transport properties for the enhancement of the rate capability and ion intercalation pseudocapacitance of BiFeO3. As a rule, oxygen vacancies can be introduced
into ABO3 perovskite oxides through cation substitutions and ion
non-stoichiometry [12]. Among these routes, aliovalent cation substitution of B site is usually considered as one of the most effective methods for creating oxygen vacancy defects. For the aliovalent ion doping of BiFeO3, partial substitution of Fe3+ ions with
a low-valence transition metal ion (such as Cu2+) will lead to the
rise of valence states for B site or the emergence of oxygen vacancies, which can be formed by releasing lattice oxygen to maintain
the charge neutrality [23]. Additionally, partial substitution of Fe3+
ions with a high-valence transition metal ion (such as Ru4+, Nb5+,
V5+) will reduce the valence states of B site or suppress the formation of oxygen vacancies, attributed to the charge compensation
mechanism [24–26]. The V5+ ion is suitable for the cation substitution of B site in BiFeO3, attributed to its comparative ionic radius of 0.54 A˚ to that of Fe3+ ion (0.64 A). ˚ Moreover, the V-doped
BiFeO3 (BiFe1-xVxO3) can be concluded to show a higher Gibbs free
energy than that of BiFeO3 at pH 7 under the operating voltage
of about 1.5 V [27], indicating its excellent electrochemical stability in consecutive charge/discharge process. At present, the study
on the V doping of BiFeO3 or Bi25FeO40 is mainly confined to the
utilization of V5+ doping to improve the magnetic or photocatalytic properties [26,28]. For instance, the Sr2+ and V5+ co-doped
BiFeO3 can be fabricated through the solid state reaction to greatly
enhance the remnant magnetization and coercive field [26]. The
V-doped Bi25FeO40 has been prepared by the facile hydrothermal
method and demonstrated as a great system to regulate the photocatalytic activities through the reasonable design of the band structure and morphologies, which can be precisely tuned by different
V concentrations [28]. However, the pure crystalline BiFeO3 usually requires rigorous reaction conditions or even a cumbersome
post-processing process, such as annealing process [29–31], which
severely prevents the utilization of BiFeO3 as a type of high-energy
electrode materials for flexible MSC devices. Moreover, it is really
a huge challenge to manifest the effects of V doping on improving
the rate capability and ion intercalation pseudocapacitance of the
BiFeO3-based electrodes.
Herein, we propose the electrochemical charge/discharge process to induce the formation of the crystalline BiFeO3 named the
cycled BiFe1-xVxO3 (c-BiFe1-xVxO3) without annealing, which can
be derived from the original BiFe1-xVxO3 (o-BiFe1-xVxO3) obtained
by electrochemical deposition (ED). Through adjusting the V doping content, the structure and morphology of o-BiFe1-xVxO3 can be
controlled, in order to obtain the stable o-BiFe1-xVxO3 nanoflake
networks. The c-BiFe1-xVxO3 nanoflake networks are compared
with the annealed BiFe1-xVxO3 (a-BiFe1-xVxO3) on the crystal structures and charge storage performances. The morphology and structure of BiFe1-xVxO3 are characterized by many necessary measurements, to certify the superiority of electrochemical induction. The
mechanisms of electrochemical induction and charge storage can
be revealed by the structural evolution study of o-BiFe0.95V0.05O3
in the cycling process. Additionally, the first-principles calculations
in the frame of density functional theory (DFT), are conducted to
reveal the roles of V doping and oxygen vacancies played in the
improvement of the built-in electric field of BiFe1-xVxO3 to facilitate electrolyte ion diffusion and boost rate capability. Based on
the c-BiFe0.95V0.05O3 anode and the PPyHG (polypyrrole hydrogel)
cathode, flexible asymmetric MSCs are assembled with PVA/LiCl
gel electrolyte and manifested to provide high capacitive performances"

the overpotential barrier usually occurring in symmetric supercapacitors, attributed to 
the thermodynamic decomposition of electrolytes.24 The Bi2O3 anodes are previously 
reported to exhibit the reversible redox reaction of Bi3+ regarded as “quasi-conversion 
reaction”, which can suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction of aqueous 
electrolytes.5
 However, the Bi2O3-based BSH devices, such as Bi2O3//AC,6

 have been reported to provide poor specific 
capacitance (< 100 F g-1), low energy density (< 36 Wh kg-1) and bad cyclic stability 
(< 85% for 4000 cycles). The bad rate capability and low power density are mainly 
attributed to multielectron Faradic reactions of the unmatched Bi2O3 electrodes for 
charge storage, which reflect relatively slower electrochemical kinetics than that of 
high-rate capacitive electrodes. To solve this, constructing composite structure has 
been considered as an effective strategy, resulting in the formation of Bi2O3/carbon 
composite electrodes, such as Bi2O3/activated carbon,25,26 Bi2O3/carbon quantum 
dot,27,28 Bi2O3/graphene.28 For instance, a graphene/carbon dots encapsulation 
structure for the Bi2O3 electrode supported by carbon nanotube films, has been 
reported to not only improve the conductivity but also inhibit the loss of capacity, 
which can account for the asymmetric supercapacitor with the energy density of 98.2 
Wh kg-1 and the capacity retention of 80.1% after 8000 cycles.28 Furthermore, the 
introduction of oxygen vacancies into crystal lattice of Bi2O3, has been considered as 
another effective route to the improvement of ion diffusion kinetics,29 which is 
essential for reasonably matching the battery-type electrodes with the capacitive 
electrodes in BSH devices. It has been previously confirmed that oxygen vacancies

can play an important role on the enhancement of electronic conductivity30,31 and the 
anion-based intercalation pseudocapacitance.22 With the oxygen-deficient Bi2O3, the 
assembled BSH device can provide an energy density of 86.6 Wh kg-1 and a capacity 
retention of 85% after 10000 cycles,29 but it seems to be not enough. 
Carbon shell protection is usually used to improve rate performance and cyclic 
stability of metallic oxides for electrochemical energy storage.9
 However, the 
necessary carbonization of precursors can not only form the carbon shells on the 
surface of metallic oxides as expected, but also inevitably produce oxygen vacancies 
into crystal lattice of metallic oxides, which tend to be neglected for the 
carbon-stabilized metallic oxides. Herein, we propose a novel BSH device based on 
the oxygen-deficient Bi2O3 nanoflakes stabilized by N-doped carbon and supported by 
graphite fibers (GF@Bi2O3-NCs) as a battery-type anode, the N/S-codoped carbon 
aerogels supported by graphite fibers (GF@NS-CAGs) as a capacitive cathode, and 
PVA/LiCl/H2O gel as electrolyte. The oxygen-deficient Bi2O3-NC nanoflakes can be 
prepared through carbonization of the electrochemically-deposited Bi2O3 nanoflake 
precursors previously immersed in melamine solution. The N-doped carbon shells as 
an outer layer of the Bi2O3-NC nanoflakes, can effectively improve specific capacity, 
rate capability and cycling stability. The GF@NS-CAG cathode can be obtained by 
carbonization of the GF@PSS-PPy hydrogel precursors. Based on the GF@Bi2O3-NC 
anode and the GF@NS-CAG cathode, flexible quasi-solid-state BSH devices with 
different mass loadings are assembled in a two-electrode configuration. The 
electrochemical kinetics can be analyzed, in order to further understand the energy

Currently, the fossil fuels are used as a source of energy and are
burned to generate electricity, which produces air pollution and environmental changes that impact the human health [1]. In order to
reduce the contamination produced by fossil fuels, renewable energy
sources such as solar and wind have been employed to produce electricity, but it is stored in conventional metallic batteries or supercapacitors which suffer of energy losses by warming/heating effects
[2]. For this reason, new technologies such as supercapacitors based on
metal organic frameworks (MOFs) or polyoxametalates have emerged
as an alternative to store energy from clean energy sources [3,4]. Particularly, MOFs are preferred because of their controllable structures,
high surface area and variable pore size, which benefits the electrochemical properties of supercapacitors [5]. For example, Zheng et al.
[6] reported a flexible supercapacitor made with a metal oxide@MOF
composite (Co3O4 nanocube@Co-MOF), which showed a high specific
capacitance of 1020 F g−1 (at 0.5 A g−1) while maintaining a high
cyclic stability (only a reduction of capacitance by 3.3% was observed
after 5000 cycles of charge/discharge). Apart from the property of
flexibility in supercapacitors (SCs), they should be compact and
stretchable, which would allow their incorporation/attachment to the
skin, clothes, or textiles. In addition, SCs should have high power
density, fast charge/discharge rates, and simple structure [7]. If the SCs
have those last characteristics, they can power wearable devices attached to skin or human organs [8]. Stretchable SCs have been manufactured in various forms such as stacked, planar, and wire-type. Particularly, yarn- or wire-shaped SCs have high mechanical stability upon
various deformations such as bending, knotting, and coiling [9]. To
date, many stretchable SCs have been fabricated on different substrates,
such as metal foils, polymers, textiles, and paper. Among them, textile
based substrates are suitable because they have large surface area due
to their porous structure [10]. However, when compared to Li-ion
batteries, those stretchable SCs still have disadvantages, such as low

energy density and lifetime. To enhance their energy density, some
groups have deposited pseudocapacitive materials like MnO2 or conductive polymers like polyaniline (PANI) on the textiles, but their
overall electrical conductivity decreases and they also suffer delamination (loss/detachment of the active oxide or polymer) during the
charge/discharge cycles, which in turn, decreases the stability of the
devices [10].
Currently, three main strategies are reported to develop stretchable
electrodes for SCs: 1) assembling devices with all stretchable components; 2) connecting stiff, active device components with stretchable
linkers; and 3) making stretchable devices through the use of waved or
textile structures [9]. Considerable efforts have been dedicated to develop SC electrodes/devices using these last approaches, nanostructured carbon materials and graphene: For example, Chu et al. [11]
designed a stretchable SC electrode constructed with hierarchical
carbon tubular nanostructures, conducting polyaniline, and stainlesssteel spring as a substrate. This electrode exhibited specific capacitance
of 277.8 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, 75% of capacitance retention over 3000
charge-discharge cycles, and can be 100% stretched without losing
electrochemical performance. Xie et al. [12] developed stretchable
polyaniline/graphene electrodes and fabricated a stretchable solid state
SC which had a maximum specific capacitance of 261 F g−1 at 1 A g−1
even under the strain of 30%, and showed capacitance retention of 89%
over 1000 charge/discharge cycles. Another work by Tamilarasan et al.
[13] demonstrated that SCs made with electrodes of PMMA/ionic liquid
([BMIM][TFSI])/graphene powder can reach a maximum capacitance
of 83 F g−1 (at 2.67 A g−1) at 30% strain and 220 F/g without any
deformation. This device had capacitance retention of 90% after 10
cycles of strain. Finally, Zang et al. [14] reported a simple and low-cost
method to fabricate stretchable SCs based on new crumpled-graphene
papers. The paper electrodes were stretchable up 800% and maintained
a high capacitance of 196 F/g, while the devices made with these
electrodes had a capacitance ranging 28–49 F/g when subjected to
150% uniaxial strain and 300% areal strain.
Although the graphene based stretchable SCs mentioned above have
descent capacitance values, their capacitive performance is still limited
by the low surface area of the graphene component. Therefore, most
research on stretchable devices focuses on the use of single wall-carbon
nanotubes (SW-CNTs), or multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MW-CNTs),
which are recently attractive due to their high electrical conductivity,
high charge transport capability, chemical stability, high surface area
(2000–3000 m2 g−1), and an appropriate balance between the surface
area and mesoporosity of the CNTs, which provide easier access for
electrolyte ions to form an electrical double layer on the interface between electrode and electrolyte [15]. Moreover, the CNTs have exceptionally high Young's modulus of elasticity (2–100 GPa), high
transparency, flexibility, and can support high current densities (up to
109 A cm−2) [15]. Due to these properties, the CNTs have been widely
employed to make stretchable electrodes/devices: Yu et al. [16] reported a SW-CNTs/polydimethylsiloxane stretchable electrode with
capacitance of 52 F g−1 at 30% strain. Park et al. [17] reported the
application of MW-CNTs/MoO3 NWs stretchable composite as electrode for SC, which showed a maximum capacitance of 48.3 F g−1 and
energy density of 4.28 Wh kg−1. This device retained ~80% of its initial capacitance after 5000 stretching/releasing cycles at a maximum
strain of 50%. Furthermore, Zhang et al. [15] presented flexible and
stretchable SCs composed of interwoven CNTs embedded in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrates with a capacitance of 0.6 mF
cm−2. This stretchable supercapacitor showed a consistent stretching
performance from 0% to 200% and bending/twisting angles from 0° to
180°, as well as a stable electrochemical performance during and after
10000 charge/discharge cycles. In addition, Wang et al. [18] demonstrated that a stretchable solid state device made with and electrode of
acrylate rubber/MW-CNTs/poly(1,5-diaminoanthraquinone) (anode)
and an electrode of acrylate rubber/MW-CNTs/PANI (cathode) can
produce an outstanding energy density of 2.14 mW h cm−3 and good
cycling stability under static and 50% strain conditions. Also, Tang
et al. [19] published the fabrication of a high-performance, stretchable
SC assembled by stacking CNTs/MnO2 film electrodes onto highly
stretchable and conductive hydrogel electrolytes. This device produced
a capacitance of 478.6 mF cm−2 at 0.5 mA cm−2 (or 201.1 F g−1) and
had capacitance retention of 91.5% after 3000 charging-discharging
cycles under 150% strain. Finally, Zhang et al. [20] fabricated a highly
stretchable and stable SC based on SW-CNTs/PANI composite electrodes and elastomers. The hybrid electrodes presented high stretchability, 140% elongation and capacitance of 435 F g−1, while the solidstate device made with these electrodes exhibited a maximum capacitance of 106 F g−1. This maintained capacitance retention above 90%
after 1000 cyclic elongations at 120% strain. Compared to flexible supercapacitors (500–1500 F g−1) based on carbon materials [21], most
of the approaches in the previous studies are limited by difficult fabrication processes or by low capacitance values (100–300 F g−1).
Moreover, the current stretchable SCs have the following disadvantages: 1) their discharge times are low (1–500 s); 2) the working
potential window of the devices is very limited (0.5–0.8 V); 3) the separator of the stretchable SC does not support as much strain as the
electrodes, which decreases the stability of the devices; and 4) their
architecture is very complex. Due to these problems, simpler ways to
fabricate stretchable SCs able to produce capacitance values above 500
F g−1 and longer discharge times are still desirable.
As an effort to develop low cost stretchable SCs with high capacitance and prolonged discharge times, we manually transferred CNTs
sheets on a stretchable silicon elastomer substrate and assembled two of
these electrodes to form the stretchable device (the separator was a
porous membrane made of rubber latex and acrylic polymer).
Zakhidov's group at the University of Texas at Dallas (UT Dallas) synthesized the stretchable CNTs used in this work, which were mechanically very strong (Young's modulus of 1–37 GPa) and presented
low sheet resistance (25–50 Ω/□) [22,23]. To the best of our knowledge, all solid state stretchable SCs fabricated with this type of CNTs
has not been reported. These devices presented a discharge profile that
included a capacitive component (exponential decay) and a stable
output voltage. This is a relevant result since the stabilization of voltage
after an exponential decay has not been observed previously in
stretchable SCs. This constant output voltage indicates a battery-type
behavior. When the stretchable device is not deformed, its capacitance
is 712.2 F g−1, but devices strained at 50% and 100% presented lower
capacitance values of 504.2 F g−1 and 130.1 F g−1, respectively. Surprisingly, the device stretched 525 times at 50% strain had a capacitance of 1328.3 F g−1 which is one of the highest values of capacitance
reported so far for stretchable devices. Hence, the results presented here
suggest that this new type of stretchable device could pave the way for
developing stretchable batteries with controllable output voltage."
254_intro.txt.txt,"supercapacitors can potentially bridge the gap between batteries and
conventional capacitors [5]. In other words, supercapacitors have
higher energy densities than conventional capacitors, at the same time
they have higher power densities and longer cyclic lifetime than lithium
ion batteries. Therefore, supercapacitors will be widely applied in a
number of electronic devices, such as hybrid electric vehicles, laptops,
cell phones and cameras [6]. In order to meet the growing demands for
energy storage devices, the energy density of supercapacitors should be
substantially improved, and their high power density and long cycle
life, meanwhile, should be maintained.
Recently MnO2-based electrode materials have attracted significant
attention due to their high theoretical capacity (1375 F g−1
), low material cost, and environment-friendly property [7–9]. As far as we know,
the reported performance of MnO2-based electrode materials is far poor
than their high theoretical capacity. Enormous efforts have been made
to improve the capacitive performance of manganese oxides, such as
enlarging the electroactive surface area [10], enhancing the conductivity [11], shortening the diffusion pathway of ion/electron [12],
and balancing the stresses induced by cyclic volumetric variation [13].
Manganese oxides with desirable nanostructured materials (nanoneedles [14], nanoflowers [15], nanoparticles [16], and so on) have
been developed and studied. Moreover, integrating manganese oxides
with carbon materials, like graphene [17], carbon nanotubes [18], and
carbon fibers [19], have been widely adopted to prompt the electrical
conductivity and decrease the overpotential. Indeed, compared to original MnO2, the electrochemical performance of MnO2-based nanocomposite is improved largely. However, the restriction of the contact
interface between MnO2 and conductive carbon materials limits the
enhancement of MnO2 conductivity.
Alternatively, a novel strategy creating oxygen vacancies has been
reported to modify the active sites and electronic properties of metal
oxides. The donor densities and thereby electronic properties can be
manipulated by controlling the concentration of intrinsic defects in
metal oxides. Many synthetic methods were reported to introduce
oxygen vacancies in metal oxides. Hydrogen treatment is an effective
method to create oxygen vacancies and promote the performance of
nanostructure metal oxides. Lu et al. reported that TiO2 nanotube arrays were modified by annealing the pristine TiO2 in hydrogen atmosphere at different temperatures for supercapacitors [20]. The hydrogen-treated TiO2 nanotube arrays showed much larger specific
capacitance (3.24 m F cm−2
) than the air-treated TiO2 nanotube arrays
at the same conditions, and also yielded remarkable rate capability and
outstanding long-term cycling stability. The prominent electrochemical
capacitive properties of hydrogen-treated TiO2 nanotube arrays are
attributed to the combined contribution of the improved donor density
and the increased density of surface hydroxyl groups. Hydrogen treatment has also been applied for other metal oxides and demonstrated to
be effective in improving the performance, such as WO3 nanoflakes
[21], ZnO nanorod array [22], and BiVO4 [23]. Oxygen-deficient αFe2O3 nanorods were obtained by thermal treatment of FeOOH nanorods in N2 atmosphere, and showed a remarkable areal capacitance
of 382.7 m F cm−2 at 0.5 mA cm−2 and an excellent long-term cycling
stability. The improvement in electrochemical performance is also attributed to the increased donor density and active sites resulting from
the formation of oxygen vacancies [24]. Inducing oxygen vacancies into
MnO2 nanorods by a simple hydrogenation treatment was also demonstrated an effective strategy to improve the conductivity and capacitive performance of MnO2 [25]. Compared with the untreated
MnO2 electrode, and the hydrogenation treated MnO2 could yield a
large areal capacitance (449 F g−1
), excellent rate capability and cycling stability. The author believes that the moderate concentration of
oxygen vacancies has great influence on the capacitive performance of
MnO2, and it is necessary to achieve the optimized electrochemical
activity. Kim et al. reported that α-MoO3 was synthesized by a one-step
microwave hydrothermal synthesis and the energy storage properties of
α-MoO3 were also improved substantially due to the incorporation of
oxygen vacancies [26]. The author believes that the introduction of
oxygen vacancies into the α-MoO3 lattice leads to not only great electrical conductivity, but also large interlayer spacing along the b axis.
Both of these features are likely to lead to improving faster kinetics and
enable the α-MoO3 structure to be retained during the charge/discharge
process. Moreover, yolk-shell-structured MnO2 microspheres with
oxygen vacancies were successfully obtained under a hydrogen/argon
gas atmosphere at 240 ℃, in which yolk-shell-structure and surface
oxygen vacancies of MnO2 were helpful to improvement in specific
capacitance (452.4 F g−1 and 316.1 F g−1 at 1 and 50 A g−1
, respectively), cycling stability (92.2 %), and excellent rate capability (∼79.2
% and 69.9 % of the initial capacity at 20 and 50 A g–1
, respectively)
[27]. However, the development of environment-friendly, cost-effective, scalable and controllable methods to intrinsically improve the
conductivity and capacitive performance of manganese oxides is still a
challenge.
In this paper, we studied a fast surface modification method by
plasma H2 for the synthesized flower-like MnO2. The influences of
plasma H2 modification on the morphology, structure, constitution and
electrochemical properties of MnO2 materials were investigated. It is
found that the longer the treating time is, the higher the concentration
of oxygen vacancies are. Meanwhile, the crystal structures of MnO2 are
not changed by plasma H2 treating and remain the same phase structure
of the raw material. MnOx-10 shows a high specific capacitance and a
super capacitance retention, which are atributed to the synergy effects
of the flower-like structure, large surface area, and appropriate concentration of oxygen vacancies."

Nowadays, with great demand for renewable energy systems,
supercapacitors have attracted immense attention as an important class of energy storage devices.1–4 Compared with batteries,
supercapacitors exhibit signicantly high power density and long
cycling life, and are expected to have more practical applications
if their energy density can be further boosted to a higher level.5,6
This motivation has driven extensive research efforts to enhance
the energy density and overall performance of supercapacitors in
order to broaden their application spectrum.5–8 Rational design
and synthesis of high-performance and low-cost electrode
materials are one of the keys to realize the target. In general,
based on the charge storage mechanism, supercapacitors can be
classied into electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) and
pseudocapacitors. In contrast to EDLCs in which capacitance
originates from the electrode/electrolyte interface charge
accumulation effect, pseudocapacitors can offer much larger
specic capacitance due to the fast and reversible redox reactions
on the electrodes and thus show higher energy density.9,10 Transition metal oxides oen possess higher specic capacitance and
electrochemical cycling stability than most conductive polymers,
and are preferred as electrode materials for supercapacitors.11–14
Among various pseudocapacitive oxides, nanostructured Cu
oxides and hydroxides are promising ones owing to their high
specic capacitance, elemental abundance and friendliness to
environment.10,15–18 Especially, cuprous oxide (Cu2O) stands out
because of its theoretical specic capacitance as large as about
2248 F g1

supercapacitor electrodes.19 Moreover, Cu2O oen exhibits better
cycling stability than CuO in alkaline electrolyte.20 For example,

Despite the notable progress of Cu2O-based supercapacitor
electrodes, how to achieve Cu2O-based electrodes simultaneously with large specic capacitance, high cycling stability
and high energy density by a simple method still remains
challenging. The effective strategy lies in increasing the electronic conductivity, improving the active site availability for
pseudocapacitive reactions, and providing short electron
transport pathways for fast electrode kinetics.9,10,23 Hybridizing
one dimensional (1D) or two dimensional (2D) conductive
carbon materials with oxide nanoparticles is an effective
way.12,20,24–27 In such nanocomposites, conductive carbon
nanosupports enable fast electron transport and facilitate the
kinetics of electrochemical reactions, while nano-sized metal
oxides can increase the effective surface area and shorten the
ion/electron diffusion paths, thus leading to high pseudocapacitive performance. Till now, most reported synthesis
approaches of Cu2O nanocomposites are wet-chemical
processes, which are oen complex and require a hightemperature treatment process.17,20–22,28–30 During the
processes, the precise control of the Cu valence is challenging,
and it is inevitable that the employment of additive agents or
stabilizers may damage the carbon material surface or induce
some adverse functional groups. Therefore, attempts toward
simple synthesis of small-sized and bare Cu2O nanoparticles
decorated on carbon nanosupports with high electrochemical
performance are still needed.
We have recently developed an alternative physical way to
prepare metal nanoparticles/carbon hybrids by directly sputtering metal onto room-temperature ionic liquid (RTIL).31,32
This process is a one-step and environmental-friendly approach
totally free of additive agent, stabilizer and by-product. In this
report, utilizing the RTIL-assisted method, Cu2O nanoparticles
anchored on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (abbreviated as
Cu2O/MWCNTs) with small size and high uniformity are obtained by directly sputtering metal Cu into a typical RTIL, 1-
butyl-3-methylimidazoliumtetrauoro borate ([BMIm][BF4]).
The prepared Cu2O/MWCNTs nanocomposite possesses excellent electrochemical properties including high specic capacitance, high cycling stability and good rate capability.
Furthermore, oxygen vacancies are introduced into the Cu2O/
MWCNTs nanocomposite by the NaBH4 treatment, which
further enhances the specic capacitance and rate capability of
the nanocomposite (abbreviated as r-Cu2O/MWCNTs). An
asymmetric supercapacitor using the r-Cu2O/MWCNTs nanocomposite as positive electrode and active carbon (AC) as
negative electrode is assembled, which features a high energy
density of 64.2 W h kg1 at a power density of 855.3 W kg1
, as
well as high cycling stability with capacitance retention of 93%
aer 20 000 cycling times. The results indicate the great
potential of the r-Cu2O/MWCNTs nanocomposite as positive
electrodes for high-performance supercapacitors"

257_intro.txt.txt,"INTRODUCTION
Electrochemical supercapacitors have recently gained 
attention for their quick discharge/charge ability. However, 
the limiting factor in supercapacitors is its storage capacity 
as compared to batteries or other high energy density 
storage devices. Early electrochemical supercapacitors 
achieved charge storage through double layer capacitance, 
achieved when ions from the electrolyte collect on the 
surface of the electrode. Since the number of ions that can 
gather at the surface is directly proportional to surface area, 
the energy storage of these electrodes can be further 
increased through texturization of electrode surface. 
This is often achieved by using high surface area 
materials with high intrinsic capacities, such as porous 
carbon, activated carbon, or carbon nanotubes. These 
supercapacitors charge and discharge quickly, as the charge 
is highly mobile and the charge layer forms only at the 
surface of the material. In contrast, lithium ion batteries 
have relatively slow charge discharge cycles, as ions must 
intercalate themselves into the material. Moreover, in the 
process of intercalation, electrodes may become susceptible 
to damage. For example, silicon, known as one of the 
highest energy density lithium ion battery materials, can 
expand up for 400% upon intercalation. Damage in double 
layer supercapacitors is minimal, since charge simply 
gathers on the surface and does not insert itself into the 
electrode area. 
The second mechanism of charge storage in an 
electrochemical supercapacitor is achieved by a faradaic 
redox reaction occurring at the surface of the electrode, or 
pseudocapacitance. In contrast to batteries, these reactions 
are much faster since they occur only on the surface layers 
of the electrode. However, many pseudocapacitors suffer 
from poor stability, since electrodes may experience damage 
from ion insertion. These two mechanisms of supercapacitor 
charge storage working in tandem can dramatically increase 
the charge storage capacity, depending on the device 
architecture and faradaic reaction. In our supercapacitor 
device, we increase the double-layer capacitance by using a 
vertically aligned carbon nanotube (CNT) forest, a high 
surface area material. We then further attempt to increase 
charge capacitance by conformally coating the CNT forest

heated, the catalysts form droplets, which form the basis for CNT growth. In an ethylene environment, a vertically aligned 
CNT forest is grown by CVD (step d). Finally, in step e, TiN is deposited conformally onto the CNT forest using ALD.

with titanium nitride (TiN), which has previously been 
shown to exhibit faradaic redox surface reactions due to 
increased oxygen vacancies at the surface (see Figure 1).
Titanium nitride thin films have been widely used as 
the protection coatings in machinery and contacts in 
microelectronics due to its exceptional hardness, mechanical 
stability, biostability, and good electrical conductivity. 
Increased oxygen vacancies through surface behavior of the 
native oxide in TiN films have also led to usages in 
electrochemical supercapacitors for increased capacitance. 
For these applications, control over deposition upon 
irregular surfaces and nanostructures is central in optimizing 
performance. However, previous titanium nitride 
supercapacitors have been limited in geometry or surface 
functionalization due to the difficulty of precise fabrication. 
These electrodes are fabricated through a two-step, high 
temperature process, limiting selection of high surface area 
electrode materials [1] [2], or deposited by sputtering with 
poor conformality and coverage [3]. Here we present 
results from depositions of angstrom-level precision ALD 
TiN onto porous CNT forest electrodes and their 
outstanding performances in the supercapacitor electrode 
applications.
In our electrode as illustrated in Figure 1, we achieve

high capacitance by (1) increasing the surface area using the 
porous CNT forest architecture; and (2) allowing for redox 
reactions to occur in the oxygen vacancy rich TiN surface 
layer. These results are comparable to other supercapacitor 
materials deposited by ALD onto vertically aligned CNT 
structures [4][5]. Specifically, the large surface area helps 
the electric double-layer capacitance as storage/release of 
electrical charges occurs by the adsorption/desorption of 
charges on the surface of TiN. The oxidation of the surface 
layer, TiO2-xNx, forms a native oxide layer with high 
nitrogen concentration and a large number of oxygen 
vacancies for the redox reactions, which help the Faradaic 
electrochemical storages as the pseudo-capacitance for 
enhanced energy storages. 
FABRICATION AND METHODS
Electrode Preparation
The CNT forest is grown as shown in Figure 2. First, a 
silicon substrate is prepared with 100nm thermally grown 
oxide. Next, a thin layer of molybdenum is deposited by 
electron-beam evaporation to form a conductive layer. The 
catalyst is a thermally evaporated mixture of 5nm iron and 
5nm aluminum, with aluminum acting to prevent 
molybdenum and iron from forming an alloy. The substrate 
is transferred to a vacuum quartz tube furnace to grow the 
CNT forest by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), as 
outlined by Yingqi Jiang et al [6]. Once the temperature of 
the furnace is stabilized at 720°C, the process gases, 
hydrogen and ethylene are introduced in a 7:1 ratio with 
respect to volumetric flow rate. When heated to high 
temperatures, the catalysts nucleate and form droplets on the 
conductive surface, forming the basis for the CNT forest. At 
this high temperature, when placed in an ethylene rich 
environment, the CNTs are then grown by CVD. 
TiN is ALD deposited using Tetrakis (dimethylamido) 
titanium (TDMAT) and nitrogen plasma as precursors. The 
process is highly dependent on ALD configuration, 
temperature, precursors, and is especially sensitive to
atmospheric contaminants. A Cambridge Nanotech Fiji tool 
was used to deposit the TiN. ALD deposition was tested for 
200°C, 250°C, and 300°C, as shown in Figure 5. Ultimately, 
TiN films deposited at 250°C were used as the temperature 
in Cambridge Nanotech’s standard TiN recipe. Additionally, 
as shown in Figure 5, films deposited at 250°C show the 
lowest oxygen to titanium ratio, indicating a higher amount 
of TiN in the sample. TDMAT heated to 75°C was pulsed 
for 0.25s, and N2 plasma pulsed for 20s at an overall 
chamber temperature of 250°C, with purge steps of 6s and 
5s, respectively, between the precursor steps. The pressure 
was on the order of millitorrs. The growth rate is roughly 6 
Å/cycle. The as deposited film forms a native oxide in the 
presence of atmosphere, which is exacerbated in high 
temperature environments. Therefore, the deposited film is 
left to cool for 30 minutes-1 hour under vacuum 
environment. 
Figure 3 shows SEM images of vertically aligned CNT 
forest coated with ALD TiN. As the images show, a CNT 
forest of roughly 30μm in height was successfully grown, 
corresponding to 20 minutes of growth time in an ethylene 
environment. Figure 3b is the TEM image of coated CNTs, 
showing conformal coating and uniform thickness of the 
ALD TiN, corresponding to 400 cycles of ALD. The CNT 
has diameter of 20nm and the TiN is roughly 20nm in 
thickness, consistent with the growth rate for this TIN 
recipe. 
Electrode Testing
The electrode is tested using a three-electrode setup in 
aqueous electrolyte. Electrodes were used as prepared and 
tested with Pt wire as the counter electrode. In aqueous 
0.5M H2SO4 solution, measurements were taken vs. 
Ag/AgCl reference electrode (see Figure 4).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
TiN-CNT, CNT, and planar TiN electrodes have been 
tested using a three-electrode setup with 0.5M H2SO4 as 
electrolyte, Pt wire as counter electrode, vs. Ag/AgCl as 
shown in Figure 6. The cyclic voltammetry curves shows an 
500

Faradaic redox reaction. This can be mitigated by electrolyte choice.
improvement of >500% in capacitance of the TiN-CNT 
device when compared to that of bare CNTs (81mF/cm2 for 
TiN-CNT and 14mF/cm2 for CNT electrodes), and an 
almost 400x improvement in capacitance when comparing 
CNTs with bare TiN electrodes (0.2mF/cm2
). 
In using a porous CNT framework, the almost 400x 
over a planar TiN electrode shows the significance of 
surface area on supercapacitor charge storage. Furthermore, 
the improvement of >500% in capacitance by conformal 
coating of TiN indicates that charge storage in the TiN 
device does not only take place by ion 
adsorption/desorption, but also through faradaic redox 
reactions, or pseudocapacitance. By increasing surface area 
(charge storage mechanism 1), one can drastically improve 
supercapacitor performance. However, using current 
methods of TiN deposition, one is limited to specific 
materials or surfaces. In contrast, our method of ALD TiN 
deposition is able to conformally coat with angstrom level 
precision, providing more flexibility in choice and 
architecture of the device.
In testing pseudocapacitive devices, stability must be 
considered, since damage to the electrode can occur with the 
insertion of ions, or damage to the electrode can occur in the 
case of non-reversible faradaic reactions. As can be seen in 
Figure 7, the device is relatively stable over charge 
discharge cycles. However, as can be seen in Figure 6, the 
reaction is not completely reversible. We hypothesize that 
this is due to irreversible oxidation at the surface of the TiN. 
Existing work on TiN supercapacitor devices have been able 
to show relatively stable oxygen vacancies in the presence 
of non-reversible oxidation due to simultaneous diffusion of 
nitrogen from the TiN bulk to the native oxide layer [2]. In 
the proposed system, the native oxide layer maintains the 
same number of oxygen vacancies, as the oxidation occurs 
through diffusion of oxygen into the bulk while nitrogen 
simultaneously diffuses from the bulk to the surface layer, 
implying that stability of the native oxide layer is also 
dependent on thickness of TiN film. Other existing work 
has mitigated stability issues through electrolyte choice. 
Preliminary testing in non-aqueous electrolyte of our TiNCNT device show a more reversible and stable electrode, as 
elemental oxygen is not available to oxidize the active layer. "
258_intro.txt.txt,". Introduction 
The rapid development of global economy has created significant 
demand of energy. Till date, the major sources of energy are the fossil 
fuels like coal, petroleum and natural gas which cause global warming 
due to the emission of greenhouse gases during the irreversible burning 
of these fuels. Therefore, alternative energy storage technologies are 
urgently needed to prevent the fast depletion of non-renewable fossil 
energy sources and mitigate the environmental degradation. Supercapacitors have drawn a great attention due to its high power density, 
long cycle life, energy efficiency, high safety performances and rate 
capability [1–9]. Supercapacitor bridges the gap between the capacitor 
and battery by achieving high energy density without sacrificing the 
power density. Supercapacitors can be classified into three categories 
depending on their charge storage mechanism: (i) EDLC (electric 
double-layer capacitor), (ii) pseudocapacitor, and (iii) hybrid 
supercapacitor. EDL is formed by the accumulation of charge due to the 
electrostatic attraction at the electrode/electrolyte interface [10,11]. An 
electric potential is build up at the electrode-electrolyte interface owing 
to the excess and deficiency of electrons at the conduction band. The 
nano carbonaceous materials such as, graphene, carbon black, carbon 
nanotube, etc. store charge by forming EDL at the electrode-electrolyte 
interface [12–17]. Pseudocapacitors (metal oxides/hydroxides/sulphides, conducting polymers) store charge by electrochemical adsorption/desorption across the generation of double layer and faradaic redox 
reactions at the electrode-electrolyte interface. Pseudocapacitors deliver 
higher energy density than EDLCs due to the faradaic redox reactions. 
There are three main pseudocapacitive mechanisms: (i) surface or near 
surface redox, (ii) under potential deposition, and (iii) ion intercalation 
[18–22]. There are lots of strategies to improve the specific capacitance 
of pseudocapacitive materials. Defect engineering through doping is the 
most promising way to tune the properties of metal oxide-based crystal

structure. The creation of vacancies could improve the overall electrical 
conductivity by modifying the electronic structure and providing more 
electrochemically active sites [23–25]. Recently, rare-earth elements 
have drawn attention to improve the electrochemical performance of 
different metal oxides due to their unique 4f electronic configuration. 
Lanthanide elements improve the electrochemical performance by the 
generation of oxygen vacancies. More oxygen vacancies induce greater 
oxygen diffusion rate which finally improve the overall electrochemical 
performance by shortening the ion transportation path [26–30]. La enhances charge transfer by reducing electron–hole recombination rate 
due to its multiplet electronic configuration. In addition, La helps to 
improve the electrochemical activity by increasing the active sites and 
lowering the crystallite size of the metal oxide-based electrode material 
[27,28]. Guangjie et al. synthesized La-doped Ni(OH)2 by electrodeposition method and investigated the effect of La doping into the Ni(OH)2 
crystal lattice [25]. Han et al. synthesized La doped NiO microsphere via 
hydrothermal method followed by calcination. The synthesized sample 
showed remarkable specific capacitance almost 2 times higher than the 
pristine NiO [27]. Asaithambi et al. synthesized La doped SnO2 
anchored reduced graphene oxide (La–SnO2@RGO) heterostructures by 
hydrothermal method and obtained ~1.5 times improved specific 
capacitance compared to the pristine SnO2@RGO [28]. Mane et al. 
synthesized La doped MnO2@GO thin film by using successive ionic 
layer adsorption and reaction method and investigated the electrochemical properties [31]. However, the electrochemical studies of Ladoped Ni-Sn oxide/RGO have not been reported yet according to the 
best of our knowledge. Herein, La doped Ni-Sn oxide/RGO (LNSRG) 
composite was successfully prepared with different concentration of La 
via facile hydrothermal method. The highest specific capacitance of 
~1238 F g− 1 at 3 A g− 1 current density was observed in the optimized 
sample LNSRG 2 composite in the potential window of 0–0.4 V using 6 M 
KOH as electrolyte. The effect of pH of the electrolyte on the electrochemical performance was investigated using various electrolytes. It 
was observed that the optimized LNSRG 2 composite operated in the 
potential window of 0–0.7 V in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte exhibited ~850 
F g− 1 specific capacitance at 2 A g− 1 current density. Asymmetric 
supercapacitor (ASC) device was fabricated with this optimized composite material as positive electrode and SRGO (sonochemically reduced 
graphene oxide) as the negative electrode material. The device operated 
in the potential window of ~1.6 V with high energy density of ~38 W h 
kg− 1 at a power density of 870 W kg− 1
. The ASC device retained ~75 % 
of its initial specific capacitance at 15 A g− 1 current density after 10,000 
charge-discharge cycles. 
2. Synthesis of LNSRG electrode materials 
Graphite oxide was prepared by modified Hummers method [32]. A 
beaker containing aqueous solution of NiCl2.6H2O and SnCl2.2H2O 
(Molar ratio, NiCl2:SnCl2 = 1:1) was stirred for 30 min. About 1 M 
aqueous NaOH solution was added dropwise into the metal salt solution 
followed by ~30 min stirring. Metal hydroxide phase was formed due to 
the reaction between Ni2+, Sn2+ and OH− ions [33,34]. About 1.5 mM 
aqueous solution of La(NO3)3 was added into the above solution followed by 30 min stirring. Then, the aqueous dispersion (2 mg ml− 1
) of 
graphene oxide (GO) was slowly added into the above solution followed 
by stirring and transferred to a 100 ml autoclave reactor and kept at

~180 ◦C for ~24 h. The final products obtained after washing and 
drying were designated as LNSRG 0, LNSRG 1, LNSRG 2, and LNSRG 3 
according to the concentration of La(NO3)3 as 0, 1.5, 2, 2.5 mM, 
respectively. The molarity of each precursor of the prepared samples is 
summarized in Table 1. Characterization details are discussed in supporting information. 
3. Results and discussion 
PXRD patterns of the prepared samples shown in Fig. 1 (a) exhibited 
the peaks at 2θ ≈ 26.81, 34.22, 40.07, 53.90 and 61.53◦ corresponding 
to the (103), (104), (310), (116) and (500) planes, respectively as 
indexed with the JCPDS file: 54-104 [35]. The peak at 2θ ≈ 25◦ indicated the existence of RGO in the composite samples. The absence of any 
peaks for La2O3 confirmed that La was successfully incorporated in the 
crystal structure [27]. Fig. 1 (b) shows that the computed XRD profiles 
after Rietveld refinement matched well with the experimental profile. 
The value of the goodness of fit (GoF) factor, the ratio of Rwp (weighted 
residual error factor) and Rexp (expected error factor) close to unity 
(~1.3) confirmed the best quality of refinement [36–38]. The lattice 
parameters such as crystallite size (D), lattice strain (ϵ), dislocation 
density (δ), GoF values obtained from the Rietveld output are summarized in Table 2. Fig. 1 (c) shows that doping of La in the crystalline 
lattice structure of Ni-Sn oxide resulted the loss of crystallinity due to the 
lattice distortion. The lattice distortion is attributed to the difference in 
ionic radius between the host and parent atoms. There is an obvious 
decrease in peak intensity with increase in La doping concentration due 
to the incorporation of dopant ion with larger ionic radius (La3+ ~ 103 
pm) than the host ions (Ni2+ ~ 70 pm, Sn4+ ~ 72 pm) resulting in the 
distortion of crystal lattice. The reduction in peak intensity is attributed 
to the difference in electron density between La atom and the parent 
atoms. But the corresponding intensity increased in LNSRG 3 than that 
of LNSRG 2 composite due to the existence of less defect states in the 
previous sample [39–42]. The shift of PXRD peaks towards the lower 
peak position in Fig. 1 (b) is due to the change in lattice parameters 
owing to the incorporation of hetero-sized dopant ion leads to the 
increased d spacing value. However, doping of La at higher concentration resulted small change in lattice parameter without significant 
shifting of peak position [38,42]. La doping could be defined as the 
unequal exchange resulting the oxygen vacancy as evidenced from the 
XPS analysis [43,44]. Table 2 shows the remarkable change in lattice 
parameters which confirmed the doping of La atoms in the host lattice. 
The dislocation density was calculated by using Williamson and Smallman's formula as follows: 
δ = 1
D2 (1) 
This equation showed that LNSRG 2 exhibited highest dislocation 
density indicating higher defect in this composite compared to the 
others as confirmed from the XRD peak shifting [41,42]. It was observed

that the change in lattice strain caused by the dislocations of La content 
varied reciprocally with the crystallite size. The decrease in crystallite 
size due to the proper incorporation of La in lattice site caused stress and 
distortion in the lattice. Therefore, LNSRG 2 with smallest crystallite size 
exhibited maximum lattice strain. All these observations confirmed the 
doping of La in nickel tin oxide/RGO crystal lattice. La doping destroyed 
the long-term periodic order of the lattice oxygen in the bimetallic oxide 
composite due to the significant change in crystallite size and lattice 
strain after doping [45–48]. 
Fig. 2 (a) shows the formation of agglomerated nano-sphere structure of LNSRG 0. Nano-flakes like structure began to form on the RGO 
sheets while increasing the La doping concentration. Fig. 2 (b) shows the 
formation of non-uniform mixed-shaped structure of LNSRG 1. The 
electrolyte ions faced difficulties to diffuse rapidly through this nonuniform structure [15]. Thus, this non-uniformity had a negative 
impact on electrochemical activities. When the doping concentration 
was ~2 mM, nano-flakes structure grew uniformly on the RGO sheets. 
Fig. 2 (c) shows the uniform nano-flakes morphology of LNSRG 2. The 
electrolyte ions may diffuse rapidly due to the uniform distribution of 
nano-flakes like particle on the RGO sheets leading to the improvement 
of electrochemical activities. Further increase in La doping concentration resulted the non-uniform morphology as evidenced from Fig. 2 (d), 
which resulted the decrease in the electrochemical activities. The 
elemental mapping of Ni, Sn, La, C and O and the EDS spectra of LNSRG 
2 in Fig. 3 (a-f) showed the existence of La in the composite at very 
minute amount further affirming the idea of La doping. SAED pattern 
image of LNSRG 0 is shown in Fig. 4 (a). The ring with bright spots 
indicated the crystalline structure of Ni-Sn oxide/RGO in LNSRG 0 as 
evidenced from the PXRD pattern analysis. HR-TEM image and the 
corresponding IFFT pattern of LNSRG 0 are shown in Fig. 4 (b-c), 
respectively. The distances between the two fringes in the IFFT pattern 
of L1 marked region were ~ 0.139, 0.153, 0.178, 0.199, 0.238 nm

corroborated well with the PXRD pattern analysis. HR-TEM image and 
the IFFT pattern of LNSRG 2 are shown in Fig. 4 (d-g), respectively. The 
distance between the two fringes calculated from the IFFT pattern of L2, 
L3, L4 marked regions were 0.201, 0.221, 0.244, 0.286 nm suggesting 
the maximum strain developed inside the LNSRG 2 resulted the increase 
in d spacing values. Presence of more distorted fringes in the IFFT patterns was originated due to the more lattice strain changed by LNSRG 2. 
The La contents in LNSRG 1, LNSRG 2, LNSRG 3 were 0.00392, 0.01186, 
0.01626 wt%, respectively as determined from the ICP-AES analysis. 
This information further confirmed about the successful adjustment of 
La in the samples. XPS survey spectra shown in Fig. S1 (a-c) and Fig. 5 
(a) confirmed the presence of La in LNSRG 0, LNSRG 1, LNSRG 2, and 
LNSRG 3. Presence of <1 atomic% of La (0.06, 0.10, 0.18) confirmed its 
role as dopant in the composites. This observation agreed well with the 
EDS spectra analysis. The satellite peak at 838.18 eV of La 3d shown in 
Fig. 5 (b) corresponded to the electron transfer from the valence band of 
oxygen to the empty orbit of La 4f. The corresponding binding energy of 
the splitting matched well with the reported data [49–52]. Generally, La 
3d spectrum is splitted into two peaks for the binding energies of 3d5/2 
and 3d3/2 [51]. However, the peak position of 3d3/2 of La3+ coincided 
with 2p3/2 of Ni thus, the 3d3/2 peak of La3+ could not fitted properly. 
Incorporation of La in Ni-Sn oxide crystal structure enhanced the oxygen 
vacancy in the lattice [53]. The O 1s spectra of LNSRG 0, LNSRG 1, and 
LNSRG 3 shown in Fig. S1 (d-f) further confirmed the presence of more 
oxygen vacant sites. Fig. 5 (c) shows the O 1s spectra of LNSRG 2 
exhibiting the peaks at 529.58, 530.92, and 532.27 eV corresponding to 
the lattice oxygen, oxygen vacancy and surface adsorbed oxygen, 
respectively [48,54–56]. At particular doping concentration of La, 
highest oxygen vacant sites were created in the lattice due to the 
destruction of lattice order as evidenced from the PXRD pattern analysis 
leading to the improved electrochemical activity by adsorbing more 
electrolytic anions during redox reactions [47,55]. The presence of 2p3/2 
and 2p1/2 peaks for Ni2+ and Ni3+ oxidation states as shown in Fig. 5 (d) 
revealed the existence of both the peaks [52,53]. Fig. S2 (a-b) confirmed 
the existence of Ni2+ and Ni3+ oxidation states in the deconvoluted Ni 2p 
spectra of LNSRG 1 and LNSRG 3. Fig. 5 (e) showed the peaks of 3d5/2 
and 3d3/2 for Sn2+ and Sn4+ oxidation states [52,53]. Fig. S2 (c-d) 
confirmed the existence of both the oxidation states in the deconvoluted 
Sn 3d spectra of LNSRG 1 and LNSRG 3. Table 3 shows that relative ratio 
of oxygen vacancy in LNSRG 2 was higher than the other samples. The 
highest degree of defect state (highest ratio of Ni3+/Ni2+ and Sn4+/ 
Sn2+) facilitated to enhance the overall electrochemical activity. In 
Fig. 5 (f), the presence of oxygenated functional groups (C–C, C–O, 
C–
–O in the C 1s XPS) confirmed the formation of RGO in the composite 
[13]. 
Fig. S3 (a-c) and Fig. 6 (a) describe the CV curves of LNSRG 0, LNSRG 
1, LNSRG 2 and LNSRG 3 recorded in 6 M aqueous KOH electrolyte. The 
presence of well-defined redox peaks during cathodic and anodic scan 
confirmed the battery type characteristics of all the samples [58]. So, 
faradaic redox reactions played an important role in electrochemical 
activities [7,14,15,20]. It was found that LNSRG 2 exhibited largest 
integral area indicating highest charge storage capability. This is owing 
to the easy ionic transportation of electrolytic ions through the uniform 
morphology of LNSRG 2. It is highly capable to adsorb more electrolytic 
ions due to obtaining higher oxygen vacancy as evidenced from the 
PXRD and XPS analysis. The observed fixed redox peak position of CV 
curves illustrated that LNSRG 2 obtained good reversibility as well as

good rate capability. Generally, the peak current varies linearly with the 
scan rate and the square root of the scan rate for the surface confined 
process and diffusion controlled process, respectively. In this case the 
peak current is due to the combination of surface confined process and 
diffusion controlled process [55–59]. 
i = k1ʋ + k2ʋ1/2 (2) 
i = aʋb (3) 
So, 
log i = log a + b log v (4) 
where, i and ʋ are peak current and scan rate and a & b are constants. 
Eqs. (3) & (4) show that the calculated values of b determine the nature 
of the process occurring at electrode/electrolyte interface. The value of 
“b” can be calculated from the graph logarithm of peak current vs. 
logarithm of scan rate. When this value is exactly same as 0.5 or 1, then 
the process is diffusion controlled redox process or adsorption controlled 
surface process [59]. Fig. 6 (b) shows that the value of b for cathodic and 
anodic process of LNRG 0, LNSRG 1, LNSRG 2, LNSRG 3 is 0.60, 0.76, 
0.84, 0.77, respectively indicating that the reaction occurs at electrode/ 
electrolyte interface is controlled by the combined effect of diffusion 
controlled redox process and surface controlled process. The charge 
discharge curves of LNSRG 0, LNSRG 1, LNSRG 2, and LNSRG 3 at 3 A 
g− 1 current density as observed in Fig. 6 (c) corroborated well with the 
CV curves by matching the potential plateau with the redox potential. 
Fig. 6 (d) shows that the calculated specific capacitance of LNSRG 0, 
LNSRG 1, LNSRG 2, and LNSRG 3 were 562, 862, 1238, 750 F g− 1
, 
respectively at the current density of 3 A g− 1
. LNSRG 2 exhibited highest 
specific capacitance compared to the others due to the highest capability 
of storing charge. More oxygen vacancies in LNSRG 2 enhanced the 
amount of stored charge by creating more active sites for electrolytic 
ions [60]. EIS was performed in the range of 0.1 to 10,000 Hz frequency 
with 10 mV a.c. sinusoidal bias. Fig. 6 (e) & Fig. S3 (d-g) show the 
equivalent circuit diagram and Z view fitted plots. Rs represents the 
uncompensated resistance. Electrolytic ions face difficulties during 
transportation through the electrode materials. This finite resistance and 
inter-particle contact resistance jointly yields the charge transfer resistance, Rct. The resistive impedance is constant throughout the entire 
frequency range [61–64]. Generally, capacitance arises due to the separation of charges at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Capacitive 
impedance causes phase shift of ~90 0 between the applied voltage and 
the current and it is very high at low frequency range [65–68]. Electrolytic ion diffusion rate varies inside the electrode materials resulting 
the change in time constant due to the inhomogeneities and surface 
roughness. A constant phase element (CPE) is introduced instead of a 
general capacitor with phase shift (not equals to 900
) caused by timeconstant dispersion. The impedance of CPE is Z= 1
Aj⍵α, the value of α 
becomes 0 and 1 for pure resistive and capacitive property, respectively. 
When 0 < α < 1, it represents the capacitive property with resistance. 
The presence of Warburg element (WO) indicated the diffusion of electrolytic ions within the electrode materials. This impedance combines 
the effect arisen due to the charge kinetics and charge transfer control. 
At low frequency regions, electrolytic ions get enough time to diffuse, 
thereby increasing the Warburg impedance. At high frequency regions, 
electrolytic ions can't diffuse at very far distance thereby decreasing the 
Warburg impedance [68]. In Fig. 6 (e), the charge transfer resistance is 
arranged in parallel combination with CPE due to the charge transfer 
kinetics and charge separation at different sites of the electrode material. 
At low frequency region, the charge transfer kinetics is more effective 
than the diffusion controlled kinetics. As WO represents diffusion kinetics, WO and Rct are connected in series [69]. Wo is a function of three 
components: WO-R (Warburg diffusion impedance), WO-T (diffusion 
time constant), and WO-P (phase factor). CPE is a function of two parameters such as CPE-T and CPE-P which are constant phase element 
exponent and capacitance extent, respectively [71–73,75]. The fitting 
parameters of the prepared samples are summarized in Table S1. It is 
seen that LNSRG 2 exhibited lowest charge transfer resistance (Rct ~ 10 
Ω) resulting the shortest electrolytic ion diffusion path and favoured 
good electrochemical properties. It was found that the operated

potential window was 0–0.4 V in 6 M KOH electrolyte. Yokoyama et al. 
showed that the operating potential window can be optimized by controlling the pH of the electrolyte [70]. At neutral pH, the possibilities of 
HER & OER reaction in the electrolyte are less than that of basic electrolyte resulting the wider potential window [70–73]. Fig. 6 (f) shows 
the CV curves at different pH (6 M KOH, 1 M Na2SO4) of the electrolyte 
at 50 mV s
− 1 scan rate of LNSRG 2 electrode material illustrating the 
dependency of the operating potential window on the pH of the electrolyte. The charge storage is associated with the adsorption/ desorption 
of electrolytic cations on the surface. The electrolytic anion mainly took 
part in the redox charge transfer process of the cations resulting the 
change in the oxidation state [74–76]. 
In case of KOH electrolyte, the possible capacitive mechanism is 
given below: 
NiO + OH− ⟶NiOOH + e−
SnO2 + OH− ⟶SnOOH + e−
In case of Na2SO4 electrolytes, the possible capacitive mechanism is 
given below: 
NiO + SO4
2− ⟶NiOSO4 + 2e−
SnO2 + SO4
2− ⟶SnOSO4 + 2e− .
So, more electrolytic ions transport easily into the electrode material 
during the redox reactions [77,78]. Fig. 7 (a) shows the CV curves of 
LNSRG 2 at 1 M Na2SO4 at different scan rates suggesting that the charge 
storage process is pre-dominant by the diffusion controlled process due 
to the presence of redox peaks with less-sharpness. GCD curves of 
LNSRG 2 recorded at different current density as shown in Fig. 7 (b) 
implied good rate capability and reversibility of the electrode [57,62]. 
More triangular nature of charging-discharging curves illustrated that 
the charge storage mechanism was governed by the diffusion controlled 
process as confirmed from the CV curves [79]. The calculated specific 
capacitance values recorded at 2, 3, 4, 7, and 10 A g− 1 were 850, 680, 
430, 410, 205 F g− 1
, respectively. At high current density, electrolyte 
ions could not get enough time to transport through the electrode materials resulting into a decreased capacitance value. All the GCD curves 
possess high columbic efficiency (CE) of ~92 % implying its excellent 
kinetic reversibility [60]. Z view fitted EIS plot shown in Fig. S3 (h) 
exhibited ~15 Ω charge transfer resistance of LNSRG 2 confirming the 
fast charge transfer kinetics at electrode/electrolyte interface. SRGO was 
prepared by similar procedure as reported by Jana et al [32]. The reason 
of using SRGO as negative electrode is its wide negative operating potential range as shown in Fig. S4 (a, b). The mass loading of two electrode materials was calculated by using the eq. (S1). The masses of 
positive and negative electrode materials were ~300 and ~1300 μg, 
respectively. The CV curves recorded at different potential window of 
the ASC device in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte are shown in Fig. S4 (c). No 
polarization was observed in the potential window range of 0–1.6 V. The 
CV curves shown in Fig. 7 (c) illustrated good rate capability and 
reversibility of the ASC device [60]. For comparison, the CV curves of 
the ASC device using 6 M KOH electrolyte are shown in Fig. S5 (a) in the 
potential range of 0–1.4 V. Fig. S5 (b-c) showed that the ASC device 
exhibited higher capacitance and potential window at 1 A g− 1 current 
density using 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte (106 F g− 1
) compared to the 6 M 
KOH electrolyte (104 F g− 1
). The energy density of the ASC device was 
found to be ~28.31 W h kg− 1 and 38 W h kg− 1 in 6 M KOH and 1 M 
Na2SO4 electrolyte, respectively. So, further electrochemical characterizations of the ASC device were performed in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte for 
achieving higher energy density. GCD curves of the ASC device in1 M 
Na2SO4 electrolyte recorded at different current densities as shown in 
Fig. 7 (d) revealed almost symmetrical behavior. The Z view fitted EIS 
plot of the ASC device in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte is shown in Fig. 7 (e). 
The equivalent circuit is similar as described earlier and the fitted values 
of the ASC device are shown in Table S2. ASC device exhibited ~20 Ω 
charge transfer resistance indicating fast charge transfer kinetics at the 
electrode/electrolyte interface. The ASC device attained maximum energy density of ~38 W h kg− 1 at ~870 W kg− 1 power density. The 
electrochemical performance of the developed ASC device was

compared with the state-of-the-art materials displayed in Fig. S5 (c) and 
summarized in Table S3 of the supporting information. The device 
exhibited ~20 W h kg− 1 energy density even at high power density of 
7400 W kg− 1
. The performance of the ASC device can be boosted up by 
generating tri-metallic oxide through complexing it with another hetero 
atom and also by increasing electrochemically active sites through codoping strategies. Fig. 7 (f) shows that the ASC device retained ~75 % 
of its initial specific capacitance at 15 A g− 1 current density after 
continuous 10,000 GCD cycles. The variation in columbic efficiency 
(CE) and energy efficiency (EE) with the current density is shown in 
Fig. S5 (d). The CE values reached ~100 % at 10 A g− 1 current density 
indicating that the reversibility and stability of charge-discharge process 
increased with current density. The ASC device showed good charge 
storage capability at higher current densities. Fig. 8 (a-d) shows that two 
ASC devices connected in series was capable for lighting up a 1.8 V red 
LED light. The electrochemical results confirmed the practicability of the 
fabricated ASC device. "

The rapid development of global economy has created significant 
demand of energy. Till date, the major sources of energy are the fossil 
fuels like coal, petroleum and natural gas which cause global warming 
due to the emission of greenhouse gases during the irreversible burning 
of these fuels. Therefore, alternative energy storage technologies are 
urgently needed to prevent the fast depletion of non-renewable fossil 
energy sources and mitigate the environmental degradation. Supercapacitors have drawn a great attention due to its high power density, 
long cycle life, energy efficiency, high safety performances and rate 
capability [1–9]. Supercapacitor bridges the gap between the capacitor 
and battery by achieving high energy density without sacrificing the 
power density. Supercapacitors can be classified into three categories 
depending on their charge storage mechanism: (i) EDLC (electric 
double-layer capacitor), (ii) pseudocapacitor, and (iii) hybrid 
supercapacitor. EDL is formed by the accumulation of charge due to the 
electrostatic attraction at the electrode/electrolyte interface [10,11]. An 
electric potential is build up at the electrode-electrolyte interface owing 
to the excess and deficiency of electrons at the conduction band. The 
nano carbonaceous materials such as, graphene, carbon black, carbon 
nanotube, etc. store charge by forming EDL at the electrode-electrolyte 
interface [12–17]. Pseudocapacitors (metal oxides/hydroxides/sulphides, conducting polymers) store charge by electrochemical adsorption/desorption across the generation of double layer and faradaic redox 
reactions at the electrode-electrolyte interface. Pseudocapacitors deliver 
higher energy density than EDLCs due to the faradaic redox reactions. 
There are three main pseudocapacitive mechanisms: (i) surface or near 
surface redox, (ii) under potential deposition, and (iii) ion intercalation 
[18–22]. There are lots of strategies to improve the specific capacitance 
of pseudocapacitive materials. Defect engineering through doping is the 
most promising way to tune the properties of metal oxide-based crystal

structure. The creation of vacancies could improve the overall electrical 
conductivity by modifying the electronic structure and providing more 
electrochemically active sites [23–25]. Recently, rare-earth elements 
have drawn attention to improve the electrochemical performance of 
different metal oxides due to their unique 4f electronic configuration. 
Lanthanide elements improve the electrochemical performance by the 
generation of oxygen vacancies. More oxygen vacancies induce greater 
oxygen diffusion rate which finally improve the overall electrochemical 
performance by shortening the ion transportation path [26–30]. La enhances charge transfer by reducing electron–hole recombination rate 
due to its multiplet electronic configuration. In addition, La helps to 
improve the electrochemical activity by increasing the active sites and 
lowering the crystallite size of the metal oxide-based electrode material 
[27,28]. Guangjie et al. synthesized La-doped Ni(OH)2 by electrodeposition method and investigated the effect of La doping into the Ni(OH)2 
crystal lattice [25]. Han et al. synthesized La doped NiO microsphere via 
hydrothermal method followed by calcination. The synthesized sample 
showed remarkable specific capacitance almost 2 times higher than the 
pristine NiO [27]. Asaithambi et al. synthesized La doped SnO2 
anchored reduced graphene oxide (La–SnO2@RGO) heterostructures by 
hydrothermal method and obtained ~1.5 times improved specific 
capacitance compared to the pristine SnO2@RGO [28]. Mane et al. 
synthesized La doped MnO2@GO thin film by using successive ionic 
layer adsorption and reaction method and investigated the electrochemical properties [31]. However, the electrochemical studies of Ladoped Ni-Sn oxide/RGO have not been reported yet according to the 
best of our knowledge. Herein, La doped Ni-Sn oxide/RGO (LNSRG) 
composite was successfully prepared with different concentration of La 
via facile hydrothermal method. The highest specific capacitance of 
~1238 F g− 1 at 3 A g− 1 current density was observed in the optimized 
sample LNSRG 2 composite in the potential window of 0–0.4 V using 6 M 
KOH as electrolyte. The effect of pH of the electrolyte on the electrochemical performance was investigated using various electrolytes. It 
was observed that the optimized LNSRG 2 composite operated in the 
potential window of 0–0.7 V in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte exhibited ~850 
F g− 1 specific capacitance at 2 A g− 1 current density. Asymmetric 
supercapacitor (ASC) device was fabricated with this optimized composite material as positive electrode and SRGO (sonochemically reduced 
graphene oxide) as the negative electrode material. The device operated 
in the potential window of ~1.6 V with high energy density of ~38 W h 
kg− 1 at a power density of 870 W kg− 1
. The ASC device retained ~75 % 
of its initial specific capacitance at 15 A g− 1 current density after 10,000 
charge-discharge cycles.

(Molar ratio, NiCl2:SnCl2 = 1:1) was stirred for 30 min. About 1 M 
aqueous NaOH solution was added dropwise into the metal salt solution 
followed by ~30 min stirring. Metal hydroxide phase was formed due to 
the reaction between Ni2+, Sn2+ and OH− ions [33,34]. About 1.5 mM

With the rapid development of portable wearable electronic devices, 
hybrid electric vehicles, smart grids and other high/new technologies, 
the urgent demand for energy storage systems, including supercapacitors (SCs) and batteries, has aroused the interest of many researchers [1–4]. Compared with battery energy storage device, SCs have 
high power density, fast charging and discharging, long cycle life and 
good thermal stability [5–7]. These characteristics further demonstrate 
the great potential of SCs as an power-type energy storage devices 
[8–10]. 
Generally, transition-metal oxides (TMOs) or hydroxides are widely 
used as pseudocapacitors materials owing to their rapid redox reaction 
and high theoretical specific capacitance at the electrode/solution 
interface [11–13]. Among various TMOs materials, MnO2, as one of the 
most promising supercapacitor electrode materials [14] owing to the 
high theoretical specific capacity (1370 F g− 1
), large specific surface 
area and low price, have attracted great attention from researchers [15]. 
However, the inherent poor electronic/ion transport and unstable 
crystal structure characteristics of pure MnO2 materials severely limits 
its specific capacitance and cycling stability. To solve those weaknesses, 
more and more efforts have been paid to the fabrication of unique coreshell heterostructure electrodes, such as MnOx@C@MnOx, MnFeOx, 
MnO2@FeOOH MnO2@NiCoLDH/CoS2, MnO2@MnO2 [16–21], in 
which alpha-type MnO2 with a stable tunnel crystal structure is usually 
introduced as the core. Moreover, manganese or nickel based dihydroxides (LDH) and their derivatives are ideal materials for the preparation of high performance electrode materials of SCS [22–25]. LDH is a 
large laminated material consisting of alternately arranged metal cations (divalent, trivalent, and tetravalent) balanced by charge

Over the past decades, the desire for high-performance energy storage devices has become imminent due to the incoming energy dilemma 
and resource exhaustion [1–3]. Supercapacitors (SCs) have drawn wide

capability, high power density, and environmental friendliness [4–6]. 
Moreover, the electrode material is a key factor in determining the 
performance of supercapacitors [7–9]. Hence, developing novel electrode materials to satisfy the cumulative demand has become the focus 
for researches [10,11]. 
Taking all electrode materials into consideration, NiCo2O4 is getting 
significant attention in the area of energy storage owing to high theoretical capacity and rich valence. To date, many NiCo2O4-based materials have been reported. For instance, Tu's group reported the

two-step solution-based method, and the specific capacitance of the 
obtained materials achieved 2.20 F/cm2 at a current density of 5 mA/

nanowire arrays on Ni foam substrate followed by annealing in an argon 
atmosphere, and the obtained electrode exhibited dramatically high

which would result in disappointing rate capability and cycling stability

drawbacks, and the rate capability and cycling stability of NiCo2O4 are 
enhanced by introducing carbon-based materials [22,23]. However, 
promoting the electrochemical performance in this way is always 
sacrificing the electrochemical activity on account of the limited electroactive sites. In this regard, a simple yet effective strategy that can 
obtain decent rate capability and desirable cycling stability without 
sacrificing electrochemical performance is highly desirable [24,25]. 
Recently, constructing hollow/porous configuration is regarded as 
an effective strategy to enhance the properties of supercapacitors, which 
could boost ions transport rate, ensure high electrochemical utilization, 
and offer rich active sites [26–28]. In addition to constructing unique 
morphology, oxygen vacancies are considered as a novel strategy in 
optimizing electrochemical performance, the decreased crystallinity 
could promote electrolyte penetration, facilitate ions/electrons transfer, 
and ensure sufficient contact between electroactive sites and electrolytes 
[29–31]. 
Taking these above factors into considerations, in this work, a facile 
structural-electronic synergistic modulation strategy is proposed to 
improve the rate capability and long-term durability of NiCo2O4 
simultaneously. Specifically, oxygen vacancy and phosphate ions 
modulated NiCo2O4-CoO nanocubes featured with hollow/porous 
configuration (NiCo2O4-CoO (Ov) HNs) are fabricated through templateassisted route illuminated by Pearson's hard and soft acid-base principle 
combined with partial reduction process. The obtained products depict 
desirable electrochemical behavior ascribed to the following characteristics: (i) The inner hollow configuration together with mesoporous 
walls could supply rich electroactive sites and offer large electrode/ 
electrolyte interfaces for fast ions transfer. Beyond that, the void space 
could buffer the structural change during charge-discharge process. (ii) 
The rich oxygen vacancies within NiCo2O4-CoO (Ov) HNs could offer 
superior conductivity, fasten ions migration rate, and furnish rich electroactive sites. Moreover, phosphate ions could promote electrochemical reaction reversibility significantly. As a result, the as-prepared 
NiCo2O4-CoO (Ov) HNs confirm the enhanced rate capability and longterm durability simultaneously. Overall, this work may open up new 
opportunities for developing metal oxides for high-performance

drawbacks, and the rate capability and cycling stability of NiCo2O4 are 
enhanced by introducing carbon-based materials [22,23]. However, 
promoting the electrochemical performance in this way is always 
sacrificing the electrochemical activity on account of the limited electroactive sites. In this regard, a simple yet effective strategy that can 
obtain decent rate capability and desirable cycling stability without 
sacrificing electrochemical performance is highly desirable [24,25]. 
Recently, constructing hollow/porous configuration is regarded as 
an effective strategy to enhance the properties of supercapacitors, which 
could boost ions transport rate, ensure high electrochemical utilization, 
and offer rich active sites [26–28]. In addition to constructing unique 
morphology, oxygen vacancies are considered as a novel strategy in 
optimizing electrochemical performance, the decreased crystallinity 
could promote electrolyte penetration, facilitate ions/electrons transfer, 
and ensure sufficient contact between electroactive sites and electrolytes 
[29–31]. 
Taking these above factors into considerations, in this work, a facile 
structural-electronic synergistic modulation strategy is proposed to 
improve the rate capability and long-term durability of NiCo2O4 
simultaneously. Specifically, oxygen vacancy and phosphate ions 
modulated NiCo2O4-CoO nanocubes featured with hollow/porous 
configuration (NiCo2O4-CoO (Ov) HNs) are fabricated through templateassisted route illuminated by Pearson's hard and soft acid-base principle 
combined with partial reduction process. The obtained products depict 
desirable electrochemical behavior ascribed to the following characteristics: (i) The inner hollow configuration together with mesoporous 
walls could supply rich electroactive sites and offer large electrode/ 
electrolyte interfaces for fast ions transfer. Beyond that, the void space 
could buffer the structural change during charge-discharge process. (ii) 
The rich oxygen vacancies within NiCo2O4-CoO (Ov) HNs could offer 
superior conductivity, fasten ions migration rate, and furnish rich electroactive sites. Moreover, phosphate ions could promote electrochemical reaction reversibility significantly. As a result, the as-prepared 
NiCo2O4-CoO (Ov) HNs confirm the enhanced rate capability and longterm durability simultaneously. Overall, this work may open up new 
opportunities for developing metal oxides for high-performance 
supercapacitors"

265_intro.txt.txt,"Introduction 
In recent years, the demand of high-tech products such as smartphones, TVs and tablets is exponentially growing. People demand 
more compact and powerful devices that can be operated for longer 
times [1]. For this last purpose, lithium ion batteries (LIBs) are widely 
used, but their cost is continuously increasing because the sources to 
extract Li are becoming scarce [2]. For this reason, other energy storage 
devices such as flexible supercapacitors have attracted considerable 
attention. Particularly, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are currently preferred 
for flexible SCs due to their high electrical conductivity (103
–105 S/cm), 
high surface area (2630 m2 g− 1
), interconnected/porous morphology, 
low weight and high mechanical strength (102
–103 MPa) [3]. In this 
sense, some reports about efficient CNT based electrodes for SC applications have been published: Saikia et al. [4] reported that 
carbon-nanotubes/graphene composites (rGO/FCNT) can produce a 
maximum capacitance of 302 F g− 1 and energy density of 41.65 Wh kg− 1 
(at 1 A g− 1
), but their capacitance retention was low (only 72%). 
Moreover, Lv and coworkers [5] reported that porous carbon nanotubes 
with large specific surface area of 296 m2 g− 1 can produce a maximum 
capacitance of 100 F g− 1 and energy density of 7.38 Wh kg− 1 (at 0.5 A 
g− 1
). The capacitance retention and coulombic efficiency were 83.7% 
and 100% after 10,000 cycles of charge/discharge. Regarding flexible 
SC devices, Yang et al. [6] used N/S-codoped carbon nanotube aerogels 
as electrodes for flexible SCs and obtained a capacitance of 328 F g− 1 
and energy density of 45.6 Wh kg− 1 (at 1 A g− 1
). The devices also presented high capacitance retention of 97.4% after 10,000 cycles of 
charge/discharge. Furthermore, Yin et al. [7] combined CNTs with SiC 
nanowires (NWs) to form an entangled SiCNWs@CNTs network, which 
was decorated with NiCo2O4 nanosheets (NSs) to form electrodes. The 
flexible SCs fabricated with these electrodes exhibited a moderate 
capacitance of 180 F g− 1 and energy density of 64.2 Wh kg− 1 (at 1 A g− 1
)

while maintaining a high capacitance retention of 94.2% after 5000 
cycles of charge/discharge. In general, the flexible CNT based SCs/electrodes present several disadvantages such as: i) low discharge times 
(<10 min), ii) low operating voltage (<1 V), iii) the materials used to 
encapsulate them are made of non-biodegradable plastics and iv) these 
devices employs gel-electrolytes made with toxic/corrosive compounds 
(PVA/KOH, H2SO4 or Na2SO4). 
On the other hand, the deterioration of the nature has incremented 
due to the contamination of the oceans and rivers by plastics, acids and 
dyes [8]. Also, the soil contamination has increased dramatically the last 
years due to the storage of trash coming from plastics, damaged batteries 
and textiles underground in dumps [8]. For these last reasons, it is 
desirable the incorporation of biodegradable materials in the energy 
storage devices. This would avoid high levels of contamination in the 
environment and would reduce the risk of intoxication for humans [9]. 
Moreover, the development of environmentally friendly technologies is 
necessary for energy storage devices (batteries and supercapacitors) 
because they are consumed by millions of units per year around the 
world. Due to this current need, some works about supercapacitors 
fabricated with eco-friendly components have been recently published: 
Moon et al. [9] synthesized a biodegradable gel electrolyte 
(NaCl− agarose gel) and used it in flexible supercapacitors with the 
configuration: MnO2/NaCl− AGAR/MnO2. This device showed a high 
capacitance of 286.9 F g− 1 and good capacitance retention of 80% after 
1200 cycles of charge/discharge. The group of sudhakar et al. [10] also 
reported a biodegradable polymer electrolyte for SCs, which was made 
by mixing chitosan (CS) and starch. In this case, the electrodes of the 
solid state supercapacitors (not flexible) were activated porous carbon 
deposited on stainless steel. Such devices exhibited a moderated 
capacitance of 133 F g− 1 and energy density of 18.5 Wh Kg− 1
. Moreover, 
Lee et al. [11] reported fully biodegradable planar microsupercapacitors 
(MSCs) fabricated with water-soluble metal electrodes (W, Fe, and Mo) 
supported on biodegradable substrates of polymer poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid). Those devices produced an areal capacitance of 1.6 mF cm− 2
, 
energy density of 0.14 μWh cm− 2 and capacitance retention of 100% for 
bending or rolling conditions. Another work by Zhao et al. [12] reported 
flexible SCs made with a biodegradable mesoporous cellulose membrane 
as separator. Those SCs showed a maximum capacitance and energy 
density values of 101 F g− 1 and 4.37 Wh kg− 1
, respectively. The stability 
of such devices was high because their capacitance retention was 84.7% 
after 10,000 cycles of charge/discharge. In addition, Liu et al. [13] 
published the manufacture of a hybrid device (battery-supercapacitor) 
composed of metallic zinc as anode, a biodegradable ionic liquid (IL) as 
electrolyte, and graphite as cathode. The SC device reached a maximum 
capacitance of 125 F g− 1 and energy density of 53 Wh Kg− 1 as well as 
capacitance retention of 86% after 1000 cycles of charge/discharge. 
Although these devices above were fabricated with some biodegradable 
components, they still have some issues: 1) Their capacitance and energy density are low (<300 F g− 1 and <100 Wh Kg− 1
), 2) most of their 
components in these batteries (electrodes, separator and electrolyte) are 
non-biodegradable (except for the wire supercapacitor mentioned 
above), 3) their discharge times are short (<10 min), which make them 
unsuitable for portable devices that require charge for long times and 4) 
most of them employ corrosive/toxic compounds (KOH, LiCl or Na2SO4) 
in the electrolytes. 
As an effort to improve the electrochemical performance of flexible 
and biodegradable SCs for commercial applications, we have fabricated 
flexible CNT based SCs by using biodegradable electrodes made of jelly/ 
CNTs and employed as separator a porous rice paper. To enhance the 
efficiency of these SCs, we added in their anodes a Barium ferrite. This 
material is a good candidate for SC electrodes because it has a high Curie 
temperature, high magnetic anisotropy field, high chemical stability and 
excellent corrosion resistivity [14]. In fact, magnetic BaFe12O19, 
(BaFeO) has been widely used for electromagnetic shielding [15] and 
has been selected for this work for two main reasons: It has not been 
explored its effect on the performance of flexible CNT based SCs and it is 
a pigment that can be quickly dispersed in solvents such as water and 
alcohol, making a slurry-paste that can be easily deposited on the 
electrodes of SCs. In addition, the use of ferrites on the electrodes of 
supercapacitors is promising, since other magnetic ferrites such as 
NiMnFe2O4 and MnCoFeO4 have produced high capacitances in the 
range of 600–1220 F g− 1 [16,17]. We estimate that 90% of the mass of 
our best SC device is biodegradable and it presents a high capacitance 
and energy density values of 861.6 F g− 1 and 172.3 Wh kg− 1
, respectively. These values are among the highest reported so far for biodegradable SCs. Also, such device presented a stable operating voltage for 
at least 10 h, which has not been previously observed in solid state 
biodegradable SCs. Thus, the results presented here could motivate to 
the scientific community for the development of “green energy storage 
devices” with high electrochemical performance. "
267_intro.txt.txt,"ecause of global energy needs, consumption of
fossil fuels and worsening environmental pollution,
there is an urgent need to develop alternative and
environment-friendly materials for sustainable storage and retrieval of electrical energy.1,2 To that end,
supercapacitors (also known as electrochemical
capacitors or ECs) have emerged as a promising
alternative to rechargeable batteries because of
their considerable advantages such as ultrahigh
power density, fast charge-discharge capability,
excellent reversibility, superior operating lifetimes.3,4 With these superb properties, supercapacitors have been used in various applications such as
in lightweight electronics, memory actuators, standby power systems and hybrid electric vehicles
(HEVs).1,5
Depending on the energy storage mechanism,
supercapacitors may be classified into two types:
electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) and pseudocapacitors.6 EDLCs store energy mainly by electrostatic attraction to generate charge accumulation
in the electric double layer at the electrode and
electrolyte interface.7 Energy storage in pseudocapacitors is through the faradaic reaction process,
which involves fast and reversible redox reactions
between the electrolyte ion and the surface of
electrodes.8,9 The capacitance of EDLCs is based
on their total porous volume and pore size distribution. Even though EDLCs have a long life and
sufficiently large power densities, their capacitance
is rather low and limited by the electrode material
surface area.10,11 However, capacitance of pseudocapacitors depends on the nature and porosity
distribution of the electrode. Comparing to EDLCs,
pseudocapacitors store and provide relatively larger
specific capacitances.
Electrode materials play a significant role in
determining electrochemical performance of supercapacitors.12 Many typical electrode materials
include (i) carbon materials, such as activated
carbon, grapheme,13 and carbon nanotubes/nanofibers;14 (ii) conducting polymers, such
as polypyrrole (PPy),15 polyaniline,16 and polythiophene;17; and (iii) metal oxides, such as RuO2,
18
MnO2,
19,20 and Mn3O4.
21 Among these pseudocapacitor materials, metal oxides stand out for delivering higher specific capacitances and energy
densities.22 The rare earth ions in rare earth oxides
can enhance specific capacitance and cycle stability.23 CeO2 is one such rare earth oxide that is
abundant and inexpensive, has unique redox properties and a high mobility of oxygen vacancies at its
surface. These characteristics make CeO2 desirable
as electrode material. 24,25 However, when Ce4+ is
reduced to Ce3+, the crystal lattice of CeO2 expands,
resulting in structural deformation. Therefore,
CeO2 may not be suitable for use as an electrode
material due to its low electronic conductivity and
structure stability.26,27 To remedy this problem, it is
feasible to combine carbon materials or metal oxides
with CeO2 as supercapacitor electrode materials.28–31 Sun et al.32 designed mesoporous Zr-doped
CeO2 nanostructures showing a specific capacity
(448.1 C g1
) at 1 A g1
, which is much higher than
pristine CeO2 (249.3 C g1
). Macheswarj et al.33
prepared Ag-incorporated CeO2 nano-cauliflowers
as supercapacitor electrode materials. The resulting
excellent rate capacity (1012 F g1 at 10 A g1
) and
good capacitance retention (100% over 1500 cycles)
were attributed to the high conductive property of
Ag and the efficient redox activity of CeO2. Considering the practical applications, the low-cost and
environment-friendliness transition element Mn
may be used to improve the capacitance performance of CeO2. In addition, MnO2 possesses excellent electrochemical properties and has theoretical
capacitance values up to 1370 F g1
.
34,35 Moreover,
Ce4+ is unstable and can be easily reduced to Ce3+,
which may lead to the collapse of the internal
synthetic structure. In contrast, Mn4+ forms a
relatively stable structure to stabilize Mn-Ce oxides.
Therefore, it is necessary to study the Mn-Ce oxide
composite material formed by Mn-doped CeO2 as a
supercapacitor electrode.
In this work, we designed and fabricated the MnCe oxides with different Mn:Ce ratios via bath
precipitation followed by a high-temperature oxidation process. Electrochemical properties were tested
by cyclic voltammetry (CV), constant current
charge/discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). As a result, the Mn-Ce
oxide composite demonstrated a high specific capacitance of 163.7 F g1 with a remarkable 78.4% cyclic
stability after 3000 charge-discharge cycles at a
current density of 1 A g1
. The morphology, crystal
structure of Mn-Ce oxides, pure MnO2 and pure
CeO2 have been compared through x-ray diffraction
(XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In
addition, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
was used to study the Ce3+, Ce4+ and oxygen
vacancies in Mn-Ce oxides. Results demonstrate a
synergistic effect between Mn and Ce, which not
only enhances the specific capacitance but also
optimizes the structure capability of supercapacitors. Results indicate that Mn-Ce layered double
oxides are an excellent candidate for supercapacitor
electrodes.

268_intro.txt.txt,"ntroduction 
Developing high-performance and low-cost electrochemical energy 
storage devices has been an extensively studied field, not only driven 
from the wide application areas (i.e. portable electronics, electric 
transportation and electrical grid), but also because of the global 
warming and the depletion of fossil fuels. The electrochemical capacitors, also known as supercapacitors, boast outstanding advantages in 
energy storage applications, thanks to their high power density, high 
safety level, fast charge and discharge, and long lifecycle [1,2]. Based on 
the charge-discharge mechanism, the supercapacitors could be categorized into two main types, including electrical double-layer capacitors 
(EDLCs) and pseudocapacitors. EDLCs employing carbon materials are 
limited by low capacitance and low energy density. To improve on energy density and capacitance, the pseudocapacitors have been widely 
investigated by researchers, where the charge and storage rely on 
interfacial Faradic reactions between electrolytes and electrodes [3–5]. 
Up to now, a number of transition metal oxides (i.e. RuO2, Co3O4, MnO2, 
NiO, V2O5, etc.) have been shown to exhibit representative pseudocapacitor behaviors [6]. 
Among the metal oxide candidates, Co3O4 appears as an attractive 
electrode material thanks to its highly reversible redox behavior, high 
corrosion resistance, low cost and excellent theoretical specific capacitance (3560 F/ g) [7,8]. Nonetheless, the specific capacitances of Co3O4 
are typically lower than 1000 F/ g from current studies, owing to poor 
electrical conductivity. Since the surface area and electronic states of the 
Co3O4 electrodes play critical roles for the final electrochemical performances, two main strategies have been attempted with developing 
various nanostructures and morphologies as well as hybrid material 
systems with carbon material or noble metals [6,9]. For example, 
various architecture Co3O4 catalysts composed of well-shaped nanostructures have been investigated [10,11]. As second approach, the 
preparation of Co3O4-based composites, e.g. hybridizing with Pt, graphene, MnO2, have revealed improved performances, attributed to the

synergistic effect of these composites [12]. However, it has been reported that the restriction of metal oxides/conductor interfaces limits 
the improvement of supercapacitor performances [13]. 
Another alternative solution for overcoming low electric conductivity of metal oxide electrodes is introducing oxygen vacancies, as well 
as accelerated surface redox reactive kinetics and thus enhancing their 
electrochemical performances [3,13–15]. It should be noted that Co3O4 
is a reducible oxide with weak Co–O bond strength and low barriers for 
oxygen vacancies [9], indicating one of the most promising approach for 
supercapacitor electrodes. There have been only a few researches on the 
influence of oxygen-defective metal oxides on supercapacitor aspect 
[9,16]. For example, post-treatment with hydrogen gas, laser ablation 
and chemical reagents (i.e. NaBH4) have been commonly used for 
forming oxygen vacancies after synthesis procedure of electrochemical 
metal oxides [9,14,16]. Although these methods are able to obtain 
oxygen-deficient metal oxides, extra treating cost and duration would be 
required, suggesting less interest. Besides, for crystalline nanoscale 
materials, various nanostructures with different exposing facets have 
drawn attentions in electrochemical applications, due to the different 
geometric and electronic structures [17–19]. Taking Co3O4 as an 
instance, the effect of exposed facets on Li-batteries and oxygen evolution reactions has been reported [19–21]. Given the two optimization 
strategies in minds, if the Co3O4 supercapacitor electrodes featured with 
high-activity facets and oxygen vacancies, the resultantly better conductivity and higher active sites would thus make contribution to 
improved supercapacitor electrodes. 
In the present work, we demonstrate the development of Co3O4 
supercapacitor electrodes featured with oxygen vacancies and submicron porous spheres via a novel deposition approach. This technology, 
named solution precursor plasma spray process, allows the direct synthesis and deposition of binder-free metal oxide electrodes, as well as insuit introducing oxygen vacancies during deposition process [22,23]. It 
deserves to be mentioned that the binder-free feature not only improves 
the transportation of electrons and the diffusion of ions, but also increases the effective surface areas of active nanopowder, resulting in 
degraded capacitance and cycling life [24–26]. To our best knowledge, 
there is blank for studying the synergic effects of oxygen vacancies, 
crystal facets and binder-free for supercapacitor electrodes. Herein, not 
only insight analyses have been provided by both of experimental and 
first-principles calculations, but also the resulting electrodes exhibited 
excellent performances with a specific capacitance up to 1276 F/g at a 
current density of 2 A/g and a retention of 96.9% after 13,000 cycles at a 
scan rate of 20 mV/s. "

to develop various new flexible energy storage devises. Among them, the flexible supercapacitors 
have drawn much attention because of their higher power density and longer cycling performance 
than those of lithium ion batteries (LIBs)[1]
. In recent years, diverse fabrications of flexible 
supercapacitors have been reported in numerous researches. However, these devices still suffer 
from the finite capacitance values and low energy density. To meet the growing needs for high 
energy storage efficiency, developing novel flexible electrode materials with fast charge-discharge 
capacity, high stability and good mechanical property has become an emerging field[2]
. In previous
studies, a great deal of electrode materials such as carbon materials, transition metal oxides 
(TMO)/compound oxides and electrically conductive polymers have been widely designed and 
prepared for flexible supercapacitors[3]
. In general, TMO /compound oxides have higher 
capacitance and energy density than carbon materials and electrically conductive polymers, but 
TMO /compound oxides generally show lower flexibility and power density than carbon materials 
and electrically conductive polymers
[4]
. Hence, the challenge here is to synthesize a flexible
supercapacitor electrode material with ultrahigh flexibility, high areal capacitance, elevated power 
and energy density.
For such of electrode materials, flexible compound oxides thin film materials with excellent
electrochemical energy storage properties may be regarded as a new avenue to meet this great 
demand. Previous researches indicate that oxygen vacancies in the transition metal based 
compound oxides are supposed to the charge storage sites for pseudo-capacitive applications[5]
.
Then, the compound oxides materials containing oxygen vacancies can possess a good pseudo
capacitance behavior and stability in aqueous electrolytes. As a result, the LaMO3 (M=Mn, Co Ni
and so on) with perovskite structure which exhibited high specific capacitance and energy density
has been reported on previous study [6]
. For example: Elsiddig and etc have synthesized a series of 
LaMn1±xO3 perovskite (x = 0, 0.05, 0.1), and the nonstoichiometric LaMn1.1O3 sample showed 
much higher specific capacity of 202.1 mAh·g

; Bose’s research group has 
fabricated a symmetric two electrode cell system to investigate the real life application of LaMnO3
as a supercapacitor, and the device show a maximum energy density of 52.5 Wh·kg−1
at a power 
density of 1000·W kg−1
; Lin’s research group has synthesize the LaxSr1−xCoO3−δ (0.3≤x≤1) 
nanofibers (LNF-x) by Electrospun method, and the LNF-0.7//LNF-0.7 device with an extended 
operating voltage range of 0-1.6 V displays excellent electrochemical performance with a high 
energy density of 34.8 Wh·kg−1 with 400 W·kg−1
; Li and etc have prepared two-dimensional 
perovskite LaNiO3 nanosheets with hierarchical porous structure, which achieves a high specific 
capacitance of 139.2 mAh·g
−1
at a current density of 1.0 A·g
−1 [7]
. As the high specific capacitance 
of compound oxides can be attributed to oxygen-vacancy-mediated redox, we can select a new

compound oxide with large oxygen vacancies numbers for the application of energy store. Among 
various compound oxides, the A2B2O7-type lanthanum zirconate (LZO) ceramic thin film with 
pyrochlores structure is considered attractive because of their good electrical conductivity 
properties, strong chemical resistance, high stability and outstanding oxygen-vacancy structure [8]
. 
According to charge-storage mechanism, the oxygen vacancies of LZO should be the charge 
storage sites [9]
. Hence, we can increase the energy store ability of LZO by rising the number of 
oxygen vacancies. Based on the previous study, the number of oxygen vacancies may be increased 
by doping with different element in both A or B sites of LZO, respectively[10].
Therefore, the 
transition metal elements as Y and so on can be substituted into LZO lattice to achieve this aim in 
this research.
However, there are still challenges associated with the ceramic LZO thin film material. One 
of the major issues is the rigidity nature of ceramics. The LZO thin film prepared for flexible 
supercapacitor electrode should have the special properties like good mechanical strength, flexible 
as fabric, little thickness, minor grain sizes and good grain boundary bondings[11]
. Another issue is 
related to the uppermost layers of the electrode materials, which determined the vaule of 
pseudo-capacitance. As the pseudo-capacitors store charges only occur in the uppermost layers 
and the adsorption of ions from the electrolyte shape a monolayer on the electrode surface, the 
formation of a nanostructure with high specific surface area is a very important parameter for the 
electrode materials[12]
. Therefore, selection of appropriate fabrication method for the LZO thin 
film is a very crucial task. The most promising approach to enhance flexibility and specific surface 
area of LZO is the electrospun technique which is a simple, one-step and cost-effective method to 
produce inorganic nanofibers[13]
. Generally, the electrospinning method can regulate and control 
the grain size, crystal lattice and chemical constitution of the oxides, which could achieve the 
faster redox reactions and shorter diffusion paths for energy store process. In addition, we can 
adjust the fiber size and film thickness by controlling the various electrospinning parameters, such 
as the applied potential, precursor concentration, viscosity and flow rate of the solution and so on. 
Therefore, the LZO thin film made from electrospinning method always had a little thickness of 
<500 μm, greatly increasing the permeability of electrolyte.
In this contribution, we developed flexible ceramic La2YxZr2-xO3 nanofibers (0≤x≤0.5) based 
thin film flexible electrode, which could provide generous oxygen vacancies for energy storage.
The La2YxZr2-xO3 nanofibers (when x=0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, samples denoted as LNF, LNF-0.1, LNF-0.3, 
LNF-0.5) were firstly synthesized by electrospinning method followed by calcinations. Then the 
electrode was fabricated by attaching the LNF-x thin film on the soft-matter substrate with
polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder, in which the LNF-x accounted for 85 wt%. In this 
research, we explored the microstructure, morphological characteristics, specific surface area,

chemical composition and electrochemical performance of LNF-x samples by using XRD, SEM, 
TEM, BET, XPS and electrochemical work station. In addition, the symmetrical 
LNF-0.1//LNF-0.1 flexible supercapacitor device showed a long-term cycling stability and a large
areal capacitance of 138 mF·cm

demonstrated a good energy density, high powder density and excellent mechanical flexibility.

China.
2.2 Preparation of the electrospun nanofibers

Firstly, La(NO3)3·6H2O, Y(NO3)3 and Zr(AC)4 solution were weighed according to the molar ratio of 
2: x: 2–x respectively. After that, these salts were dissolved in the absolute ethanol. Second, the 20 
wt% poly(vinylpyrolidone) (PVP) was dissolved PVP in absolute ethanol and stirring for 4 h. 
Then, the PVP solution was added into the salts solution under continuous stirring until to form 
homogeneous solution (about 12 h). In the electrospinning process, the flow rate of the solution 
was 0.3 mL·h
-1
, the positive potential was 15 kV (HD90, High voltage power supply, China) and 
the distance between the needle tip and the collector was 15 cm. Then, these electrospun fibers 
were annealed in the muffle furnace at 650～1050°C for 2h under air atmosphere without 
conducting foil, and the heating rate for the calcination of all the samples was 3°C/min. 
2.3 Characterization of the nanofibers.
The structures of LNF-x were studied by the Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku-D/max, 
Cu-Kα) with step length 0.01° over 5° to 90° 2θ range. The calcination temperature was 
determined by the Thermal Gravimetric Analyzer (Netzsch TG 209 F1 Libra). The organic groups 
of precursor nanofibers were analyzed by the Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (Vertex 70). 
The morphologies of the samples were observed using a scanning electron microscopy (SEM, 
Cam Scan2600 FE) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, FEI Tecnai G20). The 
composition of LNF-x samples were analyzed by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS, 
PHI-5000 Versaprobe). The specific surface areas were measured by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller 
(BET) measurements (BET, Micromeritics ASSP 2020 equipment).

Wurtzite zinc oxide (ZnO, with a wide bandgap of ∼3.37 eV
and an exciton binding energy of ∼60 meV) is a technologically
important material because of its intriguing optical and electrical
properties.1 Being a strong emitter, it finds applications in gas
sensors, solar cells, UV light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and laser
diodes.2–5 Doped zinc oxide has the potential of a sustainable
transparent conducting oxide (TCO), with simultaneous optical
transparency and a better conductivity.6–8 Numerous dopants
have been used to enhance the electrical and optical properties of
ZnO, e.g., group-I elements: Li, Na, and K and group-III elements:
Al, Ga, and In.9–14 These dopants are introduced as substitutional
defects on zinc sites.15,16
The luminescence properties of ZnO are extensively explored.17–22
A strong emphasis is placed on ultraviolet emission for UV LEDs and
UV phosphors.23–26 Vacancies and interstitials of zinc and oxygen give
rise to visible luminescence. These defect-related emissions are located
in a wide range of the visible spectrum, such as violet,27 green,28,29
yellow,30,31 and orange-red emissions.32–35 The intensity of the visible
luminescence can be controlled by modifications in the synthesis
techniques and chemical compositions.36–38 It is well-known that
extrinsic defects due to Li1+ and Al3+ doping in ZnO produce acceptor and donor levels, respectively. Simultaneous doping of Al3+ and
Li1+ further modifies acceptor and donor levels and may result in
interesting photoluminescence properties.
Among transition metal oxides, RuO2 exhibits higher specific
capacitance and has been recognized as the best electrode materials
for supercapacitors; but, on the other hand, their expensive nature
and high toxicity limit their practical application in a large scale.39
Thus, the fabrication of supercapacitor electrode materials with
low-cost production is challenging in the field of energy storage
devices, and hence, it is important to explore more desirable materials for supercapacitor applications. ZnO, as a potential supercapacitor electrode material, has been preliminarily demonstrated owing
to its high specific energy density, good electrochemical activity,
eco-friendly nature, and abundant availability.40–42
In this work, a combined effect of Al3+ and Li1+ on the structural, optical, and electrochemical properties has been examined.
The photoluminescence properties of Al/Li modified ZnO have been
examined in correlation with oxygen and dopant related defects.

272_intro.txt.txt,"n recent years, the rapid depletion of fossil energy sources
and the low utilization of renewable energy sources have led us
to focus on efficient energy storage devices.1 Owing to the
remarkable properties, such as high power density and long
operation durability, supercapacitors (SCs) have attracted significant research interest.2 Present research efforts in the SC
field are devoted to achieving high energy storage capability
through the exploration of novel electroactive materials and
nanostructural engineering of electrode materials.3–5
Transition metal sulfides (TMSs) have been widely explored
as electrode materials for SCs owing to their superior electrical
conductivity to hydroxides or oxides.6 Compared with singlemetal sulfides (e.g., NiSx and CoSx), binary TMSs, particularly
nickel–cobalt sulfides (NiCoS), exhibit higher electrochemical
activity since the synergistic effect between multivalent Co and
Ni ions leads to rich faradaic redox reactions.7 Unfortunately,
the slow redox reaction kinetics and the severe volume
changes during charge/discharge result in poor rate performance and inferior cycle life.8 To tackle these challenges, constructing robust NiCoS nanostructures with large specific
surface area and high porosity for fast charge transfer is a feasible approach.9 Recently, metal–organic framework (MOF)-
engaged synthesis has been regarded as an effective tactic to
construct various micro-/nanostructures for electrochemical
applications.10–13 Zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF)-67,
formed by the coordination of Co2+ ions with 2-methylimidazole (2-MIM) linkers, is one of the mostly utilized MOF
templates for preparing versatile electrode materials on
account of its excellent stability and simple synthesis.14,15
ZIF-67 derivatives usually present porous and hollow nanostructures, which can expose a large number of electroactive
sites and accommodate the volume expansion of electrode
materials during electrochemical processes.16 Besides, an integrated electrode is superior to that prepared from powder
since the “dead volume” of auxiliary additives is avoided.
However, three-dimensional (3D) ZIF-67 nanocrystals are
prone to intergrow into membranes on supporting substrates,
resulting in degraded electrochemical performance of ZIF-67
derivatives. Alternatively, two-dimensional (2D) Co-ZIF-L
(similar to ZIF-67 in composition and synthesis) nanosheets
can be well oriented on various conductive substrates (e.g., Ni
foam and carbon paper).17,18 Therefore, it is feasible to directly
construct NiCoS nanoarrays on conductive substrates from the
Co-ZIF-L template, where the advantages of MOFs and binary
TMSs are coupled.
To further enhance the electrochemical properties and optimize the electrode structure of TMSs, an effective strategy is

transition between Ce3+ and Ce4+ facilitates the charge transfer
between CeO2 and the supported electrode material.20,21 The
oxygen vacancies in CeO2 can reduce the energy band gap of
CeO2, resulting in improved electrical conductivity.22 Besides,
CeO2 has been used as a protective layer to improve the cycling
durability of electrode materials.23 Hence, it is expected that

273_intro.txt.txt,". Introduction 
Conventional supercapacitors (SCs) and lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) 
are unable to simultaneously possess the characteristics of high specific 
energy and good specific power [1–3]. The ions adsorption/desorption 
energy storage mechanism of SCs results in high power density but low 
capacity [4, 5]. On the contrary, LIBs possess high capacity but poor 
power density based on lithium-ion intercalation/de-intercalation reaction mechanism [6, 7]. To integrate the advantages of LIBs and SCs, 
lithium-ion capacitors (LICs) are designed [8, 9], which combine 
capacitive positive electrodes (such as active carbon [10], graphene [11] 
and carbon nanotube [12]) with battery-type negative electrodes (such 
as graphite [13], LTO [14], Nb2O5 [15] and MnO [16]). Due to the 
integration of these two types of energy storage mechanism, LIC could 
simulatively satisfy the requirements for the energy and power density. 
However, the slow battery-type reaction rate in negative electrode fails 
to keep up with swift capacitive reaction rate in positive electrodes [17]. 
This kinetics mismatch between positive and negative electrodes lead to 
insufficient electrochemical performance of LICs [18]. Besides, the 
worse electrochemical reversibility of battery-type negative electrode 
also exhibits worse performances at high rates [19]. Therefore, negative 
electrode materials are the key to offset the kinetics mismatch. 
An ideal negative electrode should have high reversible capacity, 
good rate capability and low voltage plateau. Lithium titanium oxide 
(LTO) negative electrode materials display high rate capability but low 
capacity and high voltage plateau (1.5 V vs Li/Li+) [20]. Commercial 
graphite negative electrodes present low voltage plateau (0.1 V vs 
Li/Li+) but deliver unappealing theoretical capacity and rate capability 
[21]. By contrast, manganese oxide is a promising negative electrode 
with high theoretical capacity, low lithium-ion intercalation potential 
(0.5 V vs Li/Li+). Nonetheless, the extensive application of MnO2 
negative electrodes is astricted by its intrinsic drawbacks of unengaging 
conductivity and sluggish lithium-ion diffusion in bulks [22–25]. To 
tackle these problems, researchers have taken various strategies, mainly 
including nano-crystallization [26–29] and compositing with carbon 
materials [30–32]. For instance, Wang et al. [33] developed a composite 
electrode with good electrochemical properties by anchoring Mn3O4 
nanoparticles on porous carbon microrods. Dubal et al. [34] owed the 
performance enhancement to the strategy of intercalating MnO2 nanoparticles into carbon nanosheets. The electrochemical improvement of

manganese oxide can be endowed with the decreased ion diffusion 
pathway and the increased reaction sites. Furthermore, the intrinsic 
physicochemical property of manganese oxide also plays a vital role in 
electrochemical performance. Oxygen vacancies are usually introduced 
in metal oxides to adjust the electron structure and reduce the energy 
bandgap [35]. Oxygen vacancies could not only enhance electron 
mobility on the surface of electrodes but also boost the ion adsorption 
property in the vicinity of electrode. These merits effectively improve 
electrochemical performance of electrodes [35–41]. 
LICs use different types of materials as positive electrode and negative electrode. The specific capacity of positive electrode is usually lower 
than that of negative electrode. It thus results in capacity mismatch of 
LICs. Pre-lithiation lowers the potential of negative electrode and increases the working potential range of positive electrode. This eventually enhances the electrochemical performance of LICs [42]. Graphite 
negative electrode owns a platform near 0.1 V resulting from the 
intercalation of lithium ions into graphite crystals. Thus, the LICs with a 
pre-lithiated graphite negative electrode could make full use of working 
potential range of positive electrode, which lead to a higher capacity of 
the LICs. However, as a result of slow phase transformation of lithium 
ions intercalation, LICs with pre-lithiated graphite negative electrode 
have poor rate capability. Hard carbon and soft carbon own lower degree of graphitization than graphite. Lithium ions intercalation into hard 
carbon or soft carbon reacts within a wide range of potential other than a 
platform. The slope of charge and discharge curves of soft and hard 
carbon is larger than graphite. As a result, the working potential of 
pre-lithiated hard carbon and pre-lithiated soft carbon negative electrode is higher than pre-lithiated graphite negative electrode. LICs with 
pre-lithiated hard carbon or soft carbon negative electrode thus have 
lower energy densities than LICs with pre-lithiated graphite negative 
electrode. However, hard carbon and soft carbon own faster lithium ions 
intercalation than graphite because of the disordered crystal structure 
[43]. LICs with pre-lithiated hard carbon or pre-lithiated soft carbon 
negative electrode thus own higher rate capability than LICs with 
pre-lithiated graphite negative electrode. Furthermore, the 
pre-lithiation degree also has critical influences upon the working 
voltage ranges (vs Li/Li+) of both positive and negative electrodes [44, 
45]. Therefore, carrying out pre-lithiation and fitting pre-lithiation degree should be taken into consideration in order to optimize electrochemical performance of LICs. 
Herein, manganese oxide nanosheets with oxygen vacancies and 
reduced graphene oxide composites (OV-MnO2/rGO) are synthesized as 
negative electrode materials for LICs via simple chemical precipitation 
followed by annealing. Through introducing moderate amount of oxygen vacancies, the stability and kinetics of negative electrodes are 
effectively improved. Moderate amount of oxygen vacancies endows 
OV-MnO2/rGO negative electrodes with high capacity (1052 mAh g − 1 
at 0.1 A g − 1
), good rate capability (506 mAh g − 1 at 1 A g − 1
) and 
cycling performance (87.3% retention for 450 cycles at 1 A g − 1
). 
Asymmetrical LICs are assembled with OV-MnO2/rGO negative electrodes and N-doped carbon nanosheets positive electrodes to evaluate 
practical application. In LICs pouch cells with three electrodes, the realtime working voltage is monitored to reveal the voltage changes of 
electrodes with different pre-lithiation degrees. Meanwhile, LICs with 
fitted pre-lithiation yield ultrahigh energy density of 206.2 Wh kg − 1 at 
250 W kg − 1
, a power density of 25,000 W kg − 1 at 41.7 Wh kg − 1 and a 
cycling performance of 79.8% capacity retention after 10,000 cycles. "

As the continuous development of new energy power electric vehicles, smart grids, and other emerging technologies, the requirements for 
clean energy and new energy storage devices are becoming increasingly 
urgent. Compared with conventional energy storage system, SCs have 
attracted wide interest for the merits of rapid charge/discharge rate, 
long cycle life, as well as excellent power density, which make them 
occupy a significant position in the field of energy storage in the future 
[1]. However, the relatively low energy density seriously hinders their 
real application. As far as electrode materials are concerned, powerful 
supercapacitors electrode materials usually require high electrical conductivity, large specific surface area, fast ion transfer rate, and good 
electrochemical stability [2]. A lot of works have been done to devise 
high performance electrode materials of SCs [3], such as fabrication of 
carbon based composites [4] and doping with heteroatoms [5], etc. For 
instance, Wang and his teamworkers designed the mesoporous NiCo2O4 
directly grown on an ultrafine nickel as electrode materials, and the 
energy density is 77 Wh⋅kg− 1 for the corresponding supercapacitor device with a power density of 35 kW kg− 1
. Hierarchical NiO nanosheets 
were successfully synthesized by Ouyang, and the corresponding 
supercapacitor device based on these NiO nanosheets electrodes materials possessed an energy density of 27.9 Wh⋅kg− 1 with a power density 
of 0.38 kW kg− 1 [6]. Although the electrode materials mentioned above 
have great advantages, they generally showed some disadvantages such 
as inferior rate capability, poor electrical conductivity, and complex 
production procedures [7]. Consequently, rational design of transition 
metal based high-performance SCs is still a huge challenge for scientific 
researchers. 
The oxides/hydroxides based on transition metal (such as Co(OH)2, 
NiO, MnO2), have high specific capacitance owing to the reversible 
faradaic redox reactions [8–12]. On the contrary, their poor electrical 
conductivity results in their weak rate characteristics. Recently, layered 
double hydroxides (LDH) were widely investigated as electrodes for

supercapacitors due to their high theoretical capacitance, inexpensive 
cost, environmental friendliness, as well as natural abundance [13–15]. 
However, the relevant research progress is not satisfactory. For example, 
the specific capacitance of the nickel/cobalt layered double hydroxides 
with 3D cluster structure possess 1887.5 F g− 1 of the specific capacitance 
at 1 A g− 1
, while the specific capacitance just keeps 62.8% of its original 
value at 10 A g− 1 [16]. Cobalt-nickel double hydroxides microspheres 
display the highest specific capacitance of 2400 F g− 1 at 1 A g− 1
, yet 
merely 42% of the capacitance retain when the current density gives rise 
to 25 A g− 1 [17]. Thus, in order to enhance the overall properties of 
LDH-based material, it is urgent to improve their conductivity, cyclic 
stability and rate capability. 
To overcome these problems, anion doping as well as oxygen-defect 
creation have aroused widespread interest, because they can modulate 
electronic properties of electrode materials and improve the concentration of electrochemical active sites. As a common way for modifying 
the intrinsic activity of the electrode materials, the fabrication of oxygen 
vacancy can change the electronic structure of the active materials, thus 
improving their activity [18–20]. Therefore, oxygen vacancies are 
widely used in the preparation of high performance electrode materials. 
Liu [21] prepared oxygen-enriched CuCo2O4 nanoflowers electrodes by 
hydrothermal method and heat treatment in a low oxygen atmosphere, 
which possess a high specific capacitance of 1006 F g− 1 at 1 A g− 1 due to 
their big specific surface area and excellent conductivity. Huang [22] 
prepared NiCo2O4 nanoneedle electrode materials with abundant oxygen vacancy based on nickel foam, and the specific capacitance was 
1076 F g− 1 at 0.5 A g− 1
. The energy density of the symmetrical supercapacitor device of NiCo2O4//NiCo2O4 can reach 30.5 Wh⋅kg− 1 when 
the power density is 750 W kg− 1
. 
In this work, a facile electrolytic deposition procedure, following by 
an in situ oxidation process are pronounced to produce NiCo-LDH with 
rich oxygen vacancies (addressed as Ov-NiCo-LDH), which has a high 
specific capacity of 1160 C g− 1 corresponding to 1 A g− 1 and high rate 
capacity (706 C g− 1 at a high current density of 10 A g− 1

morphology on bare nickel foam. At the same time, the content of oxygen vacancy can be dominated by manipulating the time of oxidation. 
The whole synthesis procedure can be finished in a few minutes, which 
illustrates its convenience and wide application. Furthermore, the asfabricated symmetric supercapacitor (SSC) device based on Ov-NiCoLDH electrode exhibited a fascinating electrochemical performance with 
a specific capacitance of 168.90 F g− 1
, and a high energy density of 
216.19 Wh⋅kg− 1 at a power density of 1.69 kW kg− 1

offers a novel way to develop LDH materials with rich oxygen vacancies, 
but also provides an effective electrode design method to ameliorate the 
electrochemical property of energy storage devices. "
01_int.txt,"Co 3 O 4 has been intensely studied for electrochemical energy 
conversion and storage, including as an electrocatalyst for the water oxidation/oxygen evolution reaction 
(OER), [ 1 ] in lithium-ion batteries, [ 2 ] and 
as supercapacitors, [ 3,4 ] due to its excellent 
catalytic properties and high corrosion stability. The low cost and earth abundance 
of Co 3 O 4 have suggested it to be a highly 
promising substitute for rare metal oxidebased catalysts such as RuO 2 and IrO 2 . 
[ 1 ]
As the surface area and electronic states 
of Co 3 O 4 are two of the main contributors 
for its catalytic performance, substantial 
work has been focused on developing new 
synthetic approaches to realize a variety 
of Co 3 O 4 nanostructures with high surface area, [ 5–7 ] dopings [ 8 ] and hybrid materials. [ 9 ] For instance, Co 3 O 4 nanoparticles 
have demonstrated catalytic performances 
that are strongly dependent on the particle 
morphology and surface area. [ 5 ] Additionally, the fabrication of Co 3 O 4 -based nanocomposites, such as doped with Ni, [ 10 ]
Pt, [ 11 ] and interfaced with graphene, [ 1 ] has 
also been demonstrated for enhanced 
catalytic performances, due to the synergistic effect of these co-catalysts. Furthermore, recent theoretical studies suggest that the surface oxygen 
vacancies may provide a unique means for enhancing the electrochemical and catalytic performance of rutile MnO 2 . 
[ 12 ] Nonetheless, the fi ne tuning of surface states and charge densities in 
an undoped, pristine Co 3 O 4 , which may allow for creating more 
electrochemically reactive sites, has achieved limited success. 
 Previously, annealing in a reducing atmosphere such as 
hydrogen was reported as an effective method for post-treatment of TiO 2 and other metal oxides. [ 13–15 ] However, this hightemperature hydrogen annealing approach is not applicable 
for thermally unstable materials and is not practical for energy 
applications, due to the cost and safety issues, as well as the 
substantial consumption of thermal energy and fuel (hydrogen). 
Very recently, a facile method was developed using a NaBH 4
solution for treating TiO 2 nanotubes and BiVO 4 thin fi lms, thus 
leading to photocurrent increase for their photoelectrochemical performances. [ 16,17 ] Although it is remarkably simple, this 
room-temperature solution process only allows for modulation 
of oxygen vacancies on the surface of these oxides, thus limiting the enhancement effect on the device performancescandidates for OER catalysts. When it is formed in a high-surface-area morphology with fast charge transport, Co 3 O 4 may 
serve as an ideal candidate for direct reduction treatment to 
enhance its electrical and catalytic properties. Here, we demonstrate the NaBH 4 treatment of 1D, hydrothermally grown, 
mesoporous Co 3 O 4 nanowires (NWs) for enhanced catalytic 
and electrochemical properties. The mesoporous Co 3 O 4 NWs 
have large surface area, fast mass and charge transfer, and 
direct electrical contact to the supporting conductive substrates, [ 2 ] which allow for effi cient reduction treatment on the 
surface and charge carrier transport ( Figure 1 ). The reduced 
Co 3 O 4 NWs exhibits substantially enhanced electrochemical 
performance in both seven-fold OER activity and three-fold 
supercapacitor capacitance enhancement, compared to the 
pristine Co 3 O 4 NWs. Density-functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the oxygen vacancies create new defect states 
located in the band gap of Co 3 O 4 and thus the two electrons on 
the defect states are easily excited, leading to enhancement of 
the conductivity of Co 3 O 4 . More importantly, the much lower 
vacancy formation energy of Co 3 O 4 than TiO 2 and many other 
metal oxides allows for effi cient formation of oxygen vacancies in Co 3 O 4 with more free electrons, giving rise to the substantially enhanced electrical conductivity and electrochemical 
performance. "
02_int.txt,".The increasing demand for portable and flexible electronics
such as roll-up displays, photovoltaic cells, and wearable.
devices has initiated intensive efforts to explore flexible,
lightweight and environmentally friendly energy storage
devices [1–5]. As a new class of energy storage devices,
flexible supercapacitors (SCs) have attracted much attention as promising energy source for wearable electronics
due to their remarkable advantages such as high power
density and relatively large energy density, fast charge/
discharge capability, light-weight, excellent reliability and
flexibility [2,6,7]. However, for practical applications in the
future, the energy density and operating voltage of flexible
solid-state SCs should be advanced without sacrificing the
power density and life cycle. The energy density (E) of the
SCs can be effectively improved by maximizing the specific
capacitance (C) and/or the cell voltage (V) according to the
equation E=1/2CV2 [8–10]. Developing asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) is emerging as an effective approach to
improve the energy density and operating voltage of SCs, as
they combines the voltage windows of two different electrodes [11,12]. The electrochemical performance of the
ASCs is largely dependent on the properties of the electrode
materials. The combination of appropriate electrode materials working in complementary windows is essential to
achieve high energy density and power density of ASCs.
Carbon-based materials are widely used as anode (power
source), while the pseudocapacitive materials such as metal
oxides and conductive polymers are generally employed as
cathode (energy source). Among various metal oxides, manganese dioxide (MnO2) is an attractive pseudocapacitive
material with high theoretical specific capacitance (1400
F g1
), low cost, natural abundance and environmentally
friendly.[13–15] However, its poor electrical conductivity
(105
–106 S cm1
) severely restricts its practical application as high-performance electrode material for SCs.
In recent years, two major strategies have been developed
to improve the conductivity and capacitance of MnO2
[16–20]. The first one is to fabricate nanostructured MnO2
electrodes with desirable architecture and high surface area
[16,18,20]. The second approach is to combine MnO2 with
highly external conductive materials such as carbon nanotubes, graphene, etc. [6,17,19,21–23]. These MnO2-based
composites generally exhibit enhanced electrochemical performance compared to the pristine MnO2. However, due to
the restriction of the MnO2/conductor interfaces, the
enhancement of MnO2 conductivity by the external conductive reinforcements is still limited [24,25]. Until recently,
Kang et al. reported the remarkably improved conductivity of
MnO2 via atomic doping of Au atom and the Au-doped MnO2
film exhibited enhanced capacitive performance [24]. However, the use of Au may hinder the wide application of the
Au-doped MnO2 electrode. The development of low-cost,
effective and reliable approaches to intrinsically improve the
conductivity and capacitance of MnO2 is still challenging.
In this paper, we report a facile and effective approach to
boost the capacitance of MnO2 by enhancing the intrinsic
conductivity of MnO2 through inducing oxygen vacancies.
Oxygen vacancies are well known to play an important role
in determining the properties of MnO2 [26]. Recent reports
have shown that the introduction of oxygen vacancies into
MnO2 could significantly improve the conductivity and accelerate the kinetics of the surface redox reactions, and thus
enhancing its electrochemical performances [26–28]. For
example, the catalytic activity of MnO2 for the oxygen
reduction reaction (ORR) can be enhanced without introducing
foreign components by generating an oxygen deficiency [28].
On the other hand, hydrogenation treatment has proven
effective to introduce oxygen vacancies into metal oxides
and modify the electrochemical properties of metal oxide
electrode materials [29–31]. We expect that hydrogenation of
MnO2 NRs will substantially increase the density of oxygen
vacancies, and thus significantly improve the conductivity of
the MnO2 NRs as well as the capacitive performance. To prove
this hypothesis, we take the hydrogenated MnO2 (denoted as
H-MnO2) NRs grown on carbon cloth as an example. Electrochemical measurements demonstrated that a large areal
capacitance of 0.22 F cm2 (449 F g1
) was achieved by HMnO2 NRs at a current density of 0.75 mA cm2
, which is
substantially higher those of untreated MnO2 and air treated
MnO2 electrodes. The H-MnO2 NRs also have excellent rate
capability and cycling stability. Moreover, a high-performance
and wearable ASC device with a maximum energy density of
0.25 mWh cm3 was achieved by using the as-prepared
H-MnO2 NRs as cathode and RGO as anode."
03_int.txt,"Supercapacitors (SCs) are becoming a critical member of 
energy storage systems and have been widely used in consumer 
electronics, hybrid electric vehicles, uninterruptable power supplies, and so on.[1–3] SCs can be classified into two categories electrical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) 
where charge is stored by charge separation at the electrode–electrolyte interface, 
and pseudocapacitors that store charge by 
fast Faradic reactions. EDLCs employing 
carbon materials have low capacitance, 
whereas pseudocapacitors utilizing metal 
oxides (NiO, Co3O4, MnO2, and RuO2) 
and conducting polymers exhibit low 
rate capability and short cycle life.[4–10] A 
strategy to overcome these problems is 
to grow or anchor metal oxides or conducting polymers onto carbon-based material to obtain novel composite electrode 
materials, which derive their benefits from 
synergistic effects. Despite the promising 
results and significant progress in this 
field, rational synthesis of such electrode 
materials with controllable conductivity 
and electrochemical activity is still the topical challenge for high-performance SCs.
The Co3O4/graphene composites have 
become a highly promising electrode 
material for high-performance SCs,[11,12]
in which Co3O4 has a high theoretical-specific capacitance (3560 F g−1
), low cost, and great reversibility, 
while the graphene sheets offer excellent electron conductive 
routes, ultralarge-specific surface area, and superior intrinsic 
mechanical strength. Many approaches are available for fabricating the Co3O4/graphene composites for the charge-storage 
performance. Dong et al. and Liao et al. reported that the Co3O4/graphene hybrids were in situ synthesized by a simple 
hydrothermal procedure, which delivers a high-specific capacitance and exhibits an excellent cycling stability.[12,13] Zou et al. 
synthesized mesoporous Co3O4 nanosheets on graphene foam 
through the electrodeposition and annealing process, in which 
the 3D hierarchical structure and the synergetic effect of Co3O4
and graphene enhance the rate of ion and electron transport 
in electrodes.[14] Chen and Wang prepared a Co3O4/graphene 
nanostructures by the microwave irradiation method, which 
is used as the electrode for lithium ion batteries and shows an 
excellent rate capability and highly reversible large capacity.[15]
Unfortunately, there are only a few reports about the preparation of ultrafine Co3O4 nanoparticles on graphene,[16,17] which 
are considered as one of the most optimal structures for 
high-performance SCs due to a high utilization rate of pseudocapacitive materials (Co3O4) and a short transport length of 
electrolyte ions and electrons in the composites.[18,19] Also, the 
in situ synthesis of such composite nanostructure with ultrafine 
Co3O4 nanoparticles, high conductive graphene, and tight coupling between those two remains challenging, and there are 
still somewhat limited (e.g., complicated process, pollution 
of organic additives). What’s more, controlling the intrinsic 
conductivity of Co3O4 nanoparticles and their electrochemical activity is another great challenge in promoting the SCs 
performance.
In recent years, intentional creation of oxygen vacancies (VO) 
has been explored to improve the intrinsic conductivity and 
electrochemical activity of transition metal oxides, and thus 
to increase their SCs performance,[20–22] where oxygen vacancies (VO) can change the geometric and electronic structures 
as well as the chemical properties of transition metal oxides. 
However, owing to the limitations of synthetic methods (e.g., 
chemical reduction, gas reduction, etc.),[19,20,23–29] metal oxides 
with abundant oxygen vacancies, especially for ultrafine metal 
oxides nanoparticles/graphene composites, have been rarely 
fabricated. Thus, an innovative protocol is necessary for developing a unique ultrafine metal oxides nanoparticles/graphene 
nanostructure, in which appropriate oxygen vacancies in metal 
oxide were created.
Herein, we proposed a novel one-step laser irradiation route 
through simultaneous laser-induced reduction and fragmentation to prepare oxygen-vacancy abundant and ultrafine Co3O4
nanoparticles/graphene (UCNG) composites with high rate 
capability (93.7%) for the first time. Without introducing any 
reducing agents and organic additives, ultrafine Co3O4 nanoparticles (≈10 nm) anchoring on graphene were obtained. Under 
laser irradiation, the graphene oxide (GO) was reduced to high 
conductive graphene through photothermal effects, accompanied the fragmentation (size reduction) of the porous Co3O4
nanorods (P-Co3O4). More importantly, abundant oxygen vacancies were created on the ultrafine Co3O4 nanoparticles surface 
and the Co3O4 nanoparticles tightly anchored on the graphene, 
which significantly modifies the electric conductivity and the 
electrochemical activity of Co3O4 nanoparticles and hence 
enables the UCNG electrode with fast and reversible Faradaic 
reactions. The ultrafine Co3O4 nanoparticles/graphene composites are the promising candidates as the supercapacitor electrode. The capacitance of the composites reached 978.1 F g−1
(135.8 mA h g−1
) at the current densities of 1 A g−1. It shows 
high rate capability, with more than 93.7% capacitance retention at even 10 A g−1
. The superior performance also benefits 
from the surface midgap electronic states, which are enhanced 
by oxygen vacancies (VO) and facilitate the electrochemical 
charge transfer, as shown by our first-principles calculations. 
The discovery in our paper not only establish a new route to 
prepare the Co3O4/graphene composites and shed light on 
their formation mechanism, but also opens a new avenue for 
realizing high-performance SCs electrodes, especially for rate 
capability"
04_int.txt,"Semiconducting metal oxides have been extensively studied as
functional materials for wide applications relating to sustainable development, such as energy conversion/storage, environmental remediation and high-performance electronics [1–8]. As a wide-band-gap
semiconductor (~ 3.3 eV) with unique optical and electrical properties,
ZnO has attracted tremendous interest in the fields of photocatalysis,
sensors, solar cells, supercapacitors, etc. [9–12]. when compared to
other semiconductor materials, ZnO is also industrially important due
to its ease of synthesis, nontoxicity and relatively low cost. Recently,
the emerging nanotechnology has provided new opportunities for
tuning the nano and mesoscale structures of ZnO in order to extend its
applications. For instance, the engineering of ZnO nanostructures with
controlled dimension, size, porosity, crystal facets and mesoscale architectures have achieved great success in improving their performance
for various applications [13–17]. However, ZnO has some intrinsic
limitations in optical and electrical properties that cannot be solved by
morphology engineering. On the one hand, the wide-band-gap of ZnO
limits its optical absorption to the ultraviolet (UV) region. The lack of
visible-light absorption limits its performance when used as photocatalysts, antibacterial agents and photoelectrodes, since UV light only
accounts for less than 5% of the entire solar energy radiation [18,19].
On the other hand, poor electronic property is another common problem for pristine metal oxide [5,8]. For example, the short lifetime of
photogenerated carriers set a huge limit for the efficiency of photocatalysts and photoelectrodes [20,21]; and the low conductivity of
pristine ZnO is also not favorable for its wider applications in various
electronics. To solve these problems, various strategies such as doping
with transition metal ions or nonmetal ions [22–25], coupling with
other semiconductors [26–28] and functionalization with noble metals
[29–31] or nanocarbon materials, etc. [32–34], have been employed. It
is now common knowledge that the modifications of the optical and
electrical properties of ZnO nanomaterials are the key factors to enhance their performances.
In particular, a novel strategy has been developed to modify electronic and optical properties of ZnO nanomaterials by creating intrinsic
defects. Controlled introduction of these intrinsic defects into metal
oxides can manipulate their donor densities and band structures, and
thus, their optical and electronic properties [5,8]. Among all the defects identified in ZnO, oxygen vacancy (VO) has been recognized as one of
the most important and is supposed to be the prevalent defect in many
metal oxides [35–41]. Extensive theoretical and experimental works
have been carried out on VO in ZnO, and it has been demonstrated that
various physical and chemical properties including the electronic
structure, charge transport, optical and surface properties of ZnO are
closely related to VO. For instance, VO generally results in the occurrence of isolated energy levels [42–44], which significantly enhance the
optical absorption, charge generation and separation. Moreover, the VO
on the ZnO surfaces act as the active sites, which are involved in the
surface adsorption and reaction processes [45–48]. For these reasons,
there is a great interest in the development of controllable synthesis of
ZnO nanomaterials with VO and exploiting their unique properties and
potential applications.
In this review, we would like to summarize the recent research
progress on the ZnO nanomaterials with VO. The synthetic approaches
to ZnO nanomaterials with VO are summarized in Section 2, and we
have tried to categorize the reported methods according to the mechanisms of VO generation. The structural characteristics, band structure, optical, electrical and ferromagnetic properties of ZnO nanomaterials with VO are briefly summarized in Section 3. Then we reviewed
their various applications for photocatalysts, photoelectrodes, antibacterial agents, gas sensors, supercapacitors and some other electronic
devices. Finally, we discuss the current challenges and potential future
opportunities of VO-rich ZnO nanomaterials. It is hoped that this review
can provide a useful source for engineering of defects in metal oxide
nanomaterials with tunable properties, and to expand their functional
applications."
05_int.txt,"Supercapacitors are being increasingly investigated as a viable
charge storage technology. They are classified into three general
groups based on their charging mechanism: non-faradic supercapacitors (electric double layer capacitors (ELDCs)),1 faradic
supercapacitors (pseudocapacitors),1,2 and hybrid supercapacitors.3 So far, different types of carbon, such as carbon
nanotubes, carbon aerogels, and activated carbon,4–6 as well as
transition metals, such as Ru,1,2 Ni,6 Mn,1 and their oxides, have
been employed as active materials in the fabrication of supercapacitor electrodes. Over the last decade, titania (TiO2) has been
investigated for use as a supercapacitor electrode material due to
its semiconducting properties and chemical stability.7–17 It is wellknown that high surface area,2 high conductivity,6,18 and interconnectivity of the active material will strongly enhance the
capacitance properties. Recently, TiO2 nanotube arrays have
attracted much attention in charging storage systems because of
their capacity to offer high surface area and greatly improved
electron transfer pathways compared with non-oriented structures, which favour higher charge propagation in active
materials.16,18–23 Anodic oxidation of titanium foil, extensively
studied,24–26 offers a convenient way to achieve highly ordered
and suitably back-connected titania nanotube layers on the
substrate, so that the combination can be used directly as
a binder-free supercapacitor electrode. The highly ordered
material structure offers the advantages of (i) more direct
transport pathways uninterrupted by interparticle connections
and (ii) the possibility to form surface electrical fields, which
should reduce recombination by confining the injected electrons
to the central zone of the tubes.18
In terms of charging mechanism, it has been mostly suggested
that TiO2 only contributes a very low non-faradic capacitance
and almost no faradic capacitance.27–29 In general, titania
capacitors would resemble conventional electric double layer
capacitors, which act by a non-faradic mechanism with a very
low specific capacitance of 10–40 mF cm2 in the charge–
discharge process. It is widely believed that bare titania, due to
high electric resistance and low specific surface area, shows low
electrochemical capacitance. However, it has been reported that
decreasing the particle size of TiO2 to less than 10 nm results in
pseudocapacitive behaviour of the resultant material,
allowing for an increase in the capacitance of anatase of up to 90–
120 mF cm2
.

There are many approaches which can lead the way to overcome electrical resistivity, such as electrochemical18,31 and
thermal treatments.18,19 Changes in electrical properties can also
be attributed to changes in crystallinity.16,17,19 To the best of the
authors’ knowledge, highly ordered three-dimensional networks
of TiO2 nanotubes have only been used as a support to fabricate
composite electrodes for electrochemical capacitor applications.16,22 The properties of metal oxides at nanoscale, especially
TiO2, are very sensitive to oxygen content in the lattice and the
related non-stoichiometry. So far, little is known about the
effects of oxygen non-stoichiometry on capacitance properties.
The properties of non-stoichiometric oxides are more strongly
affected by their defect disorder rather than by their structure. he most common procedure applied in the modification of nonstoichiometry and its related properties involve doping with
cations and anions, among which oxygen is an important dopant
for metal oxides.32,33
This paper presents the effects of different heat-treatment
routes on capacitance, crystallinity, oxygen deficiency, and the
electrical properties of titania nanotubes prepared by anodic
oxidation."
06_int.txt,"Increasing energy demands and environment pollution have stimulated intense research on developing renewable, sustainable and
clean energy sources, as well as new technologies associated energy
storage and conversion systems. Hydrogen, with high mass-specific
energy density, is considered as one of the most promising substitutes
for fossil fuels [1,2]. The most efficient way to generate hydrogen is
water splitting driven by electricity or solar energy [3,4]. Oxygen
evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are
the two half reactions of water splitting, both of which are vital for the
overall efficiency of water splitting [5]. Especially, OER is the kinetically determining step and requires high overpotentials to drive the
four-electron oxidation process [6]. Although the catalysts based on
noble metals, such as Ru and Pt, demonstrate favorable water splitting
performances, the limited resources and high cost hinder their
practical applications [7,8]. Therefore, the discovery of effective and
low-cost electrocatalysts for OER and HER lies at the heart of the
development of advanced energy technologies, not only for water
splitting, but also for fuel cells and metal-air batteries actually.
Lithium-ion batteries and supercapacitors are promising candidates
for energy storage devices, and both rely on electrochemical processes
[9]. At this stage, they also face some challenges, such as limited
lifespan, low energy density or power density. Similarly, their performances intimately depend on the properties of electrode materials.
Overall, innovative materials hold the key to new generations of energy
technologies.
Recently, electrode materials based on transition metals have
attracted significant attention, due to their abundant resources, multiple oxidation states and ability to myriad of electrochemical reactions
[10–13]. However, the large intrinsic electrical resistance impedes
their practical applications greatly. Numerous efforts have been
employed to improve their electrochemical performances. For example,
introducing oxygen vacancies [14] or heteroatoms [15–17] in transtion metal oxides have been reported to enhance the electrical
conductivity and therefore boost the capacitive performances. The
development of nanostructured materials with desirable morphologies
has boosted the electrode properties effectively, in term of the enlarged
electroactive surface area, shortened diffusion pathway of ion/electron
and capability of balancing stresses induced by cyclic volumetric
variation [18]. Nanostructured materials with well-defined crystal
plane structures show enhanced electrochemical properties, especially
the rate capability [19]. This is because crystal planes with higher
energy could reduce the oxidation-reduction gaps and then accelerate
reaction rates. In addition, adjusting grain sizes and phases properly
could contribute to enhanced performances [20]. However, complex
processing methods and sophisticated techniques are limited factors.
Thus, to develop simple and universal strategies is still urgent for
comprehensively enhancing the electrochemical performances.
Among various transition metal oxides, Co3O4 has attracted extensive attention due to its high energy storage capacity (3560 F g−1
),
low-cost, environmental friendliness, multiple valence sites as well as
high activity in water oxidation [21,22]. Nonetheless, Co3O4 shares the
common drawbacks of low electrical conductivity, which highly restricts its performances in energy storage and conversion. Also, the
OER activity of Co3O4 should be further promoted for high efficiency
water-splitting. It has been reported that calcination temperature can
tune the surface components, such as the valance ratio of different
metals in CoxNi1−xOy reported by Roginskaya et al. [23], and oxygen
vacancies in Ce-Fe mixed oxides performed by Li et al. [24].
Herein, we report that the surface components and defects of
electrode materials can be tuned by means of facilely controlling the
calcination temperature, and thus enhance the electrochemical performances. Cobalt oxide acts as a model material to illustrate how this
strategy effectively improves supercapacitive performances and electrocatalytic performances for water splitting. Specifically, we harvested
highly active Co3O4 porous nanorods for electrochemical energy
storage and catalysis through controllable CoC2O4·2H2O conversion.
Oxygen vacancies have been successfully introduced into Co3O4
nanorods which have largely increased the donor density for higher
electrical conductivity. In addition, electrophilic O2
2-/O- species is
functionalized on the surface and is believed to boost the OER activity
[25]. The cobalt oxide calcined at 250 °C shows high specific capacitance (739 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1
), long durability (no degradation of the
overall capacitance after 50000 cycles), high OER activity (overpotential of 275 mV at 10 mA cm−2
), good stability for 300 h as well as good
HER activity. Moreover, an integrated electrolyzer for overall water
splitting can be driven by asymmetric supercapacitors with the
optimized cobalt oxide as both electrocatalysts and positive electrode
materials of the supercapacitors."
07_int.txt,"Transitional metal oxide materials have been deemed as
promising candidates to be used as electrodes of energy storage
devices on account of their abundant reserves, environmental
geniality, easy approachability and other intriguing characteristics; for instance, their diverse constituents and morphologies, large surface area and high theoretical specic
capacitance.1–3 In addition, they play a central part in the electrodes of electrochemical supercapacitors, and offer a conspicuous capacitance improvement by adjusting and controlling
their defects and surface/interfaces under a certain nanoscale.4,5
Though their energy density has shown an enhancement to
a certain degree, their low electrical conductivity, uncontrollable volume expansion and sluggish ions diffusion in the bulk
phase have hindered their practical applications.6–9 Hence, it is
of utmost importance and urgency to explore functional metal
oxide materials with improved electrochemical properties.
The design of metal oxide materials in terms of their
composition, the fabrication of novel nanostructures, their
electroconductivity and oxygen vacancies have boosted the
physical and chemical performances of metal oxides, regarding
their electrical conductivity, specic surface area, electro-active
sites and chemical stability. First of all, the co-existence of two
different cations in a single crystal structure could produce
more electrons than single metal oxides, which leads to the
improvement in the electrical conductivity. For instance, spinel
NiCo2O4 materials possess electrical conductivity two or three
orders of magnitude higher than the corresponding single
metal oxide NiO or Co3O4 materials.10 Also, the doping of a Ni
element enhances the electrical conductivity from 3.1  105
(Co3O4) to 0.1–0.3 S cm1 (NixCo3xO4).11 Moreover, another
metal doping affords original single metal oxide materials with
extra redox reactions and reduces the charge transfer impedance for electrochemical supercapacitors, in which the specic
capacitance is signicantly larger than that of original single
metal oxide materials without the cost of fast charging–discharging kinetics. Second, in comparison with bulk metal oxide
materials, novel nanostructured metal oxides are usually porous
and can provide a higher surface specic area, which is
conducive to the inltration of the electrodes, full contact
between the active materials and electrolyte, the transportation
of ions in the electrolytes and the utilization of the active
materials at high rate charging–discharging.12–15 In addition,
the satisfactory electro-active sites, and chemical and highthermal stabilities of the metal oxide materials guarantee
high pseudo-capacitive performances and cyclic stability. Third,
increasing number of metal oxide/C composites have been reported, including carbon nanotubes, carbon nanobers, graphene and amorphous carbon materials, which have
dramatically improved electroconductivity and further enhanced specic capacitance and rate performances.16–19
Fourth, the introduction of oxygen vacancies into metal oxides
leads to a larger interlayer spacing, which promotes faster
charge storage kinetics with an intercalation pseudocapacitive
behaviour. For example, the intercalation pseudocapacitive
charge storage for MoO3x is two times larger than that for
MoO3.
20
On account of the above unique features, the use of metal
oxides has led to breakthroughs for pseudo-supercapacitors and
has gradually ameliorated the energy density at the battery level
without sacricing traditional capacitor power delivery, which
bridges the gap between batteries and capacitors. Compared
with bulk metal oxide materials with inferior specic surface
area and capacitive performances, the growing trend to design
and fabricate novel porous nanostructures and composites with
carbon materials is desirable to increase the surface specic
area and to achieve excellent electrochemical properties.
Subsequently, the development of various devices, such as
asymmetric supercapacitors (aqueous or non-aqueous systems),
hybrid supercapacitors, including Li-ion hybrid supercapacitors,
Na-ion hybrid supercapacitors and other novel hybrid supercapacitors and solid-state asymmetric supercapacitors have been
reported, particularly the vital parameters inuencing the energy
density of the devices. Therefore, it has been seen that the
assembled asymmetric supercapacitors with porous bimetallic
oxide/C materials can deliver a competitive energy density of
about 80 W h kg1
, approaching that of commercial lithium-ion
batteries (at the same power).21 Besides, assembling asymmetric
supercapacitors in non-aqueous solutions could offer a wider
working voltage window of about 3 V, further pushing the energy
density to the 100 W h kg1 level. Also, the combination of high
energy and power has been successfully realized in hybrid
asymmetric supercapacitor systems, particularly Li-ion or Na-ion
hybrid systems.22–24
Hence, in this tutorial review, we present the recent developments in metal oxide-based supercapacitors in detail, highlighting their importance in high energy-density integrated
supercapacitors. The basic principles of the metal oxide materials and the innovative progress in multifarious supercapacitor
devices have been covered intensively. Re-reading the recent
literature could probably help in the understanding of this area,
and reveal the future prospects for the development of
supercapacitors."
08_int.txt,"Anodic TiO2 nanotube arrays have attracted considerable attention due to their 
remarkable functionalities in light harvesting [1-3], electrochromic switching [4], 
environmental sensing [5], energy storage devices [6,7], etc. Particularly,
one-dimensional TiO2 nanotube arrays fabricated by anodization of titanium (Ti) have 
been extensively investigated as a promising electrode material for supercapacitors
because of their high surface area, excellent chemical stability and wide potential 
window. Furthermore, this vertically oriented TiO2 nanotube arrays provide a direct
pathway for electron transport along the long axis of nanotubes to the Ti foil substrate
and can be employed directly as a supercapacitor electrode. However, the pristine 
(without intentional doping or modification) TiO2 nanotube arrays generally suffer
from poor capacitive behavior, since TiO2 is a wide bandgap semiconductor (3.2 eV 
for anatase and 3.0 eV for rutile) [8] with a limited conductivity. Therefore, 
substantial improvement in conductivity of TiO2 is needed for supercapacitor
electrode materials. It is known that an increase in electrical conductivity of TiO2 can 
be achieved through introducing metal [9] or nonmetal impurities [10] into the oxide, 
which can generate donor or acceptor states in the bandgap and thereby increase the 
concentration of charge carriers. Consequently, numerous research efforts concerning
the doping or modification of TiO2 material have been made. For instance, Nakamura 
et al. [11] prepared plasma-treated TiO2 powders by radio-frequency discharge under 
2 Torr H2 at 673 K. The photocatalytic activity for NO removal appeared in the visible
light region up to 600 nm after treating the TiO2 powders in the hydrogen plasma.
They attributed the improved photocatalytic activity of the plasma-treated TiO2
powders to the newly formed oxygen vacancy states between the valence and the 
conduction bands in the TiO2 band structure. Schmuki et al. [12] indicated that TiO2
nanotube arrays could be converted to a highly conductive phase by a 
high-temperature treatment in acetylene. The as-prepared C-doped TiO2 nanotube 
arrays showed semimetallic conductivity, which could be used as a highly efficient 
support for electrocatalytic reactions. Recently, Lu et al. [13] have shown that 
hydrogenation can improve significantly the electrochemical performance of TiO2 as 
electrode materials for supercapacitors. The hydrogenated TiO2 electrodes were 
obtained by calcination of anodic TiO2 nanotube arrays in hydrogen atmosphere at
high temperatures. They found that TiO2 nanotube arrays hydrogenated at 400 °C
achieved the highest specific capacitances (i.e., capacitance per unit planar area) of
3.24 mF cm-2 at a scan rate of 100 mV s-1 with excellent rate capability and long-term 
stability. They suggested that the enhanced capacitive performance could be ascribed 
to the combined contribution from the improved donor (oxygen vacancy) density and 
the increased density of surface hydroxyl groups of TiO2 nanotube arrays.
However, it is worth noting that the above-mentioned doping or treatment methods 
were realized by using either expensive facilities [11], or high processing 
temperatures [12,13], or a long duration process [13]. For practical applications, a
simple and fast approach to modification of TiO2 for improved electrochemical 
properties is highly desirable. In fact, TiO2 can also be modified at ambient 
temperature by electrochemical doping processes [2,3,14,15]. For example, Schmuki 
and coworkers [15] have developed a reductive doping process to form a more 
conductive layer at the bottom of TiO2 nanotubes (i.e., the barrier layer). In the doping 
process, the Ti4+ ions at the nanotube barrier layer can be reduced to Ti3+ ions (Ti4+O2
+ e- + H+ → Ti3+(O)(OH)). The presence of Ti3+ dopant as a donor center results in a
high-conductivity barrier layer. Based on a similar reductive doping technique, a
high-quality tube-in-tube structure (copper and nickel nanotubes embedded in TiO2
nanotubes) has been fabricated in our recent work, demonstrating enhanced solar cell 
performance [2]. More recently, we tried to detach the TiO2 nanotube film from the Ti 
foil substrates by utilizing the impact of H2 evolution, which was generated when the 
TiO2 nanotube film was biased to enough negative potentials for the hydrogen
evolution reaction. Although the experimental attempt has failed, the color of the TiO2
nanotube film was found to become darker during H2 evolution. This color change 
was reminiscent of black hydrogenated TiO2 nanocrystals [16], which motivated us to 
explore the electrochemical properties of the TiO2 nanotube films treated via H2
evolution processing. On the basis of the experimental results, we developed a facile,
fast and low-cost electrochemical hydrogenation doping method to enhance 
electrochemical performances of TiO2 nanotube films. The capacitive properties of
TiO2 nanotube films show a substantial enhancement after the electrochemical 
hydrogenation, which are well beyond those previously reported [13,17,18]. More 
interestingly, the degradation of performance for the TiO2 nanotube electrodes after 
cycling can be readily recovered by the same doping process, which makes it possible
to fabricate a renewable supercapacitor whose performances can be reversibly 
restored."
09_int.txt,"With the flourishing development of portable electronics and hybrid
electric vehicles, it is an ever-increasing demand to design and exploit
high-performance energy storage devices which possess high energy/
power density without bringing any environmental risk [1–4]. Supercapacitors have high power density, superlong lifespan (> 105 cycles),
fast charge/discharge rates, environmental friendliness and excellent
reliability, rendering them a highly promising candidate for next-generation high-efficient energy storage devices [5,6]. However, the relatively lower energy density compared with rechargeable batteries seriously hinders their further commercial applications [7,8], which is an
age-old conundrum and need to be urgently addressed. Tremendous
research effort has been devoted to increasing the energy density of
supercapacitors without sacrificing their intrinsic high power density
and long cycle life in recent years [9–11]. In light of the equation of
energy density (E = 0.5CV2
), the energy density (E) of supercapacitors
could be enhanced through increasing either operating voltage (V) or
specific capacitance (C) governed by both anodes and cathodes [7]. As
an attractive and promising approach, fabrication of asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) has recently drawn intensive attention due to the
greatly widened operation voltage (up to 2.7 V) [12–14]. In this end,
considerable research has been focused on design of advanced anodes
and cathodes with high specific capacitance for ASCs [15,16]. Despite
the tremendous achievement in cathodes with high-performances, the
energy density of ASCs is still seriously impeded by the low specific
capacitance of anodes. At present, commonly used anodes, various
porous carbon materials with high specific surface area, store charge
based on the electric-double layer capacitance mechanism, whose
specific capacitance is much lower than pseudocapacitance [7]. In this
regard, it is highly desirable to explore novel anode materials with high
pseudocapacitance for ASCs to meet the demand of high-performance
energy storage device in future commercialization.
Various pseudocapacitive materials such as MoO3, Fe2O3, V2O5,
Bi2O3 and VN are regarded as promising candidates for anodes of ASCs
[5,15,17], thus they have been investigated actively in recent years
owing to their much higher specific capacitance compared with porous
carbon materials. Among them, molybdenum oxide (MoO3) has attracted numerous interest as a promising anode material for ASCs due
to its low cost, nontoxicity, high electrochemical activity, environmentally benign nature, and a relatively large negative redox
potential window in neutral aqueous electrolytes with high stability
[5]. Particularly, α-MoO3 possesses a layered orthorhombic structure
composed of stacked two layers of MoO6 octahedra with van der Waals
forces in the [010] direction [18], allowing for rapid intercalation and
deintercalation of ions in between the crystal layers without structural
collapse. Thus it holds great promise for ASC applications. However,
previously reported MoO3 materials usually suffer from low specific
capacitance and fast deterioration of performance due to the insufficient electrochemical active sites and low electrochemical activity
of the surfaces [19]. Various MoO3 with different nanostructures have
been prepared in recent years to increase the surface area to enhance
pseudocapacitance [17,20]. Nevertheless, the improvement in pseudocapacitive performance of MoO3 through solely increasing the surface
area is not satisfactory owing to the low electrochemical activity of
surface with limited electrochemical active sites. Introduction of
oxygen vacancies could tremendously improve the electrical conductivity and electrochemical activity of MoO3, where oxygen vacancies could act as shallow donors and consequently increase the free
carrier concentration as well as generate more exposed electrochemical
active sites [21,22]. This in turn results in fast charge storage kinetics
and high pseudocapacitance [22]. Thus introduction of oxygen vacancies through custom tailoring of the surface reactivity with defect
engineering is a highly promising approach to achieve excellent pseudocapacitive performance for MoO3-x with favorable surface and conductivity [23]. Despite the layered structure of the MoO3-x providing
the electrolyte ions with unimpeded highway [24], the charge transfer
between adjacent MoO3-x nano units still remains to be the main obstacle to further improving its high-rate performance since α-MoO3 is a
typical d° oxide with a band gap of 3.1 eV, giving rise to relatively poor

electrical conductivity (10−7 S cm−1) [24,25]. Therefore, it is an efficient approach to build up a three-dimensional (3D) interconnected
conductive network among numerous MoO3-x nano units to facilitate
the rapid transfer of electrons during rapid charge/discharge process,
ensuring excellent electrical conductivity and high-rate performance.
The intrinsic unparalleled electrical conductivity of graphene and
carbon nanotubes renders them promising substrates for the deposition
of MoO3-x nanoparticles.
On the other hand, on account of the water electrolysis, aqueous
electrolytes usually suffer from a narrow operation voltage window of
~1 V [12,26,27]. The operation voltage window of an ASC is closely
correlated with the work function of both anode and cathode materials
[27]. As a consequence, the operation voltage window of ASCs could be
further maximized through choosing suitable anode and cathode materials with the largest work function difference between them in safe
neutral aqueous electrolytes [27]. Among all of the cathode materials
commonly used in neutral aqueous electrolytes, MnO2 (4.4 eV) has the
largest work function difference with MoO3 (6.9 eV) [27]. In this end,
MnO2 should be the most ideal cathode material for ASCs with MoO3
anode material to achieve the maximum operation voltage window in
neutral electrolytes.
Inspired by the above considerations, herein, we demonstrate a
novel approach to prepare oxygen vacancy-rich α-MoO3-x nanobelts
through defect engineering to increase the electrochemical reactivity of
surface. The introduction of oxygen vacancies leads to larger interlayer
spacing and enhanced electrical conductivity, enabling faster charge
storage kinetics, more electrochemical active sites and higher electrochemical reaction activity. As a consequence, the specific capacity is
significantly improved compared with pristine α-MoO3. In order to
further improve the electrical conductivity, α-MoO3-x nanosheets are
anchored in-between graphene nanomesh/carbon nanotube (CNT)
composite (GC) to prepare GC/MoO3-x nanocomposite. The resultant
GC/MoO3-x nanocomposite exhibits high gravimetric specific capacity
of 307 C g−1 and volumetric capacity up to 692 C cm−3 at 1 A g−1 as
well as outstanding rate performance with a retention ratio of 66% at
20 A g−1. Furthermore, an ASC device has been fabricated with GC/
MnO2 and GC/MoO3-x nanocomposites as the cathode and anode, respectively, to evaluate the practical feasibility. Our fabricated ASC
device exhibits an ultrahigh gravimetric energy density of
150 Wh kg−1, corresponding to the volumetric energy density of
319 Wh L−1. The maximum volumetric energy density is highly comparable with and even higher than those of the previously reported
ASCs in aqueous electrolytes. Particularly, our ASC exhibit remarkable
cycling stability along with 101% capacity retention after 30,000 cycles
at 200 mV s−1. This work sheds new light on the development of highly
electrochemical active electrode materials through defect engineering
for energy storage and conversion system"
10_int.txt,"With the development of portable electronic devices and hybrid
electric vehicles, high-capacity and quick-charging energy storage devices have been expected to satisfy people’s needs poorly [1,2]. Supercapacitor, as a popular energy storage device, is gaining attention as
a complement to batteries because of its advantages, such as outstanding power density, high efficiency and excellent cycling stability
[3,4]. Metal oxides, such as MnO2 [5,6], V2O5 [7], Co3O4 [8], NiCo2O4
[9], usually have such advantages as large theoretical specific capacitance, low-cost and excellent cycling performance. However, these
materials also suffer poor intrinsic conductivity and relatively poor
contact performance which hinder them from reaching a high energy
density and large scale application [10–12]. Hence, many studies have
been concentrated on methods of increasing the specific surface area or
synthesizing novel porous nanostructures to enhance the capacitance
and to improve the conductivity for these materials [13–15]. These
efforts have provided some novel methods that have wide application and obtain good improvements [16–19]. However, before these lowcost metal oxides can be successfully applied to commercial supercapacitor, it still has a long way to study for researcher.
Recently, several studies have reported a strategy of increasing the
content of oxygen vacancies in metal oxides to enhance their electrochemical performance [20–27]. Because this strategy can provide better
adsorption ability of H2O molecules and improve the conductivity, it
has been used in the field of photoluminescence [28], water oxidation
electro-catalyst [29], and photoelectron chemical water splitting
[30,31]. Obviously, this strategy can also be used in supercapacitor.
There are three advantages to introducing the oxygen vacancies in
metal oxides. First, the appropriate content of oxygen vacancies in
metal oxides can help the diffusion for charge carriers. Thus, compared
with perfect-crystal metal oxides, the metal oxides with appropriate
vacancies not only have better conductivity but also have higher capacitance [26,32–35]. Second, the surface oxygen vacancies may provide better adsorption of OH− [36,37]. Third, the oxygen vacancies
serve as active sites for redox reactions and the kinetics of surface reactions can be accelerated. For instance, Zhai et al. also improved the
capacitance of MnO2 nanorods by using this strategy [21]. Wang et al.
synthesized reduced mesoporous Co3O4 nanowires as an efficient
electrode material for both electro-catalysts and super-capacitors. Increasing the oxygen vacancies in a material not only decreases its resistance but also increases its capacitance [22]. However, the effects of
oxygen vacancies in NiCo2O4 are rarely reported in the field of supercapacitors. NiCo2O4 is a promising candidate to replace RuO2 and IrO2
in supercapacitor because of its high theoretical capacitance, low cost
and non-toxicity [38], but it is usually limited by poor electron transfer.
As an oxygen scavenger, strong reducing property of NaBH4 is in favor
of removing the oxygen atoms from the surface of NiCo2O4 [39]. CoeO
bonds and NieO bonds lost oxygen atoms, the electrons that previously
occupied the oxygen 2p orbit got close to Co3+, Ni2+ and the O atoms,
which would increase the degree of electron delocalization from the
pristine situation [18]. By changing the concentration of NaBH4, the
content of the oxygen vacancies can be tailored easily, which is safer
than the hydrogenation method for increasing oxygen vacancies. When
NiCo2O4 is treated with NaBH4, NaBH4 can not only increase the active
site on the surface of electrode, but also accelerate charge transfer.
To reveal the influences of oxygen vacancies in the most promising
NiCo2O4 structure, two sets of in situ control experiments were performed. We prepared NiCo2O4 nanosheets electrodes and NiCo2O4 nanowires electrodes through electro-deposition and hydrothermal
method, respectively. They were then reduced with the different concentration of NaBH4 solution to change the content of oxygen vacancies. As expected, as-treated nanosheets and nanowires electrodes
exhibit higher Faradaic capacity than the pristine electrodes. The capacitance of the nanosheets electrode is increased from 898 F g−1 to
1590 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 after the reducing process in 0.5 M NaBH4 solution. Meanwhile, the capacitance of the nanowires electrode increased
from 610 F g−1 to 1248 F g−1
. The results of two sets of experiments
also demonstrate that the optimal electrode materials possess lower
electron transfer resistance and good electrochemical stability after the
reduction process. In comparison, the 0.5-NiCo2O4 NS-vac electrode
shows better capacitive behaviors than the 0.5-NiCo2O4 NW-vac electrode."
11_int.txt,"Electrochemical energy storage devices, such as high-energy 
Li-ion batteries and high-power electrochemical capacitors 
(also called supercapacitors, SCs), have appeared to be highly 
critical components for utilization of renewable but intermittent energy resources (e.g., sunlight, wind, tide).[1–5] The charge 
storage of the former involves mass transfer toward bulk phase, 
and thus is able to achieve large capacity and high energy density. However, the charge storage toward bulk phase is limited 
by ion diffusion process since the ion diffusion in solid is generally seven orders lower than that in liquid phase.[6,7] In contrast, SCs store energy either on the electrode surface ion adsorption/desorption, or in the near 
surface region via insertion/deinsertion 
accompanied with redox reactions, leading 
to higher power response and longer cycle 
life.[8,9] Nevertheless, SCs suffer from 
low energy density due to limited charge 
storage at the surface region. Current 
efforts are mainly devoted to reducing the 
trade-off between the high energy density 
and the low power capability for SCs.[10,11]
Nanostructuring of electrode materials 
has been demonstrated to be an effective 
strategy to shorten ion diffusion length 
and improve the energy density at high 
power.[12–15] For example, Dunn and coworkers[12] reported the fast Li+ intercalation into mesoporous and nanocrystal 
films of orthorhombic Nb2O5, which 
delivered a capacity of ≈40 mA h g−1
 at 
high scan rate of 500 mV s−1
. Naoi and 
co-workers[14] prepared nanocrystalline 
Li3VO4 dispersed within carbon nanotubes for fast charging and discharging in 
seconds, which exhibited more than 50% capacity retention at 
a high current density of 20 A g−1
. Nevertheless, the improvements in energy density and power capability simply through 
nanostructuring of electrode materials are still limited.[16]
Therefore, transformative advances are still in urgent need to 
realize bulk phase-like high energy density at surface-like fast 
kinetics for electrode materials.
Fe2O3 draws considerable attention in SCs due to many advantages including variable oxidation states, rich abundance, low 
cost, and environmental friendliness.[17] One significant drawback of Fe2O3 that restricts its supercapacitive performance is its 
poor electrical conductivity (electronic and ionic). Various strategies like using doped Fe2O3 and reducing the particle size have 
been adopted to decrease the ion diffusion length and improve 
the electron transport in the electrode.[18,19] Despite the enhanced 
rate or power density in recent years, pseudocapacitive charge 
storage capacities acquired from the Fe2O3-based electrodes are 
still low and far from satisfactory.[20] The limited capacitance of 
Fe2O3 mainly originates from a combination of cation (Li+, Na+, 
etc.) adsorption/desorption on the surface, forming the double 
layer capacitance and the cation-involved redox reaction near the 
surface region, giving pseudocapacitance. In recent years, using 
redox electrolyte has been proposed as a new approach to induce 
extra redox reactions at the electrode surface to further increase 
the charge storage capacity.[21,22] These works demonstrated that 
the kinetics of the redox electrolyte-involved reactions is as fast as 
the ion electrosorption process. When the redox electrolyte was adopted with the nanostructured electrode, the energy density 
of the electrode can be further increased without sacrificing the 
excellent power capability due to the extra redox reactions only 
occurring at the electrode surface. It was reported that Na2SO3
solution can function as the redox electrolyte for iron oxide by 
providing reversible sulfite ion-involved redox reactions at the 
electrode/electrolyte interface.[23] However, sulfite ions are negatively charged and tend to depart from the electrode surface when 
a negative potential is applied to the electrode, thus resulting in 
very limited pseudocapacitance contribution (less than 100 C g−1
) 
to the iron-oxide-based electrodes in previous works. To the best 
of our knowledge, the “bridges” between the iron oxides and the 
redox electrolyte remain uncharted and need to be established to 
confine the sulfite ions and augment the sulfite-induced pseudocapacitance. In addition, the aqueous redox electrolyte like 
Na2SO3 can only remain stable in a narrow potential window 
(<1.2 V). A high voltage supercapacitor device based on the iron 
oxide/Na2SO3 system has never been realized.
Herein, for the first time, by modifying the surface of Fe2O3, 
we developed oxygen-deficient Fe2O3 quantum dots anchored 
on graphene nanosheets (denoted as V-FG) that enable highly 
efficient dual-ion redox reactions involving both the cation and 
the anion at the surface in the Na2SO3 electrolyte. The manipulation of redox ions (SO3
2−) onto the Fe2O3 surface was first 
demonstrated via greatly enhanced surface chemical adsorption tuned by surface oxygen vacancies (denoted as Vo) in 
Fe2O3. With enhanced chemical adsorption, we can tether the 
redox electrolyte ions (SO3
2−) to the electrode surface to facilitate the anion-involved redox reactions at the electrode surface, 
contributing extra pseudocapacitance to the electrode. Moreover, owing to the electronegative surface of V-FG with adsorbed 
SO3
2−, accordingly more Na+ ions can be attracted to the electrode surface, facilitating the formation of double-layer capacitance and cation-involved redox reaction with Na+ intercalation. 
The synergistic combination of both the cation (Na+)- and the 
anion (SO3
2−)-involved redox reactions on the Fe2O3 surface 
enables rapid charge transport, i.e., high rate capability, as well 
as high pseudocapacitance. Significantly, the V-FG electrode 
achieves a high specific capacity up to 749 C g−1
 in 1 m Na2SO3
electrolyte and retains 290 C g−1
 at an ultrahigh scan rate of 
3.2 V s−1
. Importantly, to break the potential window limit of 
the Na2SO3 electrolyte, a high voltage asymmetric supercapacitor was constructed with dual-electrolyte design. For the first 
time, a 2 V Fe2O3/Na2SO3//MnO2/Na2SO4 asymmetric supercapacitor was successfully constructed, delivering a high energy 
density of 75 W h kg−1
 at 3125 W kg−1.
To ensure effective large surface area and fast charge transport, a nanocomposite with Fe2O3 quantum dots anchored on 
graphene nanosheets (denoted as FG) was prepared (for details, 
see the Experimental Section) and adopted in this work.[24] As 
illustrated in Figure 1a, a facile surface modification strategy 
was developed to introduce Vo in Fe2O3 and prepare V-FG for 
tunable adsorption of redox-active SO3
2− in the Na2SO3 electrolyte. Typically, the V-FG was prepared via simply immersing FG 
in 1 m NaBH4 solution for 0.5–2 h (for details, see the Experimental Section). Figure S1 (Supporting Information) shows 
the Raman spectra collected for FG and V-FG. All of the peaks 
in the Raman spectra (Figure S1a, Supporting Information) can be well indexed to the characteristic peaks of α-Fe2O3.
[25]
Compared to FG, no obvious change is observed in the spectrum of V-FG, indicating that no phase transformation occurs 
during the modification process. In addition, the treatment of 
samples in the NaBH4 solution did not bring obvious change to 
graphene, with ID/IG ratio slightly increased from 1.27 to 1.33 
(Figure S1b, Supporting Information). Figure 1b shows the Fe 
2p core-level X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra 
and the corresponding difference spectrum for V-FG and FG 
samples. The Fe 2p3/2 peaks of both the samples located at 
711.4 eV can be ascribed typically to Fe3+ in Fe2O3.
[26] The value 
is incompatible within FeO. Moreover, the small satellite peaks 
of both the samples centered at 719 eV are most likely raised 
from the presence of Fe3+ species.[27] Notably, in contrast to FG, 
the V-FG gives rise to a higher intensity of satellite peak located 
at 716 eV, which is indicative of the presence of Fe2+, i.e., Vo
in hematite. As shown in Figure 1c, the transmission electron microscope (TEM) image of V-FG demonstrates the welldefined graphene nanosheets with rough surface decorated with 
numerous quantum dots. Figure S2 (Supporting Information) 
shows the high angle annular dark field–scanning transmission electron microscopy image of V-FG. The Fe2O3 quantum 
dots with size of 3–4 nm are homogeneously distributed and 
anchored on the graphene nanosheet, which is beneficial for 
hindering the aggregation of quantum dots. Furthermore, the 
corresponding high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image is displayed in Figure 1d, presenting the 
well crystallized hematite quantum dots (denoted as V-F Qd) 
with an average diameter of 3–4 nm. The well-defined lattice 
fringes with interplanar spacings of 0.164 and 0.229 nm are in 
good accordance with the (211) and (006) planes of hematite 
(JCPDS#33-0664), respectively. In addition, the electron energy 
loss spectroscopy spectra of Fe L2,3 edges at three selected sites 
on the V-FG sample (marked in Figure S2 in the Supporting 
Information) are shown in the inset of Figure 1e. The peak 
intensity ratio of Fe L3 to Fe L2 is dependent upon the oxidation state of the metal. The average Fe L3/L2 ratio of V-FG is 
calculated to be 4.98 based on the three Fe L2 and L3 lines (inset 
of Figure 1e). For further determinations, the reported L3/L2
ratio values of different iron oxides including α-Fe2O3, Fe3O4, 
and FeO were used as calibration standards (Figure 1e).[28] By 
comparing the calibration standards with the average Fe L3/L2
ratio of V-FG (4.98), the average oxidation state of Fe in V-FG is 
estimated to be less than 3, again convincing the presence of 
Vo in V-FG.
The electrochemical behavior of the V-FG electrode was 
investigated using a three-electrode cell with 1 m Na2SO3 electrolyte in a negative potential window of 0–1 V versus saturated 
calomel electrode (SCE). To understand the influence of surface modification and redox electrolyte on the electrochemical 
behavior of the V-FG electrode, the electrochemical behaviors of 
the FG electrode in 1 m Na2SO3 electrolyte and the V-FG electrode in 1 m Na2SO4 electrolyte were also investigated as control groups. For simplification, the V-FG and FG electrodes in 
1 m Na2SO3 or 1 m Na2SO4 electrolyte were denoted as V-FG/
Na2SO3, FG/Na2SO3, and V-FG/Na2SO4, respectively. The corresponding cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of the three systems were collected at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 (Figure S3, 
Supporting Information) and compared in Figure 2a, where 
in all the cases, reversible redox peaks are observed. With the same V-FG electrode, substantially higher current densities 
and more obvious redox peaks are observed in the CV curve 
using 1 m Na2SO3 electrolyte than using 1 m Na2SO4 electrolyte. 
The significantly enhanced redox behaviors can be assigned to 
SO3
2−-involved redox reactions occurring in the potential range 
of –1 to 0 V (vs SCE) for the V-FG electrode, as shown in the 
following Equations (1) and (2)[23,29]

As compared to Na2SO3, Na2SO4 is not a redox active electrolyte because SO4
2− is quite stable in the same potential range 
and not involved in the redox reactions. Therefore, for the 
Na2SO4 electrolyte, only Na+ ions are involved in the redox reactions, thus leading to greatly reduced pseudocapacitance.
Turning to the CV behaviors for V-FG/Na2SO3 and FG/
Na2SO3 systems, in sharp contrast, the V-FG/Na2SO3 system 
achieved remarkably larger current densities as compared to 
that of the FG/Na2SO3 system. Notably, a pair of redox peaks, 
marked as (I) in Figure 2a for the V-FG/Na2SO3 system can be 
attributed to the redox reaction described in the Equation (1).[29]
As shown in Figure S4 (Supporting Information), the CV curve 
of the FG/Na2SO3 system collected at 10 mV s−1 only exhibits 
a small peak located at ≈−0.18 V (vs SCE). In contrast, the CV 
curve of the V-FG/Na2SO3 system at 10 mV s−1 shows a much 
more pronounced peak with much larger current density at 
the same potential (Figure S5, Supporting Information), indicating substantially enhanced redox reactions corresponding to 
SO3
2−/S2O3
2− redox couples after Vo introduction. Figure 2b and 
Figure S5 (Supporting Information) show the CV curves of the 
V-FG electrode in the Na2SO3 electrolyte collected from 5 mV s−1
to 3.2 V s−1
. Significantly, the CV curves of the V-FG/Na2SO3
system can retain pronounced redox peaks even at a super 
high scan rate of 3.2 V s−1
, implying the fast response pseudocapacitive behavior in the V-FG/Na2SO3 system. Note that the 
CV curves of the pure graphene treated with NaBH4 has much 
smaller current density and capacitance contribution at all the 
scan rates (Figure S6, Supporting Information) as compared to 
those of the V-FG electrode. Therefore, the possibility that the 
large capacitance contribution for the V-FG electrode at high 
scan rates originating predominantly from graphene can be 
ruled out.
The specific capacities of the V-FG/Na2SO3, FG/Na2SO3, and 
V-FG/Na2SO4 systems as a function of scan rate are compared 
in Figure 2c. As expected, the V-FG/Na2SO3 system shows much 
higher specific capacities at all the scan rates from 5 mV s−1
 to 
3.2 V s−1
 when compared to the FG/Na2SO3 and V-FG/Na2SO4
systems. Specifically, the specific capacity of the V-FG electrode 
in the Na2SO3 electrolyte is 749 C g−1
 at 5 mV s−1
, which is much 
larger than 410 C g−1
 for the V-FG/Na2SO4 and 330 C g−1
 for 
the FG/Na2SO3 at the same scan rate. This value for the V-FG 
electrode is also much higher than those of previously reported 
Fe2O3-based electrodes, such as Ni nanotube arrays@Fe2O3
nanoneedles (334 C g−1
 at 10 mV s−1
),[30] Fe2O3 nanorods 
(≈620 C g−1
 at ≈3.5 mV s−1
),[31] hollow and porous Fe2O3 (measured in 0.5 m Na2SO3, 245 C g−1
 at 5 mV s−1
),[32] and so on. 
Remarkably, the V-FG/Na2SO3 system manifested superior rate 
performance with as high as 290 C g−1
 retained at super high scan 
rate of 3.2 V s−1
. In comparison, the capacity of the V-FG/Na2SO4
system decreased to 120 C g−1
 at 3.2 V s−1
 and that of the FG/
Na2SO3 system reduced to 109 C F g−1
 at 0.8 V s−1
. The roughly 
doubled specific capacity and enhanced rate performance of the 
V-FG/Na2SO3 system indicate the significant role of Vo at the 
Fe2O3 surface in manipulating the anion-involved surface redox 
reactions, which enables the ultrafast responsed pseudocapacitance. As far as we know, the superior rate performance (38.7% 
from 5 to 3200 mV s−1
) of the V-FG electrode in the Na2SO3 electrolyte is the highest record as compared to the ever reported highrate Fe2O3-based electrodes, such as Ni nanotube arrays@Fe2O3
nanoneedles (≈24% from 10 to 2000 mV s−1
),[30] T-Fe2O3@Ppy 
(≈12% from 10 to 750 mV s−1
),[33] and NiCo2S4@Fe2O3 (≈18% 
from ≈6.7 to 1200 mV s−1
).[34] Additionally, the long-term cycling 
stability of the V-FG/Na2SO3 system was evaluated at a slow scan 
rate of 25 mV s−1
 for 2000 cycles (Figure 2d). After 2000 cycles, 
about 92% of initial capacity can be retained, indicating the outstanding cycling performance.
To better understand the boosted electrochemical performance of the V-FG/Na2SO3 system, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were conducted for 
the V-FG/Na2SO3, FG/Na2SO3, and V-FG/Na2SO4 systems. 
The Nyquist plots of the three systems are demonstrated in 
Figure 2e. For each EIS spectrum, two distinct parts including 
a semicircle (in the high-frequency region) and a straight slope 
(in the low-frequency region) are considered to be related to 
the charge transfer process and the diffusion-limited process, 
respectively. After fitting the EIS spectra using the equivalent 
circuit (Figure S7, Supporting Information), both the equivalent 
series resistance (Rs: 0.32 Ω) and the charge transfer resistance 
(Rct: 1.1 Ω) of the V-FG /Na2SO3 system are the smallest values 
as compared to those of the V-FG/Na2SO4 (Rs: 0.67 Ω; Rct: 2.55 Ω) 
and FG/Na2SO3 (Rs: 0.76 Ω; Rct: 2.75 Ω) systems. Furthermore, 
in the Bode plots (inset of Figure 2e), characteristic frequency 
(f0) at the phase angle of −45° of the V-FG/Na2SO3, FG/Na2SO3, 
and V-FG/Na2SO4 systems are determined to be 200, 10, and 
7.5 Hz, corresponding to the time constant τ (1/f0) of 0.005, 0.1, 
and 0.13 s, respectively. The substantially smaller time constant 
τ of the V-FG/Na2SO3 system indicates the ultrafast frequency 
response, again confirming the highly efficient charge (electron 
and ion) transport of the V-FG electrode during the charge/discharge process in the Na2SO3 electrolyte. It is speculated that 
the Vo in Fe2O3 can greatly improve the electrical conductivity 
of the electrode and boost the kinetics of the anion-involved 
redox reactions at the electrode surface.
To further understand the storage mechanism of the V-FG/
Na2SO3 system, the surface capacity contribution and the diffusion-controlled capacity contribution of the total stored charge 
were separated from the CV data by using Dunn’s method (Supporting Information).[35,36] The total stored charge is composed 
of three components: (I) non-Faradaic contribution from the 
double-layer capacitance (Na+ adsorption/desorption); (II) Faradaic contribution from the chemisorbed redox groups at the 
surface; (III) another Faradaic contribution from the diffusioncontrolled redox reaction associated with Na+ insertion at the 
near surface region. In the Na2SO3 electrolyte, the insertion/
deinsertion of Na+ into/from the V-FG electrode was confirmed by Na 1s core-level XPS spectra (Figure S8, Supporting Information), which present obvious Na 1s signal at −1.0 V versus 
SCE (discharge state) in comparison with no signal for the pristine sample and much reduced signal at 0 V versus SCE (charge 
state). Figure S9 (Supporting Information) presents the CV 
curves for the three systems at a scan rate of 25 mV s−1
, respectively, with the shadowed regions representing the capacitive 
contributions for each system. For the V-FG/Na2SO3 system, 
the capacitive contribution, holding 70% of the total capacity, 
is much higher than 51% for the V-FG/Na2SO4 and 56% for 
the FG/Na2SO3. Furthermore, Figure 3a,b summarize the fast 
response surface capacity (pseudocapacitance and double layer 
capacitance) and the diffusion controlled capacity at different 
scan rates from 5 to 100 mV s−1
. For the V-FG/Na2SO3 system, 
when the scan rate increases from 5 to 100 mV s−1, the surface 
controlled capacity changes slightly from 361 to 344 C g−1
, 
whereas the diffusion controlled capacity decreases sharply 
from 380 to 30 C g−1
, indicating that the capacity of the V-FG 
electrode is mainly contributed by surface controlled capacity at 
high scan rates beyond 100 mV s−1
. Similar trends can also be 
observed for both the V-FG/Na2SO4 and FG/Na2SO3 systems. 
Without the redox electrolyte, the surface controlled capacities 
of the V-FG/Na2SO4 system are in the range of 168–172 C g−1
between 5 and 100 mV s−1
, which indicates that the capacity contributed by the adsorbed SO3
2−-involved redox reaction for the 
V-FG/Na2SO3 system should be in the range of 177–192 C g−1
. 
Significantly, the adsorbed SO3
2−-raised capacity is crucial in 
retaining high specific capacitance for the V-FG electrode at 
an ultrahigh scan rate of 3.2 V s−1
, which enables high energy 
density in less than 1 s It is speculated that the improved pseudocapacitance of the 
V-FG electrode in the redox electrolyte of Na2SO3 is correlated 
with the surface modification via Vo introduction in Fe2O3. For 
better quantification of effects of Vo on adsorbing SO3
2−, quartzcrystal microbalance (QCM) was used to analyze the mass variations of the V-FG/FG electrodes after the immersion into different electrolytes. The frequency variations (∆f) of the FG and 
V-FG electrodes as a function of time when being immersed in 
distilled water, 1 m Na2SO4, and 1 m Na2SO3 electrolytes are shown 
in Figure 3c,d. The ∆f is related to the adsorbed mass of specific 
adsorption according to the calculation (Supporting information). As compared to the FG electrode, the V-FG electrode exhibited much higher ∆f value in 1 m Na2SO3 but almost unchanged 
∆f values in distilled water and 1 m Na2SO4, which means that 
the V-FG electrode became “heavier” than the FG electrode in the 
Na2SO3 electrolyte. The mass gains are believed to be attributed 
to the specific adsorption of ions. Figure 3e and Table S1 (Supporting Information) summarized the mass gains of the V-FG 
electrodes with different Vo contents in various electrolytes based 
on frequency variations in Figure S10 (Supporting Information). 
For simplification, the FG treated in 1 m NaBH4 for 0.5 h is 
denoted as V-1M-0.5h and so on. Notably, these samples retained 
the hematite phase (Figure S11, Supporting Information) with 
longer treatment time up to 1.5 h in 1 m NaBH4, indicating no 
phase change during the NaBH4 treatment.[25] Remarkably, the 
QCM results indicate that the V-FG samples adsorbed larger 
amounts of SO3
2− anions than the FG samples, demonstrating 
that the enhanced anion adsorptions are resulted from the Vo
introduction in Fe2O3. Specifically, the V-1M-1h sample delivered 
the largest adsorption mass of 1336 ng, which doubles the value 
of untreated FG sample in Na2SO3 and is also higher than the 
V-1M-0.5h and V-1M-1.5h samples. As expected, the amount of 
oxygen vacancies of hematite, which is highly dependent on the 
immersion time in NaBH4 solution, is crucial to tune the adsorption of SO3
2−. However, the V-1M-1.5h sample with immersion time of 1.5 h displays obvious agglomeration of hematite 
quantum dots (Figure S12, Supporting Information), which can 
be attributed to their high surface energy induced by increased 
oxygen vacancies.[37,38] Accordingly, the aggregation of nanoparticles can greatly reduce their effective surface area, thus leading 
to relatively decreased adsorption of SO3
2− for V-FG-1M-1.5h 
as compared to V-FG-1M-1h.
For the pristine FG electrode, the redox electrolyte cannot be 
effectively utilized for the unmodified Fe2O3 surface without 
a strong chemical adsorption of the sulfite ions. As shown in 
Figure 3f, when the FG electrode is negatively charged, the electrolyte cations (Na+) are drawn toward the negatively charged 
surface, while the electrolyte anions (SO3
2−) tend to be pushed 
away without strong adsorption to the surface. Therefore, the 
anion-involved redox reaction at the surface is greatly limited, 
which cannot lead to a significant increase for the pseudocapacitance for the electrode. In the case of the V-FG electrode 
(Figure 3g), large amounts of sulfite ions are absorbed at the 
Fe2O3 surface even when the electrode is negatively charged 
due to the enhanced anion adsorption, thus resulting in greatly 
increased pseudocapacitance. In the meantime, the cationinvolved redox reaction proceeds near the surface region of 
the V-FG electrode with Na+ intercalation under negative electrode potential. By establishing “bridges” between the electrode 
surface and the dual ions (anions and cations), we can easily 
generate tunable amounts of pseudocapacitance, especially at 
ultrahigh scan rates at 3.2 V s−1
. For the V-FG/Na2SO3 system, 
the capacity difference as compared to the V-FG/Na2SO4 system 
(Figure 2c) at high scan rates can be attributed to the adsorbed 
SO3
2−-involved pseudocapacitance, which is around 170 C g−1
 at 
3.2 V s−1
. Therefore, the pseudocapacitance from SO3
2− for the 
V-FG electrode contributes the major (around 59%) capacity at 
such a high scan rate.
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out 
to investigate the role of Vo in establishing the “bridge” between 
the hematite surface and the electrolyte (Na2SO3). The DFT calculations were performed within software of Vienna Ab Initio 
Simulation Package (details can be seen in the Supporting 
Information). Different potential configurations of Na2SO3 to 
be close to the Fe2O3 (001) surface have been considered and 
the most stable configurations were selected according to the 
values of adsorption energy. Figure 4a,b show the local minima 
of the Fe2O3 (001)/Na2SO3 configuration optimized via DFT 
considering the perfect Fe2O3 (001) surface and the nonstoichiometric Fe2O3 (001) surface with Vo (denoted as Fe2O3 (001):Vo), 
respectively. As shown in the optimized configurations, the 
SO3
2− is preferentially adsorbed onto the Fe2O3 (001) surface 
via interaction between the S atom of sulfite and the O atom 
of Fe2O3. Simultaneously, one O atom of sulfite interacts with 
Fe atom to further stabilize the structure. The bond lengths of 
S(sulfite)O(Fe2O3) (1.541 Å) and O(sulfite)Fe(Fe2O3) (2.011 Å) 
in Fe2O3 (001):Vo/Na2SO3 are shorter than those of Fe2O3 (001)/
Na2SO3 (1.596 Å, 2.040 Å), indicating the stronger interaction 
between Na2SO3 and Fe2O3 (001) after Vo introduction. On both 
the perfect and the nonstoichiometric Fe2O3 (001) surface, the 
adsorption of Na2SO3 is exothermic by −4.19 eV (−40.4 kJ mol−1
) 
and −4.63 eV (−44.6 kJ mol−1
), respectively, which are indicative of the spontaneous chem-adsorption. Moreover, the more 
negative adsorption energy of Fe2O3 (001):Vo/Na2SO3 suggests 
that the adsorption of Na2SO3 favors the Fe2O3 (001):Vo surface 
more than the Fe2O3 (001) surface. This is also evidenced by 
the charge-density difference. Two slices are taken along the 
axis of the FeOSO bonds (Figure 4c,d) and at the surface (Figure 4e,f) of the optimized adsorbed surface structure, 
respectively. For the S(sulfite)O(Fe2O3), a clear charge redistribution can be observed. Along the bond direction, the charge 
distributed around both the S (sulfite) atom and the O (Fe2O3) 
atom moved toward the O(Fe2O3) atom side after the introduction of Vo, indicating an enhanced binding energy between 
the adsorbates and the Fe2O3 surface. Moreover, for the slices 
taken at the surface, charge accumulation can be clearly visualized in the O atoms located around Vo, which can be attributed 
to the charge from Vo being transferred to the surrounding O 
atoms, thus leading to the enhanced binding energy between 
the adsorbates and the Fe2O3 surface. More interestingly, the 
charge accumulated surface also caused strong adsorption 
of Na+.
Although the V-FG/Na2SO3 system can provide attractive 
pseudocapacitive performance, it should be noted that the 
Na2SO3 electrolyte is only stable in negative potential window 
due to the irreversible oxidation of the Na2SO3 electrolyte in 
the positive potential window.[23] Therefore, a high voltage 
supercapacitor device beyond 1.2 V based on the Na2SO3 electrolyte and the Fe2O3 electrode has never been reported 
before in previous works. In the present work, for the first 
time, a dual-electrolyte asymmetric supercapacitor device based 
on V-FG/Na2SO3 and MnO2/Na2SO4 systems (for details, see 
the Experimental Section) (denoted as V-FG/Na2SO3//MnO2/
Na2SO4 ASC) with a selective sodium ion exchange membrane 
sandwiched in between the two electrolytes (as illustrated in 
Figure 5a) has been successfully constructed, achieving a high 
operating voltage of 2 V. By adopting this hybrid full cell configuration, the V-FG/Na2SO3 system can be well stabilized, full releasing its outstanding anode performance. Figure 5b shows 
the CV curves of the V-FG/Na2SO3//MnO2/Na2SO4 ASC device 
operated in different voltage windows, implying that a suitable 
operating voltage window can be extended to 2 V. Moreover, a 
good cycling stability was demonstrated with a ≈92.5% capacitance retention over 2000 cycles at a current density of 6.24 A g−1
(Figure S13, Supporting Information), again confirming the 
suitable voltage window of 0–2 V. In contrast, by using two 
pieces of the V-FG electrodes, a V-FG//V-FG symmetric supercapacitor (denoted as V-FG SSC) was also constructed by 
adopting only the Na2SO3 electrolyte. Although the V-FG SSC 
device exhibited outstanding rate performance and good cycle 
performance (Figures S14 and S15, Supporting Information), 
the operating voltage window was limited to 1 V, which greatly 
undermines the energy density of the device.
As plotted in Figure 5c, the energy density and average power 
density of the V-FG/Na2SO3//MnO2/Na2SO4 ASC device are calculated based on the galvanostatic charge/discharge curves at 
different current densities in Figure S16 (Supporting Information). For comparison, data about the V-FG SSC device of this 
work and previously reported SSC and ASC devices in the literature were also added in Figure 5c. Significantly, the as-assembled 
dual-electrolyte ASC device delivers the highest energy density of 
75 W h kg−1
 at an average power density of 3125 W kg−1
 and 
still retains a high energy density of 34.2 W h kg−1
 at an ultrahigh power density of 25 000 W kg−1
. The values are substantially higher than those of previously reported SSC devices[11,39–42]
and ASC devices such as densely stacked graphene (DSG)//GMnO2 ASC,[43] Fe2O3/functionalized graphene sheet (FGS)//
MnO2/FGS ASC,[24] Na0.21MnO2//reduced graphene oxide (rGO) 
ASC,[44] Nb2O5@C/rGO//activated carbon (AC) ASC,[45] and 
MnO2//Fe2O3@Ppy ASC.[46] Furthermore, for potential application demonstration, two V-FG/Na2SO3//MnO2/Na2SO4 ASC 
devices were connected in series to expand the voltage window to 
4 V, which can be used to charge a cell phone (MI 1s phone) as 
illustrated in inset of Figure 5c.
In summary, a highly efficient Fe2O3-based electrode material has been developed with effective dual-ion (cation and 
anion)-involved redox reactions via using a redox active electrolyte of Na2SO3. The confinement of redox active ions in the electrolyte to the electrode surface is found to be the key to enable 
the effective anion-involved redox reactions that leads to further 
increase in pseudocapacitance. With the surface Vo introduction to Fe2O3, the sulfite ions are attached to the Fe2O3 surface 
by enhanced chemical adsorption. In contrast to the ordinary 
electrode in energy storage process, the specific capacity of the 
as-designed V-FG electrode with absorbed redox-active ions has 
been maximally decoupled from the limitations of ion diffusion. 
Consequently, large insertion-like specific capacity (750 C g−1
) 
has been obtained for the hematite-based electrode with 
extremely fast electrode kinetics. The V-FG electrode can still 
deliver a large specific capacity of 290 C g−1 at an ultrahigh 
scan rate of 3.2 V s−1, which is mainly contributed by the 
SO3
2−-involved surface redox reactions. For the first time, an 
extraordinary 2 V dual-electrolyte asymmetric supercapacitor 
device with both high energy density and power density has been 
successfully fabricated, using the Na2SO3 electrolyte for the 
V-FG anode and the Na2SO4 electrolyte for the MnO2 cathode. 
The potential of novel approach in this work for achieving 
insertion-like capacity at ultrahigh rate is exciting and opens up 
new opportunities for next generation supercapacitors"
12_int.txt,"Supercapacitors (SCs) have gained tremendous research interest owing to their high 
power density, fast charge/discharge rate, high reliability, and long cycling life.

Specially, the flexible SCs demonstrate significant predominance such as light weight, 
excellent reliability, mechanical flexibility, environment friendliness and safety, which 
can be served as high-efficient power sources to fulfill the requirements of 
next-generation wearable and portable electronics.4-6 Nonetheless, the energy density 
of current available SCs is still very low. In order to increase the energy density of the 
SC system, the assembly of flexible asymmetric SCs (ASCs) has been exploited to 
extend the operating voltage window of the SC system. The development of flexible 
ASC devices requires the rational design of electrode construction and preparation of 
highly active electrode materials. The strategy for loading highly active electrode 
materials on monolithic 3D porous graphene-based substrates, e.g., graphene foam 
(GF), graphene aerogel (GA), graphene hydrogel (GH) will be effective in developing 
advanced flexible ASC devices.7-9 These graphene-based macroscopic materials 
assembled from continuously interconnected individual graphene nanosheets possess 
macroporous structure, low mass density, exceptional mechanical properties, high 
stability and conductivity, large surface area and abundant surface functional groups.

The active electrode materials grown on these 3D graphene substrates can be directly 
utilized as integrated electrodes, which avoid the utilization of any polymer binder 
and conductive additives, and therefore meet the requirements of flexible and 
light-weight supercapacitor architecture.10-14
Recently, great progresses have been achieved in the development of active 
electrode materials based on a range of transition metal oxides owing to their large 
specific capacitance and high energy density originated from their multiple oxidation 
states for pseudocapacitance. For instance, cobalt oxide (Co3O4) has exhibited an 
extremely high theoretical specific capacitance of 3600 F g-1 and excellent capability 
retention.15 And manganese dioxide (MnO2) also offers several advantages such as 
high specific capacitance of 1370 F g-1, earth-abundance, cheapness, and 
eco-friendliness.16-18 These properties make them promising candidate as positive 
electrode materials for ASC devices. Furthermore, as an alternative negative electrode 
material, iron oxide (e.g., Fe2O3) has been extensively investigated due to their 
excellent capacitive performances in negative potential.19-22 In recent time, binary 
metal oxides, e.g., NiCo2O4, ZnCo2O4, MnMoO4, NiMoO4 and CoMoO4, have 
demonstrated superior electrochemical properties to single-component oxides due to 
their feasible oxidation states and good electrical conductivity.23-27 Among them, 
binary CoMoO4, which combines the salient features of extremely high theoretical 
specific capacitance of cobalt oxide and rich polymorphism and reversible small ions 
storage of molybdenum oxide, has exhibited improved overall performances including 
high capacitance, high energy density, and excellent durability.28,29
Despite the achievements in developing different single or binary transition 
metal oxides as highly active electrode materials for ASC system, these 
ACS Paragon Plus Environment

semiconductive metal oxides exhibit low power density attributed to their low 
electrical conductivity and insufficient electron transfer at high rates. As a result, 
tremendous research efforts have been devoted to solve these problems. For instant, 
developing nanostructured metal oxide, e.g., nanoparticles, nanowires, porous 
nanoflakes and hollowed nanospheres, can increase the contact area of 
electrode/electrolyte and favor the active species diffusion and electron transport 
process, thus enable fast redox reaction at high rates.30-33 Meanwhile, modifying metal 
oxides by doping metal ions into their crystal structure and/or integrating metal oxide 
with high-electrically-conductive nanomaterials have been demonstrated to be 
operative strategies to increase the specific capacitance and improve the conductivity 
and cycling ability.34-36 Significantly, it has been demonstrated that hydrogenating 
metal oxides by controlled introduction of oxygen vacancy states can improve their 
electrical conductivity and facilitate the surface redox reactions kinetics,37-40 which is 
anticipated to be a facile, effective and reliable strategy to improve the capacitive 
properties of resultant electrode materials. 
In this work, we develop well-ordered hydrogenated metal oxide i.e.,
hydrogenated CoMoO4 (H-CoMoO4) and hydrogenated Fe2O3 (H-Fe2O3) nanoplate 
arrays standing up on 3D GF, and explore their practice application as positive 
electrode and negative electrodes, respectively, for assembling flexible all-solid-state 
ASC device. Fig. 1 schematically illustrates the preparation procedure of the proposed 
flexible ACS based on 3D GF supported H-CoMoO4 (GF/H-CoMoO4) and GF 
supported H-Fe2O3 (GF/H-Fe2O3). The monolithic 3D porous GF was prepared by 
solution casting method using Ni foam as the template. The as-obtained GF material 
possesses superior electrical conductivity, large surface area and sufficient surface

functional groups, which not only facilitate the in situ growth of CoMoO4 and Fe2O3
nanoplates on GF scaffold, but also contribute to the double-layer capacitance of 
resultant ASC system. H-CoMoO4 and H-Fe2O3 nanoplate arrays were directly grown 
on 3D GF substrate by a facile hydrothermal synthesis, followed by hydrogenation 
treatment. The well-ordered metal oxide nanoplate arrays with high surface to volume 
ratio can facilitate the surface reactions and species transport from electrode surface to 
subsurface. Furthermore, the direct growth of H-CoMoO4 and H-Fe2O3 nanoplate 
arrays on GF enables the structure integration and good electrical contact of active 
materials and electrode substrate toward binder-free flexible electrodes, which 
reduces Ohmic polarization as well as improves the rate capability and cycling 
stability. Therefore, the as-prepared GF/H-CoMoO4 and GF/H-Fe2O3 electrodes 
exhibit fast charge transport pathway, low contact resistance and unique mechanical 
properties. More importantly, our findings reveal that the introduction of oxygen 
vacancies in H-CoMoO4 and H-Fe2O3 nanoplates via thermal decomposition of 
precursor under H2/Ar atmosphere can increase their electronic conductivity as well 
as improve their donor density as well as the surface properties, and give rise to a 
substantially improved electrochemical performance, which is much better than those 
obtained in pure Ar atmosphere. Under the optimized condition, the resultant 
GF/H-CoMoO4 electrode and GF/H-Fe2O3 electrode exhibit high areal capacitance up 
to 5360 mF cm-2 and 694 mF cm-2, respectively, with excellent rate capability. The
ASC device based on GF/H-CoMoO4 (positive electrode) and GF/H-Fe2O3 (negative 
electrode) achieves a high energy density of 1.13 mWh cm-3 at a current density of 5 
mA cm-3, a high power density of 150 kW cm-3 at a current density of 200 mA cm-3, 
and good cycling stability. After 5000 times charge-discharge cycling, the flexible

13_int.txt,"Electrochemical energy storage devices, mainly including 
battery and supercapacitor, have attracted enormous
attention because of widespread applications in portable 
electronics, electrified transportation and so on. 
Supercapacitors with high cyclability offer more power 
densities than batteries and are used in many fields. However, 
one limitation of electrochemical supercapacitors is the low 
energy density and for this reason, pseudocapacitive materials 
with faradaic charge storage have attracted increasing 
interest.1
 Among them, Co3O4
, as one of the most promising 
active materials for electrochemical supercapacitors, has 
received considerable attention due to its high theoretical 
specific capacitance (3560 F g‒1), excellent reversible redox 
behavior, environmental friendliness, abundance, low costs 
and good corrosion stability.2
 Nevertheless, the most of 
reported capacitances of Co3O4
-based supercapacitors are far 
less than the theoretical value. Generally, the relatively poor 
intrinsic electronic conductivity and the low utilization 
efficiency of electroactive Co3O4
 greatly limit its observed 
specific capacitance. It is well known that the Faradaic redox 
reaction process for pseudocapacitor involves the 
insertion/extraction of protons or ions within the first few 
nanometers beneath the surface of electrode materials.3
Therefore, supercapacitors based on 2D Co3O4
 nanosheets 
could achieve an enhanced electrochemical performance 
resulting from the highly efficient utilization of the 
electroactive materials, short electron/ion diffusion path 
distance.4
 To address the relatively poor intrinsic electronic 
conductivity, Co3O4
-based composites with conductive 
materials such as carbon materials5
, metal,6
 and conducting 
polymers7
 have been intensely investigated recently. However, 
since the intrinsic properties of Co3O4
 have not been changed, 
the improvement of Co3O4
 conductivity by the external 
conductors is very limited because of the restriction of the 
Co3O4/conductor interfaces. Recently, it is reported that the 
electrical conductivity and specific capacity of the metal oxide 
can be efficiently improved by the functionalized surface8
 or 
the introduction of oxygen vacancies as shallow donors.
9 Kim 
et al. compared the reduced α-MoO3 with full oxidized αMoO3
, and demonstrated that the introduction of oxygen 
vacancies into the α-MoO3
 lattice led to larger interlayer 
spacing and more Mo4+ contents, which extended cycling life 
and the specific capacitance.10 Wang et al. reported the

capacitance of 978 F g‒1

11 However, most previous 
investigations are focused on the as-prepared Co3O4
 with 
certain oxygen vacancies, while the resultant improvement in 
electronic conductivity and capacitance along with different 
content of oxygen vacancies, especially the intrinsic 
conductivity, the structure, chemistry, and supercapacitor 
performance of Co3O4 raised by pure oxygen vacancies are far 
less investigated. 
 Herein, we fabricate a set of identical 2D Co3O4
 NSs with 
varied contents of oxygen vacancies to examine the effects of 
oxygen vacancies over the intrinsic conductivity, the structure, 
chemistry, and supercapacitor performance of Co3O4
 NSs. To 
examine the role of pure oxygen vacancies on the electronic 
structure and property of Co3O4
 NSs, the different contents of 
oxygen vacancies are expected to be created in the same 
precursor without the changes of shape/size. In this 
investigation we take the Co3O4
 NSs as an example. The 
diagram of the fabrication of Co3O4
 NSs with varied contents of 
oxygen vacancies is illustrated The whole process involves several steps: firstly, 
the green cobalt hydroxide precursors are synthesized through 
a facile wet chemistry method; and secondly, 2D Co3O4
 NSs 
(denoted as pristine-Co3O4
 NSs) are obtained after calcination 
at 300°C in air. Then, the as-synthesized Co3O4
 NSs are 
reduced in hydrogen/nitrogen at 200°C (denoted as H200-
Co3O4
 NSs) and in 1 M NaBH4
 solution (denoted as OVR-Co3O4
NSs), respectively. 
 Figure 2a and Figure S1b show the SEM and TEM images of 
the as-prepared pristine Co3O4
 NSs, respectively, which reveal 
obvious 2D nanosheets with the thickness of ~20 nm. Figure 
2b-c and Figure S1c-d show the SEM and TEM images of H200-
Co3O4
 NSs and OVR-Co3O4
 NSs, respectively, which reveal 
nanosheet shape almost the same as the pristine-Co3O4
 NSs. 
Figure 2d clearly shows that a typical nanosheet is consisted of 
many ultrafine nanoparticles tightly interconnecting with each 
other in planar direction. This unique nanosheet structure is 
beneficial for electrolyte diffusion and the utilization of 
electroactive materials. The HRTEM and selected area electron 
diffraction (SAED) are performed to further analyze the crystal 
structure of the OVR-Co3O4
 NSs. From the HRTEM image (the 
upper-right inset in Figure 2d), distinct lattice fringes of 0.28 
nm, which correspond to the (220) planes in the Co3O4
, can be 
observed in OVR-Co3O4
 NSs.12 The SAED patterns (the bottomleft inset in Figure 2d) of the OVR-Co3O4
 NSs show five marked 
diffraction rings, assigned to (220), (311), (422), (511), and 
(440) planes of Co3O4
, consistent with the following XRD 
results. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) is employed to investigate the crystal 
structure change caused by the reduction treatment. As shown 
in Figure 2e, the diffraction peaks of all samples could be 
indexed as spinel phase Co3O4
 (JCPDS 42-1467) without any 
other peaks, indicating that the spinel structure of pristineCo3O4
 NSs can be retained after reduction treatment. Figure 2f 
shows the Nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms of the 
three Co3O4
 NSs, which are very similar to each other. The 
Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas of these Co3O4
NSs are very close to each other (93 vs. 92 vs. 95 m2
 g
‒1 for 
pristine-Co3O4
 NSs, H200-Co3O4
 NSs and OVR-Co3O4
 NSs, 
respectively). Obviously, it can be seen that the reduction 
treatment have negligible effect on the surface structure of 
Co3O4
 NSs, which is consistent with the SEM and TEM results. 
The above characterization results demonstrate that the 
pristine-Co3O4
 NSs, H200-Co3O4
 NSs and OVR-Co3O4
 NSs 
possess nanosheet shape with almost the same surface 
structure, size, and crystalline phase after different reduction 
treatments. 
 Raman spectra of the three samples are recorded to 
characterize the oxygen vacancies. In Figure 3a, there are five 
distinct peaks at 194 cm‒1, 480 cm‒1, 521 cm‒1, 615 cm‒1, and 
688 cm‒1, corresponding to the F2g, Eg
, F2g, F2g, and A1g of 
pristine-Co3O4
 NSs, respectively.13 It is noteworthy that in 
comparison with pristine-Co3O4
 NSs, the characteristic Raman 
modes of H200-Co3O4
 NSs and OVR-Co3O4
 NSs become broad, 
and the major peaks shift in the negative direction of 4 cm‒1
and 7 cm‒2, respectively, which reflects the structural changes 
caused by the increased amount of oxygen vacancies in Co3O4
NSs, originating from the reduction treatment.9a, 9b, 14 X-ray 
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is undertaken to investigate 
the oxygen vacancies and the states of elements in the 
samples. Figure 3b reveals the Co 2p core level spectra of 
pristine-Co3O4
 NSs, H200-Co3O4
 NSs, and OVR-Co3O4
. The two 
major peaks positions locate at around 796 eV and 780 eV, corresponding 
to Co 2p1/2 and Co 2p3/2, respectively. The fitting results of the 
Co 2p XPS spectra demonstrate there are two kinds of Co 
species in the Co3O4
 NSs, including Co2+ with binding energies 
at 781.0 eV and 796.3 eV, and Co3+ with binding energies at 
794.8 eV and 779.6 eV.9c, 15 The calculated Co2+/Co3+ ratio in 
the surface of pristine-Co3O4
 NSs is 1.07, while those of H200-
Co3O4
 NSs and OVR-Co3O4
 NSs are 1.45 and 1.70, respectively. 
All the O 1s XPS spectra (Figure 3c) are broad and 
asymmetrical, indicating the existence of multiple oxygen 
environments.16 The O 1s spectra are deconvoluted into four 
major contributions with the corresponding peaks centered at 
532.4 eV, 531.1 eV, 530 eV and 529.6 eV, corresponding to 
chemisorbed water (OW), oxygen atoms in the vicinity of an 
oxygen vacancy (OV), hydroxyl (OOH) and lattice oxygen (OL
), 
respectively.17 The table in Figure 3d shows the calculated 
Co2+/Co3+ ratios and OV peak area percentages of the Co3O4
NSs, according to the peak area percentage of different 
elemental components obtained from the deconvoluted
spectra. As for OVR-Co3O4
 NSs treated in NaBH4
, the OV peak 
area percentage of 45% is evidently larger than 34% of H200-
Co3O4
 NSs and 26% of pristine-Co3O4
 NSs, which indicates that 
OVR-Co3O4
 NSs gain much more oxygen vacancies during the 
reduction treatment, in good agreement with the 
corresponding Co2+/Co3+ ratios of the Co3O4
 NSs. 
Figure 4a shows the typical cyclic voltammogram (CV) 
curves of pristine-Co3O4
 NSs, H200-Co3O4
 NSs, and OVR-Co3O4
electrode at a scan rate of 5 mV s‒1. The redox peaks appear in 
each voltammogram within the potential windows ranging 
from 0 to 0.55 V, which are distinguishable from those of 
double-layer capacitor. The pesudocapacitive characteristics 
derived from Faradaic reaction near material surface are 
demonstrated by the CV curves. Figure 4a clearly shows that 
the current density and the enclosed CV curves area of OVRCo3O4
 NSs electrodes are much larger than those of the 
pristine-Co3O4
 NSs and H200-Co3O4
 NSs electrodes, indicating 
an improvement in electrochemical capacitance due to the 
higher content of oxygen vacancies. Furthermore, 
accompanying the increase of the scan rate from 5 mV s‒1 to 
100 mV s‒1 (Figure S2a-2c,), the peak current rises but the CV 
curves remain similar which demonstrates the high rate 
capability and the enhanced reversibility of the OVR-Co3O4
 NSs 
compared with the pristine-Co3O4
 NSs and H200-Co3O4
 NSs. In 
addition, the asymmetry existing between the positive sweeps 
and their corresponding negative sweeps as observed in the 
three Co3O4
 NSs indicates the kinetic irreversibility in the redox 
process due to polarization and ohmic resistance during the 
Faradic process.18 
The specific capacitances of the three kinds of Co3O4
nanosheets at various current densities can be evaluated from 
the charge–discharge curves in Figure 4b (1 A g‒1) and Figure 
S2d-2f (1-32 A g‒1), and the results are presented in Figure 4c. 
It’s clear that the specific capacitances of pristine-Co3O4
 NSs, 
H200-Co3O4
 NSs, and OVR-Co3O4
 NSs increase in turn, 
according to the order of their oxygen vacancies contents. 
Remarkably, the OVR-Co3O4
 NSs electrode manifests ultrahigh 
specific capacitance values of 2195, 2039, 1990, 1834, 1639 
and 1591 F g‒1 at current densities of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 A g‒1
, 
respectively. The typical specific capacitance values of 2195 F 
g
‒1 at 1 A g‒1 is 3.6 times and 2.6 times as high as the values 
belonging to the pristine-Co3O4
 NSs and H200-Co3O4
 NSs 
electrode, respectively. The specific capacitances, in this study, 
are superior to those of most reports based on various 
nanostructures, such as mesoporous Co3O4
 nanowires,11 3Dnanonet hollow structured Co3O4
,
15 Co3O4
 thin sheets,4, 19
Co3O4
 box-in-box nanocages.20 Furthermore, the volumetric 
capacitance of the electrode is also calculated. Figure S3 
exhibits the superior volumetric capacitance of OVR-Co3O4
 NSs 
in comparison to those of the cobalt oxide/sulfide-based 
electrodes.21 The electrochemical performance of OVR-Co3O4
NSs in supercapacitance could be significantly enhanced 
because of two major improvements after treated with NaBH4
. 
First, the reduction treatment increased the ratio of Co2+/Co3+
, 
indicating a higher percentage of CoO species in Co3O4
, CoO 
possesses a higher theoretical capacitance of 4292 F g‒1
.
22 So 
the increased ratio of Co2+/Co3+ can improve the theoretical 
capacitance of the electrode materials. Second, OVR-Co3O4
NSs exhibit improved electrochemical conductivity that 
promotes the transport of charge carriers. The electrical 
conductivity of the OVR-Co3O4
 NSs (7.30×10-3 S m‒1) is one 
order of magnitude higher than that of the pristine-Co3O4
 NSs 
(2.87×10‒4 S m‒1). Furthermore, the OVR-Co3O4
 NSs electrode 
demonstrates a better rate performance than that of the 
pristine-Co3O4
 NSs electrode. The specific capacitance of the 
OVR-Co3O4
 NSs electrode has a good retention of 72.5% as the
current density increases from 1 A g‒1 to 32 A g‒1, compared with the retention of 68% of pristine-Co3O4
 NSs. Meanwhile, 
Figure S4 shows the specific capacitances of the three samples 
from the CV curves at different scan rates. The decrease in 
specific capacitance of OVR-Co3O4
 NSs is about 36% with the 
scan rate increasing from 5 mV s‒1 to 100 mV s‒1, which is 
better than those of H200-Co3O4
 NSs (48%) and pristine-Co3O4
NSs (60%). The improved rate capacitance in OVR-Co3O4
 NSs 
electrode should be ascribed to the enhanced electrical 
conductivity of electrode because the three kinds of Co3O4
 NSs 
possess almost the same shape/size.
Figure 4d shows typical Nuquist plots of the three samples 
measured in an open-circuit condition. Obviously, the internal 
resistances of the OVR-Co3O4
 NSs is evaluated to be 
approximately 0.156 Ω, which is much smaller than those of 
pristine-Co3O4
 NSs and H200-Co3O4
 NSs (0.359 and 0.278 Ω, 
respectively). Moreover, the charge transfer resistance (the 
diameter of the semicircle in the impedance spectrum) of 
OVR- Co3O4
 NSs decreases to 0.122 Ω, which is significantly 
smaller than the values of recently reported Co3O4
nanostructures,11 again showing the improved conductivity 
and faster charge transport of the Co3O4
 NSs electrode after 
the introduction of the oxygen vacancies. The cycling stability 
of these two kinds of Co3O4
 NSs is evaluated at a constant 
current density of 2 A g‒1 for 3000 cycles. As shown in Figure 
4e, the capacitance retaining percentage over 95% of the 
highest values for OVR-Co3O4
 NSs compared with 90% for 
pristine-Co3O4
 NSs, showing enhanced cycling stability. 
Therefore, based on the identical shape/size of the three kinds 
of Co3O4
 NSs, the introduction of pure oxygen vacancies can
result in an enhanced conductivity and thus a great increment 
of capacitance. Without complicated hierarchical/composite 
design, the rich oxygen vacancies combined with 2D 
morphology can lead OVR-Co3O4
 NSs to ultrahigh specific 
capacitance and remarkable rate capability/cycling stability. 
In summary, a set of identical Co3O4
 nanosheets (NSs) with 
varied contents of oxygen vacancies are fabricated by different 
reduction treatments to examine the effects of pure oxygen 
vacancies over the intrinsic conductivity, the structure, 
chemistry, and supercapacitor performance. The more oxygen 
vacancies lead to the higher electrical conductivity and 
utilization efficiency of electroactive surface as well as higher 
Co2+/Co3+ ratio, which can obviously improve the 
pseudocapacitive charge storage properties of Co3O4
nanosheets. This study reveals the importance of the 
combination of two dimensional morphology and rich oxygen 
vacancies in transition metal oxides for advanced 
pseudocapacitive supercapacitor materials.

14_int.txt,"Flexible and lightweight electronic and electrical gadgets have 
attracted significant attention in recent years because of their 
foldability, wearablity, and conformability.[1–4] In this regard, 
highly efficient and flexible energy storage device is essential 
for providing a stable and durable output.[5] Supercapacitor 
is the state-of-the-art device, which exhibits high power density, fast charge−discharge, good cycle life, and reversibility,but their energy density is still much 
lower compared with that of lithiumion batteries and fuel cells.[6–10] Hence, 
it is highly desirable to exploit advanced 
supercapacitors for providing higher 
energy density while maintaining power 
delivery for practical applications.[11,12]
The energy density (E) is usually limited 
to the supercapacitor capacitance (C) and 
the cell voltage (V) according to the equation E = 1/2 CV2
. Asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) can enhance the specific 
capacitance by introducing pseudocapacitive materials and increase the operating 
voltage by coupling different positive and 
negative electrode with opposite potential window,[13,14] resulting in a notable 
improvement of the energy density. Much 
effort has been dedicated to explore various ASC, which usually employ carbonbased materials as negative electrode 
because of their large specific surface area, 
good electrical conductivity, fast charging/
discharging kinetics,[15] but their low specific capacitance limits the energy density of ASC, and hence 
metal oxide-based anodes such as MoO3−x, VN, and FeOx have 
shown promise for ASC due to their higher specific capacitance 
than carbon-based materials.[9,16,17] Bi2O3 have been reported 
to be particularly promising since it is cheap, easy fabrication material with suitable negative working window and high 
theoretical specific capacitance (1370 F g−1
).[18–25] Bi2O3 and its 
composite materials consisting of the hierarchical rippled Bi2O3
nanobelts,[26] Bi2O3 films,[27] Bi2O3/activated carbon,[28] Bi2O3/
MnO2,
[22] and Bi2O3/reduced graphene (GN) oxide[29] have been 
studied, and the special capacitance can reach 250, 98, 332.6, 
139.4, and 94 F g−1, respectively. It is noteworthy that the capacitance of Bi2O3 is far lower than that of theoretical value, and 
therefore, it is urgent to develop effective way to address the 
low specific capacitance issue. Recent theoretical studies demonstrate that introducing surface oxygen vacancies in the metal 
oxide materials opens up new ways to enhance the specific 
capacitance. For instance, Lu et al. prepared the composites 
of H-TiO2 by annealing TiO2 in hydrogen atmosphere, which 
exhibited excellent performance in supercapacitors.[30] Wang 
et al. recently reported the fabrication of reduced mesoporous 
Co3O4 nanowires and a high capacity (978 F g−1 under 2 A g−1
) 
can be achieved,[31] suggesting that a 3.4-fold increase from the 
reducing treatment compared with pristine Co3O4 nanowires (288 F g−1
 at 2 A g−1). To the best of our knowledge, there is 
no report on Bi2O3 resulted from reducing treatment, and 
the oxygen-deficient Bi2O3 is expected to further enhance the 
capacitive performance. Recently, there are only a few methods 
have been reported for the fabrication of Bi2O3-based flexible 
electrodes. Xu et al. reported the Bi2O3 flexible anode,[12] in 
which flower-like Bi2O3 grown on carbon (CNF) paper with 
large loading amount (9 mg cm−2), and the high areal capacitance of 545 and 312 mF cm−2
 can be obtained at the current 
density of 3 and 15 mA cm−2
. Li et al. also demonstrated the 
Bi2O3/CNF negative electrode,[32] which shows an areal capacitance of 783 mF cm−2 at 5 mV s−1 and about 150 mF cm−2 at 
150 mV s−1
 in KOH electrolyte. Despite great progress, for the 
emerging applications, further areal capacitance improvement 
of Bi2O3 film electrode is a vital requirement for flexible supercapacitors. Moreover, the weak rate performance is found in 
this strategy, only 19% retention is obtained as the rate scan 
from 5 mV s−1 to 150 mV s−1
.
[32] Good rate property is based on 
fast ion and electron transfer. GN features ultrahigh electrical 
conductivity and large specific surface area.[33] Thus, the Bi2O3/
GN composite is developed to improve its rate performance. 
The high areal capacitance for flexible electrode requires electrode materials not only with high gravimetric capacitance but 
also with large loading mass, which can be achieved by incorporating porous substrate. Our previous work has demonstrated 
that the bacterial cellulose (BC) is one of the most promising 
supporting substrate for metallic oxide/hydroxide flexible electrodes due to ultrafine nanofiber network structure, remarkable 
mechanical property, good hydrophilic property, and durable 
chemical stability.[34–37]
In this paper, we report a simple and scale-up method for 
the synthesis of oxygen-deficient bismuth oxide (r-Bi2O3)/
GN/BC flexible anode. This electrode exhibits a high loading 
amount, continuous electron transport network, and large ion 
accessible surface area for redox reaction, therefore, remarkable 
areal specific capacitance (6675 mF cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2), ultrahigh gravimetric capacitance (1137 F g−1 at 1 mA cm−2
), and 
good rate performance (56.2% retention from 1 mA cm−2
 to 
50 mA cm−2
) can be obtained. A flexible supercapacitor prepared with r-Bi2O3/GN/BC anode and Co3O4/GN/BC cathode 
shows a maximum cell voltage of 1.6 V with a high areal capacitance of 1263 mF cm−2 at 2 mA cm−2
, good rate performance of 
41% retention at 50 mA cm−2, and good cycle stability of 88% 
retention after 3000 cycles. Astonishingly, this flexible supercapacitor exhibits a maximum energy density of 0.449 mWh cm−2
(7.74 mWh cm−3) and a high power density of 40 mW cm−2
(690 mW cm−3)"
15_int.txt,"Rising global population and the global energy crisis has 
led to concerns regarding electrical energy generation and 
consumption. There is therefore a need for an alternative 
energy storage device that has a higher capacity than the 
current technologies. Prior to now, the storage of electrical 
energy has been exclusively based on batteries and capacitors. Batteries have been the most utilized and preferred candidate, owing to high energy capacity coupled with insubstantial power evolved. However, when substantial energy is 
required at high power, capacitors remain the suitable device 
to date. Despite their benefts, both batteries and capacitors are inadequate for storing high energy and power density required for efective consumption and performance of 
renewable energy systems (Najib and Erdem 2019). Inventors and innovators in the feld have been encountering 
bottlenecks with current solutions such as short lifecycles 
and shelf lives associated with batteries. This was only the 
case until revolutionary trends brought about applications 
of nanotechnology in the manufacturing of electrical appliances and large storage capacity devices (Burke and Zhao 
2015). Nanotechnology is an advancement in the feld of 
technology that deals with manipulation and regulation of 
substances on a nanoscale measurement, employing scientifc skills from a diverse biomedical and industrial approach 
(Soares et al. 2018). Nanoparticles, a nano-size object that 
has three external nanoscale dimensions is the fundamental constituent of nanotechnology, while nanomaterials are 
materials with interior or exterior structures on the nanoscale 
dimension (Anu and Saravanakumar 2017; Jeevanandam 
et al. 2018). Nanomaterials possess unique chemical and 
physical characteristics that ofer advantages and promotes 
them as an appropriate candidate for extensive utilization 
in felds such as electronics (Kang et al. 2015) and supercapacitors, where the storage of energy is required (Saha et al. 
2018). It is now evident that the energy storage system is 
an important way to ofer a solution to the rising demand in 
world energy generation and consumption (Nocera 2009).
Supercapacitors are electrochemical energy storage 
devices possessing both great power density and energy density with long lifecycle and high charging/discharging (Sun 
et al. 2018a). These properties are the reason for high-energy 
storage ability exhibited by supercapacitors for technological 
advancement (Chen and Dai 2013). SCs have been described 
as a capacitor that ofers high storage space, larger than other 
capacitors with low internal resistance, which viaducts the 
gap between rechargeable cells and the conventional capacitors. In addition to high power capacity and longevity, low 
weight, large heat range of −40 °C to 70 °C, ease to package and afordable maintenance are the main advantages 
supercapacitors have over other devices that stores energy 
(Wang et al. 2009). The components of supercapacitors are 
an electrolyte, two electrodes and a separator which electrically isolate the two electrodes. These electrodes represent 
the most essential and fundamental constituent of supercapacitors (Pope et al. 2013; Iro et al. 2016); hence, the 
performance of the supercapacitors largely depends on the 
electrochemical properties of electrodes, the voltage range 
and the electrolyte. Iro et al. (2016) reported that applications of supercapacitors such as the ability to compliment 
the power of battery usage during emergency power supplies 
and in electric vehicle power systems are largely dependent 
on its useful attributes. Wide usefulness of supercapacitors 
has been described in fuel cell vehicles, low-emission hybrid 
vehicles, electric vehicles, forklifts, power quality upgrading 
and load cranes (Miller and Simon 2008; Cai et al. 2016). 
Fabrication of supercapacitors using printing technology 
has utilized diverse nanomaterials such as conductive polymers, electrolytes, transition metal carbides, transition metal 
dichalcogenides, nitrides and hydroxides (Sun et al. 2018a).
Magnetic metal oxide nanoparticles represent an attractive type of materials among inorganic solids because they 
are cheap and easy to prepare in large quantities (Masala 
and Seshadri 2004). Among diferent magnetic materials, 
spinel ferrites and inorganic perovskite oxides have superior 
performance as an electrode in supercapacitor applications. 
The emerging evidence has revealed that spinel ferrites of 
diferent elements are currently applicable in the design of 
supercapacitor energy storage devices. Spinel ferrite nanomaterials possess a high energy density, durability and good 
capacitance retention, high power and efective long-term 
stability (Elkholy et al. 2017; Liang et al. 2020). Recently, 
manganese zinc ferrite (MnZnFe2O4) nanoneedles were successfully synthesized, with higher specifc capacitance than 
that of MnFe2O4 and ZnFe2O4. More so, the nanoneedles 
fabricated were found to exhibit a high surface area, powerful long-term stability and very high columbic efectiveness, which makes it suitable for supercapacitors application (Ismail et al. 2018). Perovskite oxides are functional 
nanomaterials that have received great attention to potential applications, and it has been widely employed in the 
fabrication of anion-intercalation supercapacitors. These 
nanomaterials are greatly infuenced by valence state of 
B-site element, surface area and internal resistance. More 
importantly, research on energy and power densities of 
perovskite oxides are scanty (Nan et al. 2019; Ding et al. 
2017). Design of La-based perovskite with high density, 
wide voltage window and high energy capacity for a fexible supercapacitor application was reported in the literature (Ma et al. 2019a). Although, the transition metal oxides 
have relatively poor conductivity and thus poor capacitance. 
Therefore, an oxygen replacement with sulfur was recently 
performed which led to transition metal sulfides. They 
have been viewed as materials capable of application in the fabrication of supercapacitors owing to their characteristics 
such as good electrical conductivity, high specifc capacitance, electrochemical redox sites and minimal electronegativity, which led to the synthesis of ternary nanostructures 
like Co0.33Fe0.67S2 in supercapacitors application (Liu et al. 
2018a). In addition, the highly fexible, lightweight asymmetric supercapacitor “graphene fbers/NiCo2S4” was fabricated with an extremely high value of both energy density 
and volumetric capacity (Cai et al. 2016). This was in search 
for a more durable and efcient energy storage device with 
high volumetric capacity, high energy density and wide voltage window. The partially substituting Co by the transition 
metals (i.e., Zn, Mn, Ni, and Cu) in the Co3O4 lattice leads 
to produce an inverse spinel structure, in which the external 
cation occupies the B-sites, while cobalt occupies both the 
A- and B-sites (Kim et al. 2014). This presents efective 
channels for ion difusion enrichment toward charge carriers (electrons or holes) that jump into the A-site and B-site 
for high electrical conduction (Liu et al. 2018b). ZnCo2O4
nanoparticles show the specifc capacitance values of 202, 
668 and 843, 432 F g−1 (Bhagwan et al. 2020). The electrochemical characteristics of transition metal sulfdes are 
much better than the electrochemical properties of transmission metal oxides. This can be explained by the presence 
of sulfur atoms instead of oxygen atoms. Hence, the lower 
electronegativity of sulfur than that of oxygen facilitates 
electron transfer in the metal sulfde structure easier than 
that in the metal oxide form. Thus, replacing oxygen with 
sulfur, providing more fexibility for nanomaterials synthesis 
and fabrication (Jiang et al. 2016). Li et al. (2019a) have 
found that the ZnCo2S4 electrode displays an extraordinary 
specifc capacitance ~1269 F g−1, which is 4 multiplies of 
those for Zn–Co ferrite electrode (~296 F g−1), due to the 
ZnCo2S4 electrode having low charge-transfer resistance, 
and likewise, exceptional ion difusion rate compared with 
achieved from the ZnCo2O4 electrode.
Furthermore, graphene and carbon nanotubes are carbonderived nanomaterials that have received great attention in 
their potential application as efcient electrode materials in 
the design of supercapacitors owing to their high mechanical properties with great specifc surface area and most 
importantly competent electrical properties (Chen and Dai 
2013). Further, other forms of carbon-nanomaterials like 
carbon derivatives, xerogel, carbon fber, activated carbon 
and template carbon likewise been applied in the design of 
supercapacitors and they also serve as the supercapacitor’s 
electrodes. These materials possess powerful lifecycles, 
durable power density, lasting cycle durability and desirable columbic reliability (Yin et al. 2014). Carbon-based 
nanomaterials are relatively cheap, readily accessible and 
very common with characteristic permeability which enables 
easy penetration of electrolytes into the electrodes, to boost 
the capacitance of the supercapacitors. Besides, its huge 
surface area and efective conductance of electricity make 
them applicable in electric supercapacitors with double layer 
(Yang et al. 2019a; Cheng et al. 2020a). In the same context, 
the extraordinary specifc surface area and conductivity are 
demanded to secure excellent capacity achievement for the 
electrodes. Therefore, mineral oxide, two-dimensional carbon composites and polymer composites that possess high 
conductivity are normally utilized in electric devices with a 
high display. Especially, two-dimensional carbon composites 
improve capacity achievement via enhancing their surface 
area, porosity and electric conducting. Notwithstanding this 
level of concern, ZnCo2O4 efciency needs more promotion 
by morphological and chemical modifcations (Kathalingam 
et al. 2020). Hence, the incorporation of nitrogen-doped graphene oxide and polyaniline with the ZnCo2O4 afects on 
electrochemical performance. The prepared electrode exhibited a high capacity of about 720 F g−1 and retained ~96% 
from its original capacitance over 10×103
 cycles (Kathalingam et al. 2020). Also, the fabricated ZnCo2S4@hydrothermal carbon spheres/Fe2O3@pyrolyzed polyaniline nanotubes unveiled a high capacitance about~150 mA h g−1 and 
retained 82% from its original capacity after 6x103 cycles 
and confrming huge energy density (~ 85 W h kg−1) at a 
moderate power density of 460 W kg−1 (Hekmat et al. 2020).
The conducting polymer materials are pseudo-capacitance materials with poor lifecycles when compared with 
carbon-based materials (Snook et al. 2010). Numerous good 
properties of conducting polymer materials like fexibility, 
conductivity, ease of synthesis, fnancial viability and high 
pseudo-capacitance conducting polymer materials such as 
polythiophene, polypyrrole and polyaniline have received 
great attention in the potential supercapacitor application. 
Despite these good properties, pure conducting polymer 
materials exhibit poor cycling stability and lower power and 
energy densities (Huang et al. 2017a).
This review focuses on spinel ferrites MFe2O4, MMoO4
and MCo2O4, where M denotes a transition metal ion. 
Additional focus areas include perovskite oxides, transition 
metals sulfdes, carbon materials and conducting polymer 
materials, as materials that have been extensively and widely 
employed in the fabrication of supercapacitors to establish 
loopholes in some of these nanomaterials. This would ultimately ofer guidelines on how to design better energy storage devices with a higher power, density and sufcient storage ability."
16_int.txt,"Compared with traditional fuel cells or lithium-ion batteries, 
supercapacitors exhibit higher power density, faster recharge 
capability and longer lifecycle, and these advantages make 
them promising for next-generation high-efficient energy 
storage devices. 1, 2 Depending on the type of charging storage 
mechanism, supercapacitors can be classified into two 
categories: electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs), where 
charge is stored by charge accumulation at the electrodeelectrolyte interface, and pseudocapacitors that store charge 
by the fast and reversible redox reactions take place on or near 
the surface of the electrodes. 3, 4 Compared to EDLCs, 
pseudocapacitors show much higher specific capacitance 
because the charge storage associated with redox reactions is 
substantially expanded, which will lead to a higher energy 
density. Among numerous pseudocapacitive materials (such as 
RuO2
, Nb2O5
, Co3O4
 and Mn3O4
, etc), Co3O4
 is particularly 
attractive for application in supercapacitors due to its simple 
synthetic process and extremely high theoretical specific 
capacitance (3560 F g-1). 5-9 However, its experimental values 
usually range between 300 and 1000 F g-1 in most previous 
reports, which are much lower than its theoretical values. 10-12
As we all know, the electrochemical performance for 
pseudocapacitive materials is primarily determined by the 
surface or near-surface chemistry, where the highly active 
surface can provide sufficient electroactive sites for the fast 
and efficient redox reactions. 13, 14 Unfortunately, the intrinsic 
poor electronic conductivity for Co3O4
 limits the transfer of 
electrons, leading to the modest reaction kinetics. Thus, only 
part of the active materials can take part in the 
electrochemical charge storage process, which result in the 
low utilization of active materials and specific capacitance. 15 In 
addition, the redox reaction is usually associated with a 
noticeable volume change, which will cause the interaction 
between the nanocrystals, leading to the peeling of the 
electrode material and thus reduce the cycle life. 16
To overcome these problems, many approaches have been 
intensely investigated. For example, to increase the contact 
area between the active material and the electrolyte, Xia et al 
reported the phosphate ion functionalized Co3O4
 ultrathin 
nanosheets. The functionalized ultrathin nanosheets can 
significantly reduce the charge transfer resistance and increase 
the active reaction sites, causing the improved utilization of 
the active material as well as improved reactivity and 
pseudocapacitive performance. 13 Despite significant progress, 
however, the delicate fabrication process as well as the ultralow active material loading (0.56 mg) makes them less viable for large-scale practical applications. Another important route 
for increasing the specific capacitance of Co3O4
 is to improve 
the electrical conductivity through the introduction of oxygen 
vacancies. 17, 18 Such as, Liu and co-workers reported that 
oxygen vacancy abundant ultrafine Co3O4/Graphene electrode 
delivers a high specific capacitance of 978 F g-1 at a current 
density of 1 A g-1
. 
7
 Even though previous research to improve 
the electrochemical performance of Co3O4
 has made great 
strides, further research to improve its specific capacitance is 
needed.
Metal palladium, a precious metal, has been widely studied on 
gas sensor or oxygen reduction. 19, 20 These studies have shown 
that the introduction of palladium or other precious metals 
may reduce the crystallinity of certain metal oxides by 
inhibiting the growth of crystal grains, which may affect some 
of their performance. 20, 21 However, there are few studies that 
explore the effects of Pd on the electrochemical performance 
of pseudo-capacitance materials, especially for Co3O4
. In this 
paper, Pd nanoparticles were introduced into Co3O4
 (Pd-Co3O4
) 
by adding PdCl2
 as palladium source during the hydrothermal 
process. It has been found that the introduction of Pd can 
affect the growth of Co3O4
 nanocrystalline, which caused the 
disordered lattice orientation and smaller nanocrystalline, 
resulting in the reduced crystallinity of Co3O4
. The amorphous 
nanostructure caused by the reduced crystallinity is favorable 
for both electrolyte penetration and fast ion/electron transfer, 
which ensure sufficient electroactive sites exposed to the 
electrolyte for fast redox reaction and lead to enhanced 
electrochemical reactivity. 14, 22 More importantly, the high 
density of grain boundaries contributes to the increase of 
oxygen vacancies, which will lead to the enhanced conductivity 
of electrode. Benefiting from these advantages, the poor 
crystalline oxygen vacancy rich Co3O4
 delivers a large specific 
capacitance of 1353 F g-1 at a current density of 7 mA cm-2
, 
which is almost two times the capacitance of pristine Co3O4
. 
The improved electrode materials also exhibit higher rate 
capability and more excellent cycling stability. An aqueous 
asymmetric supercapacitor based on Pd-Co3O4
 and carbon 
cloth electrode has been successfully fabricated, which 
demonstrates a high energy density of 4.7 mWh cm-3 and 
excellent cycling stability. Moreover, a smart watch can be 
powered by two devices in series, demonstrating a good 
flexibility and practicality."
17_int.txt,"With the increasing demand for portable and wearable electronic
devices, flexible supercapacitors have been developed because of their
higher power density and longer cycling performance than those of
lithium ion batteries (LIBs); however, their relatively lower energy
density than those of LIBs impedes their practical applications [1,2]. The
improvement of energy density for supercapacitors can be achieved by
increasing the specific capacitance or maximizing the cell voltage [3].
Recently, an effective approach that broadens the energy density of
supercapacitors is to construct an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) by
combining high capacity battery-type electrode and high rate capacitive
electrode [4,5]. In general, ASC devices are mostly operated in aqueous
electrolytes, which easily suffer from solvent evaporation and possible
leakage of harmful electrolytes [6,7]. By contrast, quasi/all-solid-state
ASC devices with gel electrolytes are preferred to avoid this problem
and provide additional advantages, such as lightweight, high mechanical
integrity, good reliability, and wide operating temperature [8,9]. In this regard, solid-state ASC devices have been widely explored as an alternative to next-generation portable and flexible electronics. However,
studies have yet to overcome development of high-energy solid-state ASC
devices without sacrificing their power density and life span.
Extensive research efforts have been devoted to the development of
desirable battery-type materials (e.g., nickel and cobalt compounds) in
electrochemical energy storage systems, such as supercapacitors, LIBs
and rechargeable alkaline batteries owing to their high theoretical capacity, low cost, and abundance in nature [10–12]. Among them, cobalt
manganese oxides with multiple oxidation states in particular are
considered attractive because they combine the prominent features of the
extremely high theoretical capacity of Co3O4 and high rate capability of
MnO2 [13]. Nevertheless, they still suffer from these disadvantages, such
as low electrical conductivity, sluggish kinetics, and poor electrochemical stability, thus limiting their implementation in real applications. Very recently, substitutional anion-doping in transition metal
oxides has been demonstrated as an effective approach to tune electrochemical and electrical properties of metal oxide electrodes [14]. Liang
et al. reported that by incorporating fluorine (F) dopant in NiFe-based
oxide electrode, remarkable specific capacitance of 670 F cm3
(134 mF cm2
) can be achieved [15]. Previous density functional theory
(DFT) studies showed that the substitution of F for O in Fe2O3 improves
electrical conductivity because of the generation of defect levels and the
decreased band gap after F dopants, thereby facilitating the reaction kinetics of Fe2O3 toward a photoelectrochemical processes [16]. In addition, the highly ionic nature of the metal-fluorine bond that can provide
higher lattice energy and suppress the polarization with respect to their
oxide counterparts, and thus increases redox potential of electrode materials [17,18]. On the other hand, the intentional creation of O vacancies
in the lattice of transition metal oxides has been proven as an effective
approach to increase the reactivity of electrochemically active sites and
to modify electrical properties [19,20], which are beneficial to
enhancement of electrochemical performance. Kim et al. [21] reported
that O vacancy-induced α-MoO3 efficiently increased the carrier concentration and promoted a faster charge storage kinetics than those of
fully oxidized α-MoO3, thereby remarkably enhancing electrochemical
performance. However, the combined effects of F dopant and O vacancies
on the electronic structure and electrochemical properties of transition
metal oxides in energy storage systems have been rarely studied.
Herein, we report an effective strategy to boost the electrochemical
performance of F-Co2MnO4-x nanowires grown on carbon fiber (CF) as
excellent electrode materials for supercapacitor through introducing F
heteroatoms and O vacancies. The enhanced electrochemical performances of F-Co2MnO4-x nanowires are comprehensively studied by
theoretical calculations and experimental analyses. The resultant FCo2MnO4-x/CF exhibits high specific capacity and good cyclic stability.
Moreover, a flexible quasi-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC)
with F-Co2MnO4-x/CF as the positive electrode and Fe2O3/CF as the
negative electrode yields a high energy density of 64.4 W h kg1 at a high
power density of 800 W kg1
. This ASC device also retains 24.2 W h kg1
even at an ultrahigh power density of 8000 W kg1 and a long cycling life
(95.4% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles). In addition, the device
shows 89.9% retention of the initial specific capacitance at 10 mV1 over
2000 bending cycles at a bending angle from 0 to 30."
18_int.txt,"Problems regarding energy shortage are increasing due to the 
exhaustion of fossil fuels, the use of which is unsustainable.[1–5]
As a result, the search for alternatives is encouraged.[6–9] Tremendous effort has been paid toward exploitation of renewable 
energy, including solar, hydro, tidal energy, etc.; however, 
the continuity and stability of the transferred electricity 
cannot be assured due to seasonal and geographical variations.[10–13] Hence, it is essential to focus on the development of electricity-storage devices with capable 
performance.[14–19]
Significant attention has been paid in 
academia and industry to supercapacitors (SCs), also known as electrochemical 
capacitors or ultracapacitors, due to their 
outstanding advantages in terms of high 
power density, excellent rate capability, fast 
charging/discharging rate, outstanding 
durability, and low cost.[20,21] Thus, they have 
been identified as a promising candidate 
for high-performance energy storage.[22–24]
Figure 1 compares the power and energy 
densities of various energy-storage devices. 
It is obvious that SCs play a vital role in 
narrowing the gap between batteries and 
conventional capacitors, as they can be 
endowed with substantially higher power 
densities than conventional capacitors, and 
they also have greater energy densities than 
batteries. Additionally, the unique chargestorage mechanism of SCs enables them to 
be charged/discharged at a high rate and maintain a long-term 
stability, assuring their utilization in high-power-demanding electronics. This is basically difficult to achieve with batteries.[25,26]
Thus, SCs occupy an indispensable position among the variety of 
energy-storage devices.
According to the charge-storage mechanism, SCs are 
generally categorized into electrical double-layer capacitors 
(EDLCs)[27,28] and pseudocapacitors (PCs).[29,30] EDLCs store 
electrical charge by accumulating electrostatic charges at the 
interface between the electrode and electrolyte, which is a physical process without faradic reactions.[31] Therefore, the effective 
surface area of the electrode materials has a great influence 
on the capacitance of EDLCs.[32] Carbon-based materials, containing activated carbon (AC), carbon nanotubes (CNTs), 
and graphene, are commonly used as electrode materials for 
EDLCs, owing to their wide range of sources, large surface 
area, and high electrical conductivity.[33–35] Although EDLCs 
can achieve high power density and long-lifetime stability, their 
energy densities are relatively low due to the low capacitance 
of these carbon materials. In contrast, PCs based on metal 
oxides[36–38] and conductive polymers as active materials[39,40]
can deliver specific energy densities that are several orders of 
magnitude higher, since they utilize fast and reversible oxidation/reduction (redox) reactions for energy storage. Most 
PCs, however, suffer from poor cyclic stability and low power 
density. In fact, the mechanisms of both EDLCs and PCs are interfacial phenomena, and can operate simultaneously if the 
electrodes are well designed. To fully incorporate the merits of 
the EDLCs and PCs, asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) (also 
named hybrid supercapacitors or battery-capacitor supercapacitors) have been developed.[41–44] As shown in Figure 2, ASCs are 
typically composed of two dissimilar electrodes (a Faradaic positive electrode and a capacitor-type negative electrode), a separator, an electrolyte, and the current collector. In comparison 
to symmetric SCs, ASCs take advantage of the different voltage 
windows of the two different electrodes to increase the range 
of the device’s operating voltage (up to 2.0 V even in aqueous 
electrolytes), and improving the energy density. Specifically, 
electrode materials that are dominated by Faradaic reactions 
such as metal oxides (RuO2,
[45,46] MnO2,
[47–51] NiO,[52,53] V2O5,
[10]
etc.), metal sulfides (NiCo2S4,
[54] MoS2,
[55] CoS2,
[56,57] NiS,[57]
etc.) and conductive polymers (polyaniline (PANI),[3] polypyrrole (PPy),[13,58,59] poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (PEDOT)[60]) 
are normally applied as positive electrodes in ASCs due to 
their high specific capacitance. Carbon-based materials (AC,[43]
CNTs,[61] graphene,[62–64] and carbon fibers[65]), metal nitrides 
(TiN,[7] VN,[66] MoN,[67] and so on), and some metal oxides 
(FeOx
[60] and MoOx
[68]) are usually employed as negative electrodes because of their fast charging/discharging rate and suitable working window at negative potential.In recent years, the development of ASCs has been quite 
rapid and different kinds of ASCs have been explored.[69,70]
However, with the fast growth of portable electronic devices 
and vehicles, ASCs cannot yet meet the demands, as a primary power source, of modern portable devices and electronic 
vehicles due to their relatively low energy density. Thus, it is 
necessary to enhance the energy density of ASCs without sacrificing their power density and service life. The energy density 
(E, W, h) of an SC device is determined by its capacitance and 
cell voltage, (Equation (1)), and the power density (P, W) can be 
calculated according to Equation (2)
= 2
2
E CV (1)
= 1
4 s
2 P
R
V (2)
In Equations (1) and (2), C is the capacitance of the device, 
V is the working voltage window, and Rs is the equivalent inner 
resistance of the SC device. Based on Equations (1) and (2), 
it would seem that the direct approach to enhance the energy 
density of the ASCs is by increasing V or/and C while reducing 
Rs. The C of an ASC device can be equivalent to the negative 
electrode capacitance (Cn) and positive electrode capacitance 
(Cp) connected in series, shown in Figure 3, which can be calculated using Equation (3) C Cn p C (3)
The C of the ASC reaches maximum value when Cn is equal 
to Cp. Thus, by balancing the charge between the positive and 
negative electrodes optimized performance can be achieved. 
The charge-storage capability of an electrode material is dominated by its physical and chemical properties, including the 
specific surface area, electronic conductivity, ionic diffusion 
rate, surface reaction activity, etc. On the other hand, the voltage 
window of ASCs is limited by the decomposition voltage of 
the electrolyte and the interaction between the electrode and 
the electrolyte. Therefore, ASCs with a higher energy density 
can be explored in the following two ways: (i) developing electrode materials with high capacitance, high conductivity, and 
high stability; and (ii) optimizing the electrodes and/or electrolytes to increase the working-voltage window. For instance, the 
working voltage of an SC device is normally less than 1 V in an 
aqueous electrolyte, but in the range of ≈2–3 V in nonaqueous 
(organic and ionic liquid) electrolytes because of their higher 
dissociation voltage.[71–73] However, studies on ASCs in organic 
electrolytes are still rare. Wang and co-workers adopted a quasisolid-state organic electrolyte for flexible ASCs, obtaining an 
ultrawide operating-voltage window of 2.6 V and a high energy 
density of 58.2 Wh kg−1
 (4.87 mWh cm−3
) at a power density of 
0.37 kW kg−1
 (0.031 W cm−3
).[74] Overall, referring to the optimization of C or V, exploiting efficient and low-cost electrode 
materials with excellent capacitive performance is proposed to 
be the direction of future studies.
An ideal electrode material should possess the following 
features: (i) high capacitance, (ii) low electrical resistance, 
(iii) good cycling stability, (iv) low cost, (v) wide voltage window, 
(vi) nontoxicity or low toxicity, and (vii) natural abundance. 
However, there is currently no material that has been found, 
which satisfies all the requirements above. For instance, 
although transition-metal oxides, such as MnO2,
[75,76] Nb2O5,
[77]
NiO,[52] and FeOx,
[60] have been applied as both positive electrodes and negative electrodes in ASCs due to the quite large 
capacitance, the major obstacles for the widespread application 
of these metal oxides are their connatural poor electrical conductivity as a result of their semiconductor nature, leading to 
low power densities and capacitances (Table 1). The theoretical 
pseudocapacitance of metal oxides can be calculated as
= ×
×
C n F
M V (4)
where n is the mean number of the electrons transferred in the 
redox reaction, F is the Faraday constant, M is the molar mass 
of the metal oxide, and V is the operating voltage window. To 
promote the conductivity of metal oxides, multistrategies have 
been designed and employed, including the construction of 
nanostructures and hybrid architectures with carbon materials, 
defects introduction, element doping, and so on.[78] A hierarchical MnO2 nanoparticles/CNT sponge showed an energy density of 31 Wh kg−1
 with a high power density of 63 kW kg−1
.
[79]
A new mesostructured NiO/Ni composite consisting of heteroNiO/Ni components and a 3D porous architecture achieved 
an ultrahigh specific capacity of up to 1204 C g−1
 for NiO only 
and 522 C g−1 for the NiO/Ni composite at 1 A g−1
.
[80] Gogotsi 
and co-workers recently fabricated a hydrophilic restacked 
MoN nanosheet film, which delivered a high volumetric 
capacitance of 928 F cm−3
 and good rate performance.[81] Conversely, carbon-based materials are highly desirable for power 
sources but display a limited energy density as a result of their EDLC storage mechanism. At present, the main direction for 
advancing carbon-based materials is the construction of nanostructures with high surface area and rich pores, which can 
increase their number of active sites and conductivity.[82] For 
instance, Salunkhe et al. utilized metal-organic frameworks 
(MOFs) as precursors for the preparation of nanoporous carbons (NPCs) with high porosity, making it possible to control 
their porous architectures, pore volumes, surface areas, etc. 
The interesting properties of these MOF-derived NPCs enable 
them to be applied in high-performance SCs.[83]
In this context, here, we review the recent progress of some 
smart strategies for achieving high-energy ASCs in terms of 
mechanism and electrochemical performance. We focus on 
the ingenious methods to increase the capacitance of electrode 
materials, including intrinsic defects (oxygen vacancies and 
sulfur vacancies) engineering, element doping, and surface 
functionalization, etc. Furthermore, the available approaches of 
modulating electrolyte and electrode materials as well as their 
surface charges to broaden the voltage window of ASCs are 
also highlighted. Finally, we summarize the main challenges 
and propose the new trends in the design of high-performance 
ASCs."
19_int.txt,"Supercapacitors (SCs) exhibit many outstanding properties compared to conventional 
dielectric capacitors and batteries, such as higher energy and power density, fast charging and 
discharging, and long cycle life for a wide range of applications, such as consumer 
electronics, medical electronics, memory backup systems, hybrid electric vehicles, 
transportation, and military defense systems.1-4 However, to satisfy demands in the rapidly 
growing field of energy applications, more efforts have to be expended to the development of 
new electrodes and electrolytes without sacrificing the power density and cycle life.5,6
. 
Over the past few decades, transition metal oxides/hydroxides have been explored for 
use as high energy-density pseudocapacitor electrodes because of their theoretical 
capacitance and abundance.7
 Among the various metal oxides, capacitors based on ruthenium 
oxide (RuO2) show remarkably high specific capacitance and power.8
 However, due to high toxicity and cost, the use of RuO2-based capacitors in practical large-scale production is 
limited.9 Therefore, much effort has been devoted to identifying inexpensive and low-toxicity 
metal oxide electrode materials with reasonable electrochemical properties as alternatives to 
RuO2.
10 In practice, the most important characteristics required for using a metal oxide as a 
capacitor electrode are pseudocapacitive behavior, large surface area, high conductivity, and 
high electrochemical stability.9
 Zinc oxide nanostructures are one of the promising candidates 
for supercapacitors due to their high specific energy density, improved biocompatibility, nontoxicity, good electrochemical activity, low cost, chemical stability, abundant availability and 
environmental friendliness compared to other transition metal oxides.11-13 Additionally, 
nanostructured ZnO possesses some unique physicochemical properties due to the unique 
spatial architecture and large aspect ratio (so also higher active surface area) compared to 
their bulk counterpart to meet some specific device-related demands for supercapacitor 
applications. Studies on the suitability of ZnO as a promising candidate for supercapacitors 
are limited, and there is a need to better understand the behavior of this material in order to 
improve its electrochemical properties. 
In order to exploit the power density of available metal oxide supercapacitors, 
several groups have recently fabricated composite/hybrid electrodes via the modification of 
carbonaceous materials with metal oxides.14,15 Carbon-based materials in the form of powders, 
fibers, aerogels, composites, sheets, monoliths, and tubes have been widely used as electrodes 
because of their low cost, variety of morphology/structure, easy processing, high electrical 
conductivity, improved chemical stability, relatively inert electrochemistry, extremely high 
mechanical strength, controllable porosity, and electro-catalytic active sites for a wide range 
of redox reactions.10,11,16-18 Among these materials, carbon nanofibers (CNFs) are attractive 
electrode additive materials for improving the performance of metal oxide supercapacitors.CNFs have high specific surface area, well-defined hollow cores, and a high aspect ratio 
greater than 106
.
19 Thus, a hybrid nanostructure exploiting the electric double layer 
capacitance of CNF and faradic pseudocapacitance of zinc oxide could be a suitable 
candidate for electrochemical capacitor with high specific capacitance and energy density. 
Although ZnO has been combined with additives like carbon nanotubes, fibers, 
aerogel, and graphene to enhance the pseudocapacitance of composites,20,21 there are several 
issues involved in these types of hybrid/composite materials. For example, the energy and 
power density of the related devices are far from satisfactory and do not meet current market 
demands. A majority of these issues are related to the presence of defects in the carbon 
nanostructures, surface/interfacial states within the nanocomposites, and poor crystallinity of 
the metal oxides. These issues lead to deterioration of the electrical transport properties of the 
hybrid nanomaterials. Therefore, novel composite/hybrid nanomaterials are needed to 
overcome the present obstacles. Generally, post-synthesis heat treatment of hybrid electrodes 
in a vacuum or in a controlled inert atmosphere is expected to improve the structure of the 
carbon nanomaterials or metal oxides by the removal of defects/surface states, leading to 
improved electrical characteristics of the nanocomposites.22
Very few reports describe the role of vacuum-annealing treatment of metal 
oxide/CNT composites (such as MnO2/CNT, RuO2/MWNT, and SnO2/MWNT) to improve 
cycle ability and energy density.23,24 To the best of our knowledge, there is no report on the 
electrochemical properties of ZnO/CNF nanohybrid electrodes that have been heat treated in 
an oxygen-deficient atmosphere for use in supercapacitors. In the present investigation, ZnO 
NPs that are well attached to CNF walls were synthesized via a precipitation process, 
followed by heat-treatment in a vacuum furnace. The novelty of the present work includes (i) 
improved specific capacitance and cyclic performance of the microelectrodes and (ii) a systematic study of the sample properties in terms of oxygen deficiency. The deficiency was 
studied in correlation with the surface morphology, structural/microstructural properties, and 
optical properties of the nanohybrid with the enhanced electrochemical properties for use in 
SC applications. The results could lead to the cost-effective fabrication of novel composite 
electrode materials for superior electrochemical supercapacitors."
20_int.txt,"With the rapid development of emerging technologies such as 
wearable portable electronic devices, hybrid electric vehicles 
and intelligent power grids, the urgent demand for renewable 
energy and new energy storage technology, especially for supercapacitors (SCs), has aroused the interest of many researchers. 
Compared to conventional energy storage devices, SCs have 
higher specific capacity, faster charging and discharging time, 
longer cycle life, and excellent thermal stability. Such properties 
further underlined SCs great potential as an emerging type of 
electrochemical energy storage (EES) system for world’s most advanced adjustable EES device,[1] nanostructured electrode,[2] self-charging power 
textiles,[3] flexible printed circuits,[4] etc. 
As to the electrode material, a high-performance SC electrode generally requires 
high electrical conductivity, large ionaccessible surface area, fast ionic transport 
rate, and good electrochemical stability.[5]
Up to now, numerous efforts have been 
made to design high-performance active 
electrode materials for SCs, including 
morphology controlling,[6] formation of 
composite with carbon-based materials 
(such as graphene and carbon nanotubes),[5,7] transition metal doping,[8] etc. 
For instance, Qu and co-workers reported 
structural nickel–cobalt double hydroxides derived from MOF-74 with high specific capacity and practical energy storage 
applications.[6] Zhao et al. investigated SCs 
based on cobalt/manganese-doped nickel 
hydroxides, which was further combined 
with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and 
delivered superior capacities.[8a] Transition-metal oxides and hydroxides have been studied extensively 
as active EES materials for SCs due to their low cost and high 
specific capacity.[7a,8a,9] Despite the above advantages, SCs based 
on such materials usually exhibit low rate capability, poor electrical conductivity, and complicated fabrication process.[10]
Therefore, it is still a topical challenge to appropriately design 
transition metal based high-performance SCs with controllable 
EES ability.
Among transition metal oxides and hydroxides, a number 
of Mn- or Ni-based-layered double hydroxides (LDH) and their 
derivates were developed as promising candidates for high-performance SCs.[7a,9c,11] For the former one, LDH are a large class 
of layered materials, in which the layers consist of alternatively 
arranged metal cations (divalent, trivalent, and tetravalent) balanced by charge-compensating anions positioned within the 
interlayer space.[12] The highly tunable element composition and 
special layered structure endow it with large specific capacity, 
large ion-accessible surface area, and fast ionic transport rate. 
Besides, LDH were reported to possess abundant oxygen vacancies, which can facilitate the electrochemical charge transfer by 
creating midgap electronic states, hence increasing the electrical conductivity and electrochemical stability of SCs.[13] These 
optimal properties enabled LDH to become one of the most 
promising electrode materials for high-performance SCs In this study, we propose a novel electrodeposition process 
followed by in situ oxidation to prepare oxygen-vacancy abundant NiMn-LDH (named Ov-LDH) with high specific capacity 
up to 1183 C g−1
 at 1 A g−1 and high rate capability (835 C g−1
at even 10 A g−1
) for the first time. Under electrodeposition, 
NiMn-LDH was successfully synthesized with standard layered 
structure on the surface of nickel foam. Meanwhile, the amount 
of oxygen vacancies can be precisely controlled by adjusting the 
oxidation time afterwards. The whole synthesis process can 
be completed in minutes and can be extended to any conductive substrate such as nickel foil, copper foil, and carbon fiber 
paper, indicating its wide application potential. Furthermore, 
an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) with optimized Ov-LDH 
as positive electrode and commercial activated carbon (AC) as 
negative electrode achieved an energy density of 46.7 Wh kg−1
at a power density of 1.7 kW kg−1. Our work reported here not 
only established a new route to prepare oxygen-vacancy abundant LDH materials, but also sheds light on the effective design 
of electrodes to improve electrochemical performance of energy

21_int.txt,"Renewable and eco-friendly energy sources, such as solar, wind and geothermal energy 
represent promising and sustainable solutions to the increasing global energy needs and fossil 
fuels depletion.1
 However, due to the intermittent nature of most renewable energy sources, 
the development of efficient electrical energy storage devices is critical yet challenging.1
 The 
soaring demand on portable electronics and hybrid electric vehicles calls for power sources 
with high power density, outstanding energy density as well as excellent durability.2
 Among 
various rechargeable energy storage devices, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have attracted much 
attention due to its outstanding energy density.3
 Enormous amount of lithium ions can be 
stored in the bulk electrode materials via ion intercalation (Faradaic reactions), which 
contributes to excellent energy density of more than 100 Wh kg-1 (Fig. 1).1,4 Yet, the sluggish 
lithium ion diffusion in bulk materials restricts its power density (typically < 1 kW kg-1) and 
makes it difficult to satisfy the need of electronics such as memory back-up systems that 
require pulse-power supply.1,2

Electrochemical capacitors, also called supercapacitors (SCs), have gained a lot of 
attention for the high-power uptake and supply applications owing to their fast 
charging/discharging (usually in a few seconds) characteristics.1,5-7 As shown in the Ragone 
plot (Fig. 1), electrochemical capacitors can deliver a high specific power density of more 
than 10 kW kg-1, about one order of magnitude larger than that of LIBs. Based on the 
different charge storage mechanisms, SCs can be categorized into electric double-layer 
capacitors (EDLCs) and pseudocapacitors. Charge storage of EDLCs relies on the interfacial 
electrostatic charge adsorption between electrode (e.g., carbon-based materials) and 
electrolyte (Helmholtz double-layer, Fig. 2a), whereas the pseudocapacitors primarily depend 
on the fast and reversible surface (or near surface) faradaic reactions of electrodes (e.g., 
transition metal oxides, Fig. 2b).1,8 The energy (E), the maximum power (Pmax) and average 
power (P) of a supercapacitor are calculated according to the following equations:2,5 
where V is the device voltage, C is the overall capacitance of the device, R is the equivalent 
series resistance (ESR),  is the discharging time Carbon is an earth abundant element that has outstanding physical and chemical 
properties favorable for supercapacitor electrodes, such as excellent electrical conductivity, 
nontoxicity and superior electrochemical stability, etc.
2,9-11 Therefore, carbons have been the 
most commonly used electrode materials for EDLCs. For EDLCs, charges are stored via 
surface charge accumulation and the electric double-layer capacitance is calculated by the 
following equation: 
where A is the surface area of the electrode,  is the electrolyte dielectric constant and d 
represents the thickness of the charge double-layer. According to the equation, it is clear that 
electric double-layer capacitance is directly proportional to the specific surface area.9
 In this 
regard, the overall charge storage capability of carbon materials is determined and limited by their ion accessible surface area. For example, theoretical specific electric double-layer 
capacitance of graphene is only around 550 F g-1, which is difficult to satisfy the increasing 
demand on the energy density of charge storage devices.13
 
Transition metal oxides are another important category of supercapacitor electrode 
materials. They can store charges through faradaic reactions, so most of them have 
remarkable theoretical specific capacitances that are substantially higher than the 
capacitances of carbon materials.14-16 However, most transition metal oxides have poor 
electrical conductivities, which is detrimental to their rate capabilities and limits their 
capacitances during fast charging and discharging.17 For example, TiO2 has a fairly low 
electrical conductivity of about 10-7 S cm-1, which results in more than 80% capacitance 
decay when the scan rate increased from 10 to 1000 mV s-1
.
18,19 Another example is MoO3
that has a low conductivity of about 0.06 S cm-1, causing almost 70% capacitance lost when 
the current density increased from 0.5 A g-1 to 10 A g-1
.
20 Besides, sluggish ion diffusion also 
poses a barrier to power density (capability of fast charging and discharging) of both carbon 
and transition metal oxide based supercapacitors.17
 
To improve the capacitive performance of carbon and metal oxide based materials, a 
variety of chemical methods have been implemented to activate these SC electrodes. For 
example, methods of introducing heteroatom doping and increasing porosity have been used 
to boost the pseudocapacitance and rate capability of carbon-based electrode materials.21-56
Controlled introduction of oxygen vacancies and elemental doping have been developed to 
improve the electrical conductivity of transition metal oxides.19,20,57-70 Exfoliation methods 
have been explored to increase number of active sites and facilitate the ion diffusion for both layered carbon structures and metal oxide materials.

structures.1,2,9.12,17,79 This recent review article also presented an excellent summary of 
different porous carbon electrodes with corresponding synthesis techniques with particular 
emphasis on the creation of macro-pores and their function in facilitating ion diffusion.80
Although increasing porosity of carbon electrodes is one of the activation strategies we are 
highlighting in this review article, we also present other important chemical activation 
techniques such as chemical exfoliation and elemental doping for improving capacitive 
performances of carbon materials as well as metal oxides. The challenges and opportunities in

modern electronics stimulates the advance of cost-effective and 
safe energy storage devices. Featuring higher voltage window, 
hybrid supercapacitors deliver higher energy density than 
the conventional electrochemical double-layer capacitors and superior power performance compared to 
the Li-ion batteries, holding great promise 
for next-generation energy storage 
devices.[1–3]
 Low-cost and natural abundant 
transition metal oxides (TMOs), typically 
those based on Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni, 
have been intensively studied as batterytype electrode material due to the multiple 
oxidation states that are available for the 
reversible redox reactions.[4]
 Nevertheless, 
poor electrical conductivity and sluggish 
reaction kinetics are the main bottlenecks 
that constrain the energy storage capacity 
of TMOs. Over the past decades, nanostructured materials with desirable surface 
areas and morphologies,[5,6]
 and hybrid 
with carbonaceous materials,[7]
 have been 
synthesized and shown visible effectiveness in addressing these bottlenecks. 
However, the performance optimization 
via simply increasing the exposed surface 
area and shortening the electron/ion diffusion paths is still quite limited due to low 
surface reactivity with insufficient electroactive sites of pristine TMOs. The finetuning of the material to realize surface high reactivity with fast 
charge storage is of great significance for battery-type materials 
to fully release their charge storage capacity.
Recently, vacancy engineering, especially in the case of surface oxygen vacancies, has proven to be an effective approach 
to optimize the electronic structure, improve the number of 
active sites, and boost the electrochemical and catalytic performance.[8–10]
 Methods like hydrogenation, chemical reduction, 
and plasma engraving were frequently reported to modulate 
oxygen vacancies of TMOs and therefore boost the capacitive 
performance.[11–17]
 Unfortunately, the main barriers of these 
strategies are the high-energy consumption and lack of controllability of introduced oxygen vacancies. In extreme cases, 
excessive vacancies might cause the excessive reduction of the 
transition metal active sites into the elementary substance or 
the collapse of metal oxide skeleton, which will sacrifice the 
capacity and cyclability of materials. Therefore, a controllable 
and efficient vacancy engineering strategy is urgently needed 
for further breakthroughs in promoting the capacitive performance of TMOs, but it is still a big challenge.
Among these TMOs materials, Co3O4 has been regarded 
as one of the most promising candidates because of its low cost and high theoretical capacity (higher than 500 mAh g−1
calculated by two-electron reaction).[16]
 However, the most 
reported capacity of Co3O4-based electrode materials is still far 
lower than its theoretical value owning to the restricted surface 
chemical reactivity and high internal resistance.[18–21]
 Herein, 
we demonstrate, an electrochemical lithiation treatment can act 
as an effective vacancies engineering strategy on Co3O4 nanoneedles, which leads to remarkable enhancement of electrochemical performance of the material. The lithiation of Co3O4
crystal weakens the coordination of the CoO band, resulting 
in abundant oxygen vacancies (octahedral Co2+), which not only 
act as the electroactive sites for the redox reactions but also 
greatly improve the electron-transfer efficiency. The inserted Li 
atom activates neighboring Co atom with lower OH− adsorption energy, allowing high surface reactivity for fast and efficient redox reactions. Benefiting from the merits above, the 
lithiated Co3O4 delivers a high specific capacity of 260 mAh g−1
at 1 A g−1
 with excellent rate performance and cyclability. The 
hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) based on the lithiated Co3O4
and the N-doped activated carbon (NAC) electrodes achieves 
a maximum energy density of 76.7  Wh kg−1
 and exceptional 
power density of 18.7  kW kg−1
 at 46.9  Wh kg−1

performance.

23_int.txt,"Supercapacitors are one of the most efficient classes of electrochemical storage 
devices because of their higher power density, faster charge–discharge rate, and 
longer lifespan than those of lithium-ion batteries [1, 2]. With regard to the charge 
storage mechanism of electrode materials, conventional carbonaceous materials store 
electrical energy through electrostatic accumulation of surface charge [3, 4], whereas 
transition-metal oxides involve fast reversible Faradaic reactions at the surface or at a 
near-surface region, producing higher energy densities [5, 6]. However, the high 
energy density of transition-metal oxides is achieved by sacrificing power density and 
cycling lifetime, impeding their large-scale practical application in supercapacitors [7, 
8]. The demand for supercapacitors with favorable energy and power densities has 
stimulated tremendous research interest on the exploration of novel nanostructured 
electrode materials.Among transition metal oxides, multiple metal oxides have been widely investigated 
as promising alternatives for supercapacitors because of their accessible oxidation 
states, higher reversible capacities, and better electrical conductivity than unitary 
metal oxides [9-11]. Recently, cobalt molybdate (CoMoO4) is attracting ever-growing 
interest for electrochemical energy storage because of its high theoretical capacity, 
natural abundance, and environmental friendliness [12]. However, the electrochemical
properties of CoMoO4-based systems remain unsatisfactory because of their 
intrinsically sluggish reaction kinetics and limited electrochemically active sites,
which must be effectively addressed. 
In tackling these problems, several approaches have been explored. For instance, 
surface modification of transition metal oxides has been considered an effective 
strategy to accelerate and intensify reaction kinetics, realizing high electrochemical
performance. A representative example is the recently reported phosphate 
ion-functionalized Co3O4 nanosheets [13], whose electrochemically active reaction 
sites and surface reactivity were efficiently increased, resulting in an improved charge 
storage capacity. Alternatively, defect engineering by introducing oxygen vacancies or 
heteroatoms is a promising approach to increase the electrochemically active sites and
to improve the reaction kinetics of materials, resulting in enhanced electrochemical 
performances [14, 15]. For instance, Lu et al. reported that the incorporation of O 
vacancies into Fe2O3 exhibited higher electrochemical performance than pure Fe2O3
[16], which is attributed to the O vacancies serving as shallow donors and electrochemically active sites, ultimately leading to the accelerated reaction kinetics at 
the surface. Wang et al. reported that the inclusion of P atoms in Co3O4 improved the
electrocatalytic properties due to the reduced reaction free-energy and the tuned 
electronic structure after the introduction of the P dopant [17]. As a consequence,
simultaneous introduction of P and O vacancies into a lattice structure would be
expected to improve energy-storage performance of CoMoO4, but such phenomenon 
in supercapacitors has been scarcely reported.
Here, we propose a promising strategy to boost the electrochemical performance of 
CoMoO4 nanosheets grown on Ni foam through the introduction of O vacancies and P 
atoms to the parent material. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide 
insight regarding the contribution of O vacancies and P incorporation on the structural 
and electronic properties of P-CoMoO4-x. The novel P-CoMoO4-x exhibits greatly 
improved electrochemical properties compared to the pristine CoMoO4. Moreover, an 
assembled asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) consisting of the optimized P-CoMoO4-x
as positive electrode and activated carbon (AC) as negative electrode shows a high
energy density of 58 W h kg−1
at a power density of 850 W kg−1

performance with 98.7% capacity retention after 10 000 cycles at a high current

24_int.txt,"As advanced energy storage devices, electrochemical 
supercapacitors (SCs) have received considerable interest and are 
expected to be widely applied in the fields of portable electronic 
products and hybrid electric vehicles due to their high-power 
density, fast charge/discharge capability, long cycling life, excellent 
reliability and flexibility [1-3]. Based on their energy storage 
mechanisms, SCs can be divided into electrical double-layer 
capacitors and pseudocapacitors: the former stores energy through 
charge separation using porous carbon (graphene [4], carbon 
nanotubes [5], activated carbon [6], etc.) as the electrode materials, 
while the latter achieves energy storage by a faradaic process using 
redox-active conducting polymers and transition metal oxides or 
hydroxides (NiO [7], MnO2
 [8-10], Co3O4
 [11,12], RuO2
 [13], 
NiCo2O4
 [14,15], Ni(OH)2
 [16,17], Co(OH)2
 [18], etc.) as electrode 
materials. In comparison with electrical double-layer capacitors, 
pseudocapacitors can provide much higher energy densities and thus 
have drawn tremendous attention [19]. 
Among the above transition metal oxide electrode materials for 
pseudocapacitors, MnO2
 has been found to be one of the most 
promising candidates due to its unique properties of high theoretical 
specific capacitance (ca. 1400 F g-1), excellent compatibility with 
neutral electrolytes, natural abundance, low cost, and environmental 
friendliness [20-22]. To date, various micro/nanostructured MnO2
materials, such as nanoneedles, nanorods, nanosheets, and hollow 
nanostructures, have been successfully constructed with support 
materials and extensively researched as SCs electrode materials [23-
25]. It has been demonstrated that the microstructure and 
morphology of MnO2
 play a key role in improving the performance 
of SCs. However, these MnO2
 micro/nanostructures without 
introducing foreign supporting structures could generally be 
pulverized due to the volume change during the charge/discharge 
processes, leading to poor cycling stability [25]. 
On the other hand, the rate capability of the MnO2 electrode material 
is still rather poor, especially when operating at higher rates because 
of its low electrical conductivity (ca. 10-5 to 10-6 S cm-1), and this 
severely restricts its practical application as a high-performance 
electrode material for SCs [26,27]. To overcome this shortcoming, 
many strategies have been devoted to enhancing the overall 
electrochemical performance of MnO2
, including doping other metal 
elements (Co, Ag, Au, Ni, Fe, Cu, Mg and Al) and constructing 
hybrid structures of MnO2
 with well-conductive components [28-
36]. Zhou et al. [37] reported that Al-doped α-MnO2
 exhibits 
enhanced electrical conductivity and delivers an improved specific 
capacitance of ca. 217 F g−1 at a current density of 2.0 A g−1. Moon 
et al. [38] prepared a MnO2
/carbon nanotube core-shell particle 
composite with an increased rate capability and a capacity of 251 F 
g
−1 at a high current density of 10 A g-1, which is 68 % of that at a 
low current density of 0.5 A g-1 (370 F g−1). Although the introduction of additional metal atoms and conductive components 
could improve the electrical conductivity of the MnO2
-based 
electrode, the enhancement of the electrochemical performance of 
this electrode is still limited. 
Based on the abovementioned research progress, it is a great 
challenge and of considerable interest to intrinsically enhance the 
conductivity and structural stability of pure MnO2
micro/nanostructures for high-performance supercapacitors. To 
the best of our knowledge, yolk-shell-structured MnO2
microspheres with distinctive yolk@void@shell configurations 
have not yet been reported. If these microspheres are 
developed, both the MnO2
 yolk and MnO2
 shell can serve as an 
electroactive material to improve the specific capacitance. 
Additionally, the voids between the MnO2
 yolk and MnO2
 shell 
can provide a buffering space to accommodate the volume 
expansion/contraction of the MnO2
 yolk and MnO2
 shell during 
the charge/discharge processes, resulting in an enhanced 
cycling stability. Moreover, it was recently discovered that 
defect engineering (vacancy or facet controlling) can transform 
MnO2
 with low intrinsic electrical conductivity into a halfmetallicity character and further lead to significant 
enhancements in electrochemical performance [39-41]. 
Therefore, in this work, we demonstrate the synthesis of yolkshell-structured MnO2
 microspheres with oxygen vacancies 
(ov-MnO2@MnO2
). The obtained yolk-shell-structured ovMnO2@MnO2
 microspheres are composed of MnO2
nanoparticles with porous and large surface areas. These yolkshell-structured ov-MnO2@MnO2
 microspheres show a large 
specific capacitance (452.4 F g-1 at 1 A g–1), excellent cycling 
stability (92.2 %), and a superior rate capability (~79.2 % and 
69.9 % of the initial capacity at 20 A g–1 and 50 A g–1
, 
respectively). Furthermore, the asymmetric supercapacitor 
(ASC) composed of yolk-shell-structured ov-MnO2@MnO2
microspheres (as the positive electrode) and commercial 
activated carbon (as the negative electrode) shows a superior 
energy density of 40.2 Wh kg-1 and a maximum power density 
of 22.28 kW kg-1.

25_int.txt,"The demand of energy storage device has increased rapidly with the development 
of portable electronic devices, electric vehicles and many highly energy consumption 
application [1-4]. Supercapacitors have attracted much attention due to its more 
excellent performance of high power density and good stability than that of the most 
widely used batteries [5-7]. In particular, supercapacitor can be classified into two types 
according to the energy storage mechanism, which are electrical double-layer 
capacitors and faradic capacitors [8-10]. Presently, more and more efforts were focused 
on developing faradic capacitors because of their much higher specific capacitance and 
energy density than those of electrical double-layer capacitors. Generally, the faradaic 
electrode materials, including transition metal oxide/hydroxides [11-14] and conductive 
polymers [15-17], are capable of rich redox reactions for the charge storage due to their 
multiple oxidation states. 
Among various metal oxides, NiCo2O4, as a kind of mixed metal oxides, have 
attracted much attention because of their better electrical conductivity and higher 
electrochemical activity compared with the monometallic nickel or cobalt oxides [18-
20]. Nevertheless, this spinel metal oxide still suffers from low capacitance and poor  rate performance due to their high dependence on surface faradaic redox reactions and 
ion diffusion [21-23]. To solve this problem, the employment of hollow metal oxide 
architecture is one of the effective technical strategies. In particular, the hollow 
architectures, such as core–shell, yolk–shell, and multi-shell structures, not only 
provide more electrochemical sites to increase the capacitance, but also significantly 
reduce ion diffusion pathway to improve the rate performance [24-28]. Meanwhile, the 
space between shell and void in hollow configurations is able to buffer the residual 
stress of volume expansion/contraction during the repeated faradaic reactions, thus 
improving the cycle life of electrodes [29, 30]. Except for improving the rate capability, 
a yolk–shelled structure is responsible to enhance the energy density of the electrode 
materials by enlarging the weight fraction of the core [31]. However, most of previously 
reported yolk-shell structures possess a smooth surface, which usually results in a low 
exposed active surface [27]. It is believed that the yolk-shell structure with external 
nanostructured surface as the shell is also beneficial to further improve the 
electrochemical properties of supercapacitors due to its highly exposed electrochemical 
active sites. 
Inspired by above considerations, we report a controllable self-template approach 
to prepare yolk-shelled NiCo2O4 spheres (YS-NiCo2O4). The as-prepared yolk-shell 
structure constructs from nanosheets as the outside shell and a sphere as the internal 
core. The unique structure can provide more highly exposed surface area (169.6 m2

shows a capacitance up to 835.7 F g−1
at 0.5 A g−1
and expected cycling stability of 93 % retention after 10000 cycles. Moreover, a hybrid supercapacitor combined with YSNiCo2O4 and graphene shows a high energy density and good cycle stability. The 
desirable performance of yolk-shelled NiCo2O4 suggests it to be a promising material 
as supercapacitor electrodes.

10 respectively. However, the cycling stability and rate performance of
NiO–SCs still cannot meet the requirements of practical applications because NiO itself has intrinsic high resistivity (1013 U
cm) and volume structural expansion and contraction during
charging/discharging processes.11 Also, CuO–SCs only present
specic capacitances far below their theoretical predictions,
mainly resulting from the poor electrical conductivity.3,12,13
Therefore, single-phase oxides cannot satisfy the commercial
standard, and then hybrid nanostructured systems such as
metal oxide/carbon materials, metal oxide/conducting polymer
composites and AB2O4-type bimetallic oxides are preferred as
alternatives, as they can synergistically enhance the intrinsic
properties of each component such as electrical/ionic conductivity, electrochemical reactivity, and cycling stability.14–18
Recently, several strategies have emerged for constructing
novel hybrid nanostructured systems composed of two kinds of
transition metal oxide, in which two good pseudocapacitive
metal oxides are integrated into one three-dimensional (3D) architecture that directly grows on the current collector with
a binder-free advantage. A typical strategy is based on a two-step
procedure using ordered nanostructure arrays serving as the
initially formed template, for instance, CoO nanowires were pregrown on a nickel (Ni) foam, and then reacted with a Ni(NO3)2
aqueous solution, and a hybrid nanostructure of porous CoO
nanowires@nickel hydroxidenitrate nanoakes was nally obtained, which showed an enhanced electrochemical performance in both the capacitance and cycling stability.19 Moreover,
this strategy has been developed to fabricate synergetic core–
shell nanostructures. The rst example is a hybrid array consisting of Co3O4 porous nanowires deposited with MnO2 ultrathin shells by an interfacial carbon-assisted reaction under
hydrothermal conditions.20 More recently, Liu et al.21 prepared
NiO@MnO2 core–shell nanowires on a Ni foam. Chen et al.22
prepared CuO@MnO2 core–shell nanostructures on a copper
grid using quick wet etching and subsequent hydrothermal
deposition methods. In both cases, the hybrid nanostructures
displayed improved cycling stability and enhanced specic
capacitance as well as areal capacitance compared to individual
NiO or CuO.
Despite this progress, in fact, the specic capacity for transition metal oxide-based electrodes is still much below the
theoretical limit with moderate power density; most of the
synthetic routes or material preparation procedures are
complicated and difficult to scale up; the internal electrochemical mechanisms of emerging metal oxide-based hybrid
arrays/nanostructures for SCs need to be further understood;
and it is still a challenge to prepare more advanced metal oxidebased architectures and supercapacitors.3,11,21
In the present work, micron-sized hollow particles composed
of mesoporous NiO–CuO nanowires grown on a Ni foam
substrate were prepared using a simple one-pot hydrothermal
synthesis method and subsequent annealing. Both NiO and
CuO are good pseudocapacitive metal oxides and the hybrid
NiO–CuO should have a greater contribution to the electrochemical charge storage. Besides mesoporous nanowires, here
a hollow architecture was designed to provide a fast diffusion
pathway for electrolyte ions and a high surface area with more
active sites as well as an increased electrode/electrolyte contact
area.23–25 Therefore, the as-prepared NiO–CuO@Ni foam delivered a high areal capacitance of 4.35 F cm2 and a specic
capacitance of 1450.8 F g1 at a current density of 2 mA cm2
,
with good rate capability (70.9% retention at 20 mA cm2
).
Further, the NiO–CuO@Ni foam was directly utilized as
a binder-free positive electrode, in combination with a negative
electrode based on a 3D porous graphene hydrogel (PGH) to
construct an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC). It is expected
that the ASC fabricated with pseudocapacitive metal oxides
combined with electric double-layer capacitive (EDLC) carbon
materials can broaden the operating potential window, and
achieve a further enhancement of energy density and cycling
stability.21,26–29 Additionally, it has been reported that the
introduced oxygen (O-) vacancies on Co3O4, MoO3 or the Ovacancies on the surface of NiO nanorods can promote their
electronic conductivity.30–32 Thus, annealing of the hydrothermal product was performed here in order to overcome the
poor electronic conductivity problem of metal oxides. As
a result, the obtained NiO–CuO//PGH ASC not only realizes
a wide potential window of 1.6 V in an aqueous electrolyte, but
also presents a high energy density of 33.8 W h kg1 at a power
density of 400 W kg1
. More specically, the elegant 3D hollow
architecture constructed with mesoporous NiO–CuO nanowires
consisting of alternately linked NiO and CuO nanocrystals can
relax strain stress either in a hollow 3D structure or along a onedimensional (1D)-direction nanowire, which helps to maintain
the structural integrity during charge/discharge processes, and
the as-fabricated NiO–CuO//PGH ASC shows an outstanding
cycling stability of 90.4% capacitance retention aer 5000
charge/discharge cycles. Together, considering the convenient
preparation and low cost, our 3D hollow architecture of mesoporous NiO–CuO nanowires has great potential for highly efficient energy storage devices.

a-MnO2 has also shown promise as a catalyst for the oxygen
reduction reaction (ORR).3,12,13 Historically, materials containing precious metals such as platinum, palladium and gold have
been the most successful catalysts for the ORR. However, the
high cost and limited availability of these materials is prohibitive in important commercial applications. In the search for a
low cost alternative, manganese oxides have drawn particular
attention due to their elemental abundance, high activity in
alkaline media and non-toxicity.14–19 While there are many
polymorphs of MnO2, a-MnO2 in particular has demonstrated
high catalytic activity with respect to other polymorphs20–22
beyond the effects of high surface area.12
The Li–O2 battery is an alternative to Li-ion batteries that is
the subject of intense interest due to its high theoretical energy
density.1,3,23–27 However, experimental studies have shown that present implementations of the Li–O2 system may suffer from
poor electrical efficiency, in particular due to overpotentials,
and power density limitations.26,28 To address these issues the
use of transition metal oxide catalysts has been suggested,29,30
and nanorod a-MnO2 demonstrated effective catalytic activity
for this purpose.3,31–36 However, recently the detection of electrolyte decomposisition8,12,37,38 in Li–O2 cells has highlighted the
need to explore the performance of catalysts in stable electrolyte
conditions. With recent demonstrations of good electrolyte
stability during cycling of redesigned Li–O2 cells27,39,40 it is likely
that the utility of catalysts will be important to future studies.
In other work, a-MnO2 has exhibited good catalytic activity in
applications beyond Li–O2 cells, including the reduction of
NOx,
41 microbial fuel cells,42 oxidation of chlorobenzene,43
phenol degradation,44,45 toluene oxidation46,47 as well as oxidation of CO and benzene.48
Fig. 1 shows the unit cell of a-MnO2 where the approximate
MnO6 octahedra are indicated by polyhedra. In-plane there are
both corner and edge sharing octahedra forming a 2  2 tunnel
structure along the c-axis. Along the c-axis all of the octahedra
are edge sharing forming a densely packed wall to the tunnel.
The 2  2 tunnel structure has been described as “open”
compared to the comparatively denser rutile (b) polymorph of
MnO2 and this has been implicated in its excellent catalytic
performance.21 The rationalisation is based upon the reduced
structural disortion and bond-breaking that is required in
important catalytic processes such as oxygen defect formation
and adsorption. The large 2  2 tunnels also provide insertion
channels for adsorbed ions such as Li-ions when a-MnO2 is
used as a battery intercalation cathode.49 Indeed, a previous
modelling study of a-MnO2 by Trahey et al.50 has treated the
thermodynamics of Li-ion and Li-oxide insertion at the surface
of a-MnO2. Based upon the obtained insertion potentials they
suggested that Li-oxide insertion and extraction may be an
active mechanism in the performance of a-MnO2 as a catalyst in
the Li–O2 battery system.
A recent DFT study by Ling and Mizuno51 has considered Liion and Li-oxide insertion into bulk a-MnO2. That work
considered structural distortions upon lithiation and the thermodynamics of insertion. They also considered the effect of
Li2O insertion upon the electronic structure. Li and Na insertion into bulk a-MnO2 has been considered by some of the
present authors using DFT.52 Cockayne and Li53 have studied
the magnetic structure and the adsorption of dopants for bulk
a-MnO2 and Crespo et al. also treated the magnetic structure
using DFT.54 Liu et al. recently considered the surface energy
and magnetic order of the (110) surface of a-MnO2 by similar
methods.55 Cheng et al. used DFT to consider adsorption of
oxides at rutile MnO2 surfaces.56 They found that oxygen
vacancies enhance the interaction between oxide species and
the MnO2 surface. Furthermore, the presence of oxygen vacancies reduced the enthalpy of the oxygen reduction process at
MnO2 surfaces by more than 2 eV. A recent rst-principles study
of manganese oxides catalysts for the ORR and oxygen evolution
reaction (OER) constructed Pourbaix diagrams of stable surface
congurations of MnOx stoichiometries as a function of applied
potential and pH.57 That work found that the oxygen adsorbed
(110) surface of rutile MnO2 was active at experimental conditions for the OER. However, as highlighted by the authors they
did not consider the presence of a-MnO2, nor the energetics of
oxygen vacancy formation.
Due to the renewed interest in a-MnO2, in this work we
perform a comprehensive ab initio study of its surface properties. The study of a-MnO2 surfaces in the present work shows a
tendency for this material to form rod-like morphologies that
are elongated along the c-axis, which is likely to be important to
the formation of nanostructures with improved capacitance.
First we outline our computational methods. Then we present
results on the structures and energies of stoichiometric
surfaces, as well as the equilibrium crystal morphology.
Following this the calculated energetics of oxygen vacancy
formation at surfaces are discussed with reference to catalytic
activity.

the most active electrocatalysts. However, the high cost of the outstanding electrocatalyst 
slowed down the commercial application13-16. Therefore, exploring the excellent 
performance, low-cost functional materials and overcoming the slow kinetics are the 
strong desires.
In recently research, MCo2O4(M=Co 、 Ni 、 Zn 、 Mn) with spinel structure as the 
electrode materials and electrocatalyst have been reported17-20. Among various spinel 
oxides, NiCo2O4 shows high theoretical specific capacitance, electrochemical stability 
and great catalytic activity 
in alkaline electrolytes. However, the NiCo2O4 was restricted by its poor electronic 
conductivity and insufficient active sites, which are the main barriers21-22. Therefore, necessary to improve the electrochemical activity of NiCo2O4 and various strategies have 
been developed. For example, introduction of carbon materials or metal ion doping (e.g. 
NiCo2O4@graphene quantum dots23, NiCo2O4@CNT24, Zn-Ni-Al-Co oxide25, Fe-doped 
mesoporous Co3O4
26). However, the above strategies did not significantly improve the 
electrochemical performance. Recently, anion doping in transition metal oxides (TMO) 
(S-NiFe2O4

28, N-NiMoO4
29) to prepare highly conductive 
electrode material has gained world attentions. Herein, our work will to explore the anion 
doped NiCo2O4 for energy storage and electrocatalyst applications.
In this work, we synthesized phosphorus-doped NiCo2O4 nanowires with excellent 
electrochemical performance, through a facile hydrothermal treatment and annealing 
under N2 atmosphere at 300 oC. NiCo2O4 nanowires were grown on the conductive 
substrate nickel foam (NF), and then treated by phosphating. Benefiting from PH3 plasma 
(2NaH2PO2(s)=PH3(g)+ Na2HPO4(s))30, the phosphate element will be introduced into 
NiCo2O4 nanowires. Due to the much smaller electronegativity of P element than that of 
O element, the material produces many oxygen vacancies. The P-NCO NWs material exhibit higher electrical conductivity and smaller band gap. Moreover, the longer Ni-Co-P 
bond, comparing to that of the Ni-Co-O bond, poses weaker attraction to electrons in 3d 
orbitals31. Therefore, P-NCO nanowires displayed an excellent electrochemical activity 
and fast redox reaction32. As confirmed in the experimental results, P-NCO NWs /NF have 
great specific capacitance (2747.8 F g-1 at 1 A g-1), high rate performance (50 % at 100 
A g-1) and after 5000 cycles at 15 A g-1, the capacitance still retained 94.6 %. Besides, as 
the catalyst for OER and HER, P-NCO NWs/NF also displayed good electrochemical 
performance, with lower overpotential (300 mV and 55 mV at 10 mA cm-2)"
29_int.txt,"The rapid development of the global economic and the sustained growth of the world’s population have accelerated the 
consumption of fossil energy, causing increasingly serious 
energy and environmental crisis. To avoid further deterioration, people have been actively seeking not only renewable 
energy sources but also developing a variety of reliable energy 
storage systems. Supercapacitors (SCs), also known as electrochemical SCs, have drawn considerable research attention and considered as indispensable energy 
storage devices because of their higher 
power density and greater life expectancy 
compared with their competitive counterparts such as batteries, fuel cells, and conventional capacitors. Significantly, owing 
to their distinct advantages including 
the simple and safe configuration, quick 
charge/discharge response, large power 
output, and long operating life (>100 000 
cycles), SCs show a promising prospect 
in next-generation energy technologies, 
like smart and wearable electronics, quick 
charging cellphones, regenerative braking 
electric motors, and instant management 
of industrial power and energy.[20–24]
Currently, there are three main categories of active materials employed 
to advance the electrochemical performance of SCs: i) carbonaceous matrix, 
ii) conducting polymers, and iii) metal 
oxides (MOs). With respect to the former 
two types, MOs, especially transition MOs, usually delivers 
a much higher specific capacitance, as their unique crystal 
structure, combined with the multiple oxidation states of 
metal ions, are both in favor of excellent charge storage capability. Sometimes, SCs assembled with MOs are also called 
pseudocapacitors (PCs), because different from carbon-based 
electrical double layer capacitors (EDLCs), they realize the 
charge storage via fast Faradaic redox and/or metal ion intercalation reactions. In this way, they could deliver substantially superior specific capacitances as high as 300–1200 F g−1
and offer 10–100 times larger energy density than that of 
EDLCs.[25–29]
 In recent years, various MO materials have been 
proposed as high-performance SCs electrodes, some of which 
the theoretical capacitances and common operating potential 
windows are summarized in Figure 1a,b.[1–19]
Nevertheless, further practical applications of these SCs 
are severely hindered by the poor electrical conductivity and 
frustrating structural stability of semiconductive MOs. To 
address these issues, owing to the rapid advancement of nanotechnology, a series of nano- and meso-scale morphological 
engineering strategies have been proposed to boost the electrochemical performance of MOs, either by enlarging the 
electrochemical active surface area or by shortening the diffusion length of electrons/ions.[30–32]
 For instance, combining 
MOs with some other highly conductive substances such as 
carbonaceous materials and metals is validated to be a feasible  method to achieve this goal.[33]
 Yet, the pristine MOs still suffer 
from some other intrinsic limitations that cannot be solved 
by these extrinsic modification approaches. Taking MnO2 as 
an example, its theoretical capacitance is expected to reach 
a favorable value of 1380 F g−1, taking advantages of its fast 
and highly reversible redox reactions.[28,34,35]
 However, due 
to its highly resistive nature (10−5 to 10−6 S cm−1), the most 
developed pristine MnO2 merely delivers a practical capacitance about 200–600 F g−1, even at a substantially low mass 
loading.[19,36,37]
 Such unsatisfactory capacitance should be 
assigned to the sluggish electron/ion transportation in materials or at the electrode/electrolyte interface.[19,38]
 Besides, a 
significant portion of energy would be inevitably lost due to 
their large internal resistance, and the resultant SCs thus usually show poor rate capability. From this point of view, the 
full potential of MO-based electrodes still needs to be further 
exploited for the sake of building advanced SCs with high 
capacitance, adorable rate capability, and preferable energy 
storage efficiency.
Recently, creating intrinsic oxygen defects (low valence metal 
centers) has been proposed as a novel strategy to modify the 
electronic properties of most MOs like TiO2,
[39,40]
 MnO2,
[41]
Fe2O3,
[42–46]
 and Bi2O3.
[13]
 These oxygen defects can effectively 
alter the donor densities of MOs, induce impurity states in its 
bandgap, accelerate the kinetics of the surface redox reactions, 
and consequently increase its capacitance.[47,48]
 This concept 
was originally implemented on TiO2 nanotube arrays (NTAs), 
by exposing the sample to thermal treatment under hydrogen 
atmosphere.[39,49]
 Under certain experimental conditions, Ti4+
ions in TiO2 NTAs were only partially reduced to Ti3+ ions, 
and therefore created some oxygen vacancies whose energy 
levels were located at around 0.75–1.18 eV below its conduction 
band.[47,50,51]
 Interestingly, the Ti3+-doped TiO2 NTAs electrodes 
presented substantially better electrochemical performance and 
higher capacitance compared with the untreated sample, which 
was conjointly contributed by the improved donor density and 
the increased density of surface hydroxyl groups. In view of 
the great achievements of oxygen-defective TiO2 in SCs, using 
oxygen vacancies to boost the supercapacitive performance has 
been successfully extended to other frequently used MO electrodes of SCs, such as MnO2−x,
[41,52–54]
 Fe2O3,
[55]
 MoO3−x,
[56,57]
WO3−x,
[57,58]
 and NiO.[59]
 So far, a number of methods have 
been developed to introduce oxygen vacancies in MOs in an 
environmentally friendly, cost-effective, scalable, and controllable manner (Figure 2).[60–63]
SC assembled with oxygen-defective MO electrodes holds 
great promises as next-generation energy storage systems for 
renewable energy collection/utilization, and for the thriving 
market of the hybrid electric vehicles and portable electronic 
devices (mobile phones, touch pads, and wearable gadgets). 
This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of 
recent accomplishments in developing high-performance 
oxygen-defective MOs for SCs assembly. Some commonly used 
methods for oxygen vacancy production are summarized and 
compared. We also highlight different roles of oxygen vacancies 
on the supercapacitive performance of MOs and the relevant 
impact factors. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future 
opportunities of oxygen-defective MO as high-energy and highpower electrode for SCs"
30_int.txt,"Electrochemical energy storage and conversion devices, including lithium-ion 
batteries (LIBs) and supercapacitors, 
play important roles in modern society 
by creating a more convenient and sustainable life for our future. For example, 
LIBs are arguably the most reliable and 
heavily used power sources for personal 
electronics, such as smart phones, digital cameras, and laptops. More recently, 
LIBs and supercapacitors have also been 
widely considered as power systems for 
electric vehicles. They have also attracted 
significant attentions in large-scale energy 
storage options for renewable energies, 
such as wind and solar power, as well as 
grid energy storage.
Energy density, power density, cycling 
stability, and cost are four crucial concerns 
in the development and exploitation of 
electrochemical energy storage devices. 
LIBs, which are dependent on intercalation, conversion, or alloying reactions over their electrodes for 
energy storage, usually exhibit favorable energy densities; however, the associated power densities and cycling stabilities are 
sometimes insufficient for many applications. Supercapacitors, 
which store energy via charge adsorption over the electrode 
(carbon) surface or through Faradaic redox reactions over the 
electrode (typically an oxide or polymer) surface or subsurface, 
have attracted worldwide attentions because of their higher 
power density than traditional capacitors and substantially 
longer cycle life (>100 000 cycles) when compared to LIBs. Significant efforts have been directed toward the improvement of 
energy density of supercapacitors.[1–3] By optimizing the electrode microstructure and surface area, a maximum capacitance 
of 150–300 F g−1
 can be achieved using a carbon-based electrode 
based on the electric double-layer capacitors (EDLC) for energy 
storage,[4] while a capacitance more than 10 times higher can 
be obtained with a pseudocapacitive electrode based on surface 
Faradaic redox reactions.[5–7] Recent progress in the development of nanostructured electrodes has seen the gap in energy 
density and power density between LIBs and supercapacitor diminishes significantly. Some intercalation-type nanostructured electrodes for new energy applications have demonstrated impressive capacitive charge storage.[8–10] However, the 
nanostructure may lead to a low pack density of the electrode, 
leading to poor volumetric energy density of the corresponding 
supercapacitor. Importantly, in many portable electronics applications, the volumetric energy density is a more important 
characteristic than the gravimetric energy density. It is still a 
considerable challenge to develop energy materials with high 
power densities, high volumetric energy densities, and good 
cycling stability at low cost.
Recently, a new type of supercapacitor has emerged that 
utilizes the cations (e.g., Li+) for charge storage with a view to 
enhancing energy density while maintaining the high power 
density of conventional supercapacitors.[9–12] For example, 
orthorhombic Nb2O5 nanocrystals were shown to exhibit an 
intercalation pseudocapacitive phenomenon, whereby the 
Nb2O5 crystalline network provided an abundance of 2D transport channels for Li+ intercalation/deintercalation with minimal destructive structural changes.[9] Tolbert and co-workers 
found that mesoporous crystalline MoO3 had an intercalation 
pseudocapacitance comparable to traditional redox pseudocapacitors due to its unique nanoscale architecture.[12] Hence, 
intercalation supercapacitance provides a new approach for the 
development of electrochemical energy storage devices with 
both desirable energy density and power density.
It is a widely held belief that oxygen anion diffusion in the 
oxides at room temperature is difficult due to the relatively 
large size of anion. Intriguingly, Kudo et al.[13] demonstrated 
in 1973 that reversible electrochemical intercalation of oxygen 
into defective Nd1-xSrxCoO3-δ perovskite oxide was possible 
in a KOH solution at room temperature. The calculated diffusion constant was as high as 1.4 × 10−11 cm2 s−1
. More 
recently, the oxygen anion intercalation capability of LaMnO3
lattices has been exploited by Johnston and co-workers for 
energy storage, reaching a capacitance of ≈600 F g−1 for a 
reduced LaMnO3 perovskite oxide at room temperature, as 
calculated on the basis of the cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests.[14]
Subsequently, we demonstrated that a Nb-doped SrCoO3-δ
perovskite with a high oxygen vacancy concentration behaved 
as a promising pseudocapacitors electrode with a gravimetric 
capacitance of 773.6 F g−1
. Its volumetric capacitance reached 
≈2034.6 F cm−3
 with exceptional cycling stability after several 
thousand cycles.[15] Nevertheless, major concerns regarding 
the high price of cobalt and the easy leaching of cobalt into the 
aqueous systems that surround the use of cobaltite-based perovskites render their widespread adoption undesirable. Clearly, 
new cobalt-free materials that possess high oxygen vacancy concentrations and oxygen anion diffusion rates are crucial for the 
widespread realization of this developing technology.
Since volumetric energy density is highly dependent on the 
packing density of the electrode material, it is preferable to prepare pore-free electrode materials with a high tap density. To 
maximize the intercalation pseudocapacitance, the amount of 
accessible oxygen defect sites and the diffusion rate of oxygen 
anions inside the oxide lattice should also be maximized. Several reports indicated that some layered double perovskite 
oxides possessed fast oxygen ion diffusion channels, in which 
the oxygen diffusion exhibited a very low activation energy.[16,17]
In fact, the oxygen-ion conductivities of some double perovskites are even higher than those of many benchmark single 
perovskite oxides.[18,19] Furthermore, many double perovskite 
oxides also present high concentrations of variable oxygen 
vacancies. These favorable properties suggest that such materials may be developed into electrodes materials for oxygen 
anion-intercalation-type supercapacitors.
In this study, we provide the very first report of the use of 
reduced PrBaMn2O6-δ (r-PBM) with a layered double perovskite 
structure as an excellent oxygen anion-intercalation-type electrode material in supercapacitors. A maximum gravimetric 
capacitance of 1034.8 F g−1
 (>1000 F g−1
) was attained in a liquid 
electrolyte of a 6 m KOH solution for a coarse-type r-PBM with 
a low specific surface area of only 7.83 m2 g−1. The pore-free 
nature of r-PBM also resulted in an ultrahigh volumetric capacitance of 2535.3 F cm−3
, which is the highest reported value. The 
formation of the layered double perovskite structure facilitated 
by hydrogen treatment was found to significantly increase both 
the oxygen vacancy concentration and oxygen anion diffusion 
rate, thus contributing to the outstanding capacitance. Notably, 
Mn leaching in alkaline solution was minimal compared with 
the leaching of cobalt in a PrBaCo2O6-δ (PBC) double perovskite. 
Cumulatively, these outstanding features make r-PBM a highly 
promising electrode material for oxygen anion-intercalationtype supercapacitor."
31_int.txt,"The fast development of portable electronics and electric vehicles has stimulated studies focused on supercapacitors with
high power density, fast recharge capability and long cycling
life.1–4 Among various pseudocapacitor materials, manganese
oxide has attracted a lot of interest because of its high theoretical capacitance, environmental compatibility and abundant
reserves. For example, Yan et al. obtained quantum-sized
Mn3O4 nanoparticles and uniformly dispersed on nitrogendoped graphene, which delivers high energy densities when
using ionic liquids as electrolytes.5 In Conway's theory, the
amount of charge storage during redox reaction is relative to the
redox reactions on the surface or near-surface of electrodes.6,7
Therefore, numerous studies focused on nanoscale electrode
materials with not only larger surface area but also enhanced
specic capacitance.8–10 However, due to the electrostatic
attraction of nanoparticles, they easily aggregate together and
decrease the contact surface of electrolyte and prolong the
electron diffusion path in bulk electrodes.6,11 Moreover,
a porous structure is very important for the diffusion of electrons and ions from the outside to the inside of materials for
fast redox reactions. Meanwhile, the preparation process of
nanoparticle-based electrodes contains the slurry-cast process,
which may also limit the surface area and surface-redox
sites.12,13 Therefore, designing the architecture of the electrodes plays an important role in overcoming the above
mentioned problems.
Fortunately, multishelled hollow sphere materials afford the
most commonly used approach to solve the problems.14
Compared with nanoparticles, the reduction of surface area
caused by aggregation is less because the inner part of multishelled hollow spheres still contributes to redox reactions.11
Moreover, the porous structure on the surface of every shell can
accelerate the electrolyte movement to reach the inner part of
the multishelled materials to achieve sufficient contact.15,16 And
although the outer shell is buried by the slurry-cast process, the
whole inner surface area is still maintained. Therefore, multishelled hollow materials exhibit enlarged surface area to
provide more active sites for reversible redox reactions.17 For
example, Lou et al. used amorphous coordination polymers as
precursors to synthesize complex mixed metal oxide  which exhibit application prospects in energy storage materials.18,19 Wang et al. developed a sequential templating method
to obtain multishelled Co–Mn oxide hollow spheres with the
shell numbers up to septuple shells, which show reversible
capacity and excellent cycling lifetime.20 However, to take full
advantage of multishelled structures, the synthetic method
must be designed to precisely control the shell structure of
multishelled materials, such as the thickness, number and
spatial arrangement of shells.21,22 Moreover, the performance of
solely manganese oxide materials still hinders the future practical application, and the most intractable obstacles are inferior
physical and chemical properties, including low conductivity,
inferior structural stability and slow reaction kinetics.23
To cope with these intrinsic limitations, the most promising
strategy is to design multishelled manganese oxide encapsulated within a carbon layer. In this conguration, the carbon
shell not only acts as the protective and buffering layer to
improve the structural stability of manganese oxide and prevent
the aggregation of multishelled particles, but also tunes the
electronic properties of the oxide to accelerate the electron and
ion transfer kinetics in bulk electrodes.24,25 Among various
carbon materials, 2D graphene with high conductivity, large
surface area, and robust structural stability is a promising
candidate as a carbon layer.26 However, the resulting manganese oxide was, only in a rough manner, sandwiched between
graphene layers and formed a hybrid or mixture with graphene.27 Moreover, as previously reported, the effective charge
transfer between an oxide and graphene and enhanced redox
activity can be achieved via the formation of chemical bridge
bonds between them, and the bridge bonds can also contribute
to the structural stability and redox reactions, which are always
absent in conventional oxide and graphene hybrids.28,29 Thus, in
order to maximize the performance of both components, the
bridge bonds need to be achieved in a controlled manner
through the designed synthetic route. And the synthetic method
for the formation of bridge bonds must be facile for practical
applications.
Here, we designed strongly connected composites consisting
of encapsulated multishelled Mn3O4 hollow spheres in reduced
graphene oxide, denoted as Mn3O4–rGO. The shell structure of
multishelled Mn3O4 hollow spheres is controlled by adjusting
the annealing parameter of the precursors. The C/O functional
groups on the graphene oxide (GO) surface function as the
oxidation sites to promote the strong bonding between multishelled Mn3O4 hollow spheres and graphene. This led to strong
chemical bonds and uniform distribution of multishelled
Mn3O4 encapsulated in graphene. Beneting from the unique
structural characteristics, when used as electrodes for supercapacitors, the Mn3O4–rGO electrode exhibited a high specic
capacitance of 561.5 C g1
, excellent cycle life (98%) and rate
capability. Furthermore, an asymmetric supercapacitor with
Mn3O4–rGO as the cathode and active carbon as the anode
exhibits a high specic capacitance of 180.2 F g1
, with high
energy density (72.3 W h kg1
) and power density (864 W kg1
).
This technology provides a new approach and method for
obtaining high performance supercapacitors."
32_int.txt,"Highly ordered TiO2 nanotube arrays, have attracted much
attention, owing to their high regulation, large surface area,
excellent controllability and stability [1e3]. In recent years, the
focus was made on using TiO2 nanotube arrays as an active material
for potential charge storage device [4e8]. The findings revealed
that unlike carbon materials and other metal oxides [9e11], titania
capacitors exhibited the behavior of conventional electric double
layer capacitors (EDLC) act by a non-faradic mechanism with a very
low specific capacitance. The poor capacitive behavior of TiO2 was
found to be mainly due to its low electrochemical activity and high
resistance, originated from its semiconductor characteristic. Since
the properties of TiO2 are very sensitive to oxygen content in the
lattice [12,13], controlled introduction of oxygen vacancies (Ti3þ
sites) into the TiO2 nanotube arrays has been proved to be an
effective method to improve its electrochemical activity and
conductive behavior of for supercapacitor application [14,15].
However these approaches are always involved in rigorous heat
treatment procedure in hydrogen or argon atmosphere, which is
not cost-effective considering the extra requirement of instruments
and resources.
In this study, a facile cathodic reduction process to introduce
oxygen vacancies into the TiO2 nanotube arrays is investigated and
documented. The cathodic reduction process could be carried out
for several minutes employing an electrochemical instrument,
following the preparation of TiO2 nanotube arrays by electrochemical anodization. Consequently, compared to the heat treatment routes, the cathodic reduction process is expected to have
enhancement on the capacitance along with its user friendly
preparation conditions. When the TiO2 nanotube arrays were
treated with the cathodic reduction process, oxygen vacancies were
formed and hydroxyl groups were introduced on the surface of
TiO2, leading to highly improved electrochemical activity and
conductivity. The reduced TiO2 nanotube arrays (denoted as RTNTs) prepared by the simple cathodic process showed "
33_int.txt,"Recently, supercapacitors that store energy through ion
intercalation into electrode bulk, similar to lithium-ion
batteries, have attracted much attention.[4] Because of the
bulk intercalation mechanism, high surface area is no longer
required to ensure high capacity. To date, most of the
intercalation-type supercapacitor electrodes are based on
positive ion as the charge carrier,[4b,d, 5] while anions are
considered less favorable because of their large ion size.
Recently, Mefford et al. demonstrated that the oxygen ion can
also be effectively used as a charge carrier to realize a new
type of anion-intercalated supercapacitors, and reported
gravimetric capacitance of about 609.8 F g1 for LaMnO3d
perovskite in an aqueous KOH electrolyte.[4e] Cao et al. also
reported the capacitor performance of Sr-doped LaCoO3 and
Sr-doped LaNiO3 perovskites.[6]
Since oxygen vacancies are the charge carriers, increasing
oxygen vacancy concentration may enhance the capacitance
of the oxygen-ion-intercalation electrodes. To realize the
incorporation of oxygen-ion into oxygen vacancies, it requires
the simultaneous oxidation state change of the cations in the
oxide electrodes; thus the oxides should have good redox
capability. Additionally, high oxygen vacancy mobility is
crucial to achieving high power density in order to facilitate
fast oxygen-anion intercalation during charge storage.
Cobalt-based perovskites are superior to Mn-based ones
due to their larger oxygen vacancy concentration and higher
oxygen-ion mobility.[7]
Here we report our findings in synthesis and characterization of SrCo0.9Nb0.1O3d (SCN) perovskite as an outstanding electrode material for supercapacitors in an aqueous
KOH electrolyte at room temperature; SCN is a mixed ionicelectronic conductor that shows superior performance as
a cathode for solid oxide fuel cells and as an oxygenseparation-membrane due to its fast surface oxygen exchange
kinetics, excellent oxygen mobility, and large oxygen vacancy
concentration at elevated temperatures.[8] High tap-density
SCN was synthesized by a facile solid-state reaction. When
tested in a supercapacitor, the anion-intercalated SCN
electrode showed high capacitance, excellent rate capability,
and favorable cycling stability. Furthermore, when coupled
with an AC electrode, the SCN/AC asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) delivered superb energy density, outperforming most of reported ASCs, suggesting that SCN has potential to
be a promising electrode material for next-generation supercapacitors for a wide range of applications.
The Rietveld refinement of SCN XRD pattern (Figure 1 a) revealed a tetragonal structure with lattice parameters of a = 3.8070(0)  and c = 7.776(0)  and a space group
of P4/mmm. After treating in Ar (SCNA) or 10% H2/Ar
(SCNH) atmosphere, SCN still maintained the tetragonal
structure without any second phases (see Figure S1 in the
Supporting Information). A small change in lattice parameters was observed as large amount of oxygen was extracted
from the SCN lattice (Table S1), which is beneficial for
a stable cycling performance as an anion-intercalated electrode for supercapacitor. The amount of oxygen vacancies
were 10.3, 10.6, and 19.4% of oxygen sites in SCN, SCNA and
SCNH, respectively (Table S2), suggesting 9.1% of oxygen in
SCN lattice can be used for energy storage, corresponding to
a capacitance of 546 F g1
. The as-prepared SCN showed
irregular grain shape, large grain size of  1 mm, pore-free
nature, and low Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific
surface area of  8.63 m2 g1 (Figures S2 & S3). The tap
density of the obtained SCN is 2.63 g cm3
, resulting in high
volumetric energy density of the electrode. The O1s XPS
spectrum of SCN, SCNA and SCNH (Figure 1 b, Figure S4 &
Table S3) can be deconvoluted into four characteristic peaks:
lattice oxygen species (O2) at 528.7 eV, highly oxidative
oxygen species (O2
2/O) at 530.0 eV, hydroxy groups (OH)
or surface-adsorbed O2 at 531.0 eV, and surface-adsorbed
H2O at 532.0 eV.[9] The amount of Oads species is intimately
associated with the oxygen vacancy density of perovskite
oxide.[10]
Because of the similar electrochemical performance of the
SCN samples with different amount of oxygen vacancies, here
we present the electrochemical performance of the fresh SCN
(Figure S5). The electrochemical performance of the fresh
SCN electrode was evaluated using cyclic voltammetry (CV)
in KNO3 (Figure S6) and KOH electrolytes, respectively. The
specific capacitance of the SCN electrode increased to
400.2 F g1 at 10 mV s1 in the KOH electrolyte, which was
30-fold higher than that in the KNO3 solution (Figure 2 a). It
suggests the intercalation-type energy storage was likely
appeared with the presence of OH. All the CV curves
exhibited two pairs of redox peaks related to Co2+/Co3+ and
Co3+/Co4+, indicating the capacitance of SCN were mainly
governed by faradic redox reactions. Additionally, the peak
current increased with the scan rate, suggesting electronicand ionic-transport rates were sufficiently rapid.[11] Note that
the background signal due to the Ni foam was negligible
(Figure S7). The Galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD)
curves of the SCN electrode (Figure 2 b) displayed a typical
pseudocapacitance behavior, demonstrating higher gravimetric, areal, and volumetric capacitances (Cm, Ca, and Cv) at
different current densities (Table S4) than those of most stateof-the-art materials (e.g. carbon, RuO2).[12] Such ultrahigh
specific capacitance provided a strong support for the
participation of SCN bulk phase in the energy storage.
Because no phase transition happened during the O2
intercalation or extraction process (Figure S8), the GCD
curves did not show the platform that was typical for a twophase electrode reaction process. Instead, the shapes of the
curves reflect a typical supercapacitor behavior.[4a] The outstanding rate capability (based on the GCD curves), indicated
by a slight decrease (ca. 3.9%) in the capacitance as the
current density was increased from 0.5 to 10 A g1 (Figure 2 c),
implies rapid surface reaction and O2 bulk diffusion, which
was supported by a low charge transfer resistance of the
electrode (0.1111 W) and a high oxygen diffusion rate (1.1 
1012 cm2 s
1
; Figures S9 and S10). The cycling stability is a big
concern because large volume change may occur during the
process that could pulverize the electrode and deteriorate
electrode activity. As shown in Figure 2 d, the initial specific
capacitance was  786.1 F g1
, and progressively increased in
the first 250 cycles, followed by a slow decrease in the
subsequent cycles. Nevertheless,  752.6 F g1 was still
retained after 3,000 cycles, indicating excellent cycling
stability.
Based on above analysis and literatures,[4e, 8a] the charge
storage mechanism of the SCN electrode can be expressed as
shown in Equation (1) and (2).Oxygen vacancies were filled through intercalation of an
electrolyte oxygen ion via OH and diffusion of O2 along the
edges of unit cell; meanwhile, Co2+ was oxidized to Co3+.
Excess O2 was intercalated on the surface by the Co3+
diffusion and oxidation. The surface reaction for the incorporation of O2 from OH into oxygen vacancies was more
complicated in real case, which may involve several steps with
the formation of various intermediate Oads species as supported by the XPS (Figure 1 b). Further understanding of the
charge storage mechanism may be obtained through in situ/
operando synchrotron-enabled X-ray analyses.[13]
In the anion-intercalated supercapacitor, the OH adsorption over the electrode surface (capacitive process) and O2
diffusion within the oxide bulk are involved. The peak current
(i) of CV curve and sweep rate (n) typically obey the powerlaw relationship (i = anb
).[14] As shown in Figure 3 a,  of both cathodic and anodic peaks are close to 1 at region 1
(n < 5 mV s1
), indicating the capacitive process. At region 2
(n > 5 mV s1
), b values are close to 0.5 for both peaks,
suggesting the O2 diffusion is the rate-limiting step.[15] The
relationship between capacity (normalized charge, Q) and v
can also establish the rate-limiting step.[16] In region 1 of
Figure 3 b, the charge was not sensitive to the variation of scan
rate, which means charge storage is not controlled by
diffusion. Moreover, the extrapolated y-intercept yields the
capacitance of 303.0 C g1 at the infinite sweep rate.[4b] In
region 2, the capacity near linearly decreased with increasing
scan rates, implying the O2 diffusion controls the charge
storage. The capacitance associated with the specific surface
area, estimated by extrapolation of the plot in region 2, is only
56.4 C g1
, which is a quite small portion in the entire
capacitance. Therefore, the high capacitance is mainly
contributed from the high rate insertion of O2. For further
confirmation this implication, the capacitance at the infinite sweep rate was also obtained by extrapolating the plot of Q1
vs. n1/2 in region 1 (Figure 3 c). The result is 381.5 C g1
, which
is close to 303.0 C g1
. As shown in Figure 3 d, another feature
of the capacitive behavior at region 1 was the relatively small
peak-potential-shift (< 0.15 V). It is a good indication of the
facile insertion of O2 because the slow diffusion-controlled
process will result in much larger peak shifts such as in
LIBs.[4b]
To demonstrate the feasibility of SCN in practical energy
storage devices, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) was
assembled using SCN and AC as the cathode and anode,
respectively. The stable electrochemical potential window of
the SCN/AC ASC can be extended to 1.5 V (Figure S11). CV
curves of the ASC at various scan rates demonstrated its
excellent capacitive behavior (Figure 4 a). 86.1% of the of both cathodic and anodic peaks are close to 1 at region 1
(n < 5 mV s1
), indicating the capacitive process. At region 2
(n > 5 mV s1
), b values are close to 0.5 for both peaks,
suggesting the O2 diffusion is the rate-limiting step.[15] The
relationship between capacity (normalized charge, Q) and v
can also establish the rate-limiting step.[16] In region 1 of
Figure 3 b, the charge was not sensitive to the variation of scan

peak-potential-shift (< 0.15 V). It is a good indication of the
facile insertion of O2 because the slow diffusion-controlled
process will result in much larger peak shifts such as in

To demonstrate the feasibility of SCN in practical energy
storage devices, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) was
assembled using SCN and AC as the cathode and anode,
respectively. The stable electrochemical potential window of
the SCN/AC ASC can be extended to 1.5 V (Figure S11). CV
curves of the ASC at various scan rates demonstrated its
excellent capacitive behavior (Figure 4 a). 86.1% of the
specific capacitance was retained when the scan rate was
increased from 5 to 50 mV s1
. The specific capacitance
calculated from GCD curves also showed a similar trend
(Figure 4 b). Ragone plots (Figure 4 c) show that an energy
density of 37.6 Wh kg1 was achieved at an average power
density of 433.9 W kg1 for the ASC. Even at a high power
density of 9864.2 W kg1
, the energy density of 32.9 Wh kg1
was retained, approaching the lower end of lithium ion
batteries.[17] Our ASC delivered much higher performance
than many reported results (Table S5). As shown in Figure 4 d, the specific energy decreased by only  1.7% after
5,000 cycles, suggesting robust stability and long operational
life.
In summary, the tetragonal SCN with high oxygenvacancy concentration was developed as an electrode material for supercapacitors, demonstrating high volumetric and
gravimetric capacitance and stable cycling performance. The
SCN/AC asymmetric supercapacitor displayed high specific
energy and outstanding stability. It is also shown that the
perovskite materials can achieve high capacitance through
the anion-insertion mechanism, paving a new way for the development of supercapacitors with high energy and power
density. The SCN has potential as a remarkable electrode in
the next-generation high-performance supercapacitors.

34_int.txt,"As one of the greatest challenges of our time, the energy demand is
growing much stronger, and we have made great efforts to develop
sustainable new energy as the substitution for traditional ones [1,2].
Among the renewable sources, supercapacitors (SCs) and lithium-ion
batteries (LIBs) are the most promising candidates for their high power
density and power density in energy storage [3,4]. SCs, in particular,
are gaining increasing attention because of their safety, ultralong service life, reliability and fast charge-discharge characteristics [5,6]. To
obtain high-performance SCs, an effective way is to develop superior
electrode materials with tailored nanostructure [7,8]. In recent years,
metal oxides, especially transition metal oxides, have been widely used
as the performance materials [9]. Distinctive from the typical electric
double-layer capacitor (EDLC), the transition metal oxides can provide
large active sites for Faradaic reversible reaction and chemical species
exchange, more than just ion exchange between both current collectors,
and these above merits deeply contribute to energy storage capacity
[10–14]. Therefore, constructing an attractive nanostructure with metal
oxides or transition metal oxides is regarded as a brilliant way for better
characteristics, a uniform nanoarrays or core-shell heterostructure
would greatly enhance the overall electrochemical performances Binary metal oxides, especially those contain transition metal
atoms, for their natural merits like robust redox reaction activity,
multiple valence states, and superior electrical conductivity, hold enormous potential as SCs electrodes materials [16–18]. Recently, ternary
ZnCo2O4 has been studied widely. Owing to the Zn atom and Co atom,
the ZnCo2O4 nano materials owns excellent electrical conductivity, rich
active sites for redox reactions, and high theoretical capacitance [19].
The oxides present an outstanding electrochemical performance
[20–23], and have already showed remarkable potential in energy device. For example, Zhao et al. assembled an all-solid-state supercapacitor based on ZnCo2O4 nanowires, it reached 49.5 mWh cm−3 at a
power density of 749.9 mW cm−3 with only a 9.3% capacitance loss
after 6000 cycles [24]. However, despite these advantages, on account
of the inner charge-storage progress, the ZnCo2O4 nanowires suffer
from poor redox reaction kinetics, which almost leads to unsatisfactory
capacitance [21]. To solve this problem, introducing moderate oxygen
vacancies could be a brilliant method.
Once the oxygen vacancies are introduced into the surface, the
electronic structure and morphology of the reduced oxides will take
changes, and the chemical property will also be altered [25]. The newly
created oxygen vacancies bring to better electrical conductivity and
strengthen redox reaction kinetics [26,27]. More importantly, the
oxygen vacancies also serve as active sites to enhance the capacitance
[28]. For example, Yan et al. used a chemical reduction method to
produce oxygen vacancies into the surface of NiCo2O4 nanowires and
nanosheets, the conductivity of both samples has obviously improved,
and the capacitance has increased by 100.4% and 77.0%, respectively
[29]. Generally, moderate oxygen vacancies can make marvelous improvements on the electrode materials and further enhance the electrochemical performance of SCs as positive materials [27].
For nickel-molybdenum transition metal oxides, the merits mainly
derives from the effective collaboration of both Ni, Mo atoms. With
drastic redox reactions in alkaline electrolyte, the Ni atoms exhibit high
capacitive performance, and the role of the Mo atoms in the oxides is
offering superior electrical conductivity [30–32]. The existence of the
Ni and Mo atoms makes the NiMoO4 nano materials highlighted in
energy storage filed. For example, Peng et al. fabricated an asymmetric
supercapacitor using prepared uniform NiMoO4 nanosheets as positive
materials, the device displays a high energy density of 60.9 Wh kg−1 at
a power density of 850 W kg−1
, with a maximum potential window of
1.7 V, and also shows an excellent stability [33]. So, the nickel-molybdenum transition metal oxides are considered to hold immense
potential in electrode materials for SCs.
Based on the above, we put forward a novel core-shell heterostructure combing the reduced ZnCo2O4 nanowires and NiMoO4·H2O
nanosheets. This unique structure takes the aligned reduced ZnCo2O4
nanowires as inner core, the prepared core framework gives scope to
good electrical conductivity and ensures the rapid transfer channels for
charges [22]. The outer shell consists of the NiMoO4·H2O nanosheets,
the uniform nanosheets supply large surface area, providing plenty
active sites and sufficient contact with electrolyte [34]. The synergistic
effect of the ZnCo2O4 nanowires and NiMoO4·H2O nanosheets makes
significant promotion to the overall performance. Moreover, this bindfree electrode grown on nickel foam effectually averts the “dead surface” compared with the slurry-made one, which makes it more convenient for chemical species exchange in the redox reaction"
35_int.txt,"The fast depletion of traditional fossil fuels and the augment in apprehension regarding 
environmental destruction have intrigued researchers to exploit clean, renewable energy 
sources and to innovate new techniques for utilization in energy storage/conversion 
devices, which is one of the most significant matters for investigators around the world.1-3
As a well-known energy storage device, the supercapacitor (SC) have attracted great 
research interests owing to their ultrahigh power density, rapid charge-discharge rate, low 
maintenance, environmental friendliness, and long-term cycle lifespan, which are 
necessary for the modern portable electronics, biomedical devices and hybrid electric 
vehicles.4-7 Up to now, the commercially available SCs, although being able to be 
recharged quickly, only store an energy density that is one to two orders of magnitude 
lower than that of the rechargeable batteries.8-10 Thus, it is significantly urgent to develop 
advanced SCs for offering higher energy density while retaining comparable high power 
delivery for practical applications. The energy density (E) generally depends on the 
supercapacitor capacitance (C) and the cell voltage (V) in accordance with the formula 
E=1/2 CV2
. Asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC), as an attractive configuration, can enhance 
the V via introducing the two dissimilar electrodes with absolutely opposite potential 
window. Hence, in this case, in order to notably elevate the energy density of the ASCs, 
rational design of the highly capacitive positive and negative electrode materials becomes 
the primary task at present. 
Currently, transition metal compounds, especially Ni-Co sulfides, have been 
extensively used for the typical positive electrode materials due to their enhanced electronic conductivity, high electrochemical activity and large theoretical specific 
capacitance,11-13 resulting in the development of high-performance positive electrode for 
aqueous SCs. In contrast, the advanced negative electrode materials are almost rarely 
studied, at present, carbonaceous species referring to active carbon, graphene, 
bio-derived carbon, et.al with excellent electrical conductivity and rapid 
charging/discharging kinetics14-16 are still the most widely used negative electrode 
candidates.17-19 Nevertheless, as we all known, these carbon materials possess quite 
low theoretical specific capacitance of 100-250 F g-1
,
20 which directly limits their 
energy density, hindering the large-scale promotion and application of the ASC 
devices. As such, transition metal oxides negative electrode materials such as MoO3,
21 Fe2O3,
22 V2O5,
23 Bi2O3
24 and Fe3O4
25 can replace the carbon-based materials to 
compensate the specific capacitance features, which display great promise for ASCs. 
Particularly, Bi2O3 has aroused extensive interests because it is cheap, easy synthesis, 
rich redox chemistry in the negative potential window, high theoretical specific 
capacitance and electrochemical stability.26-28 However, similar to other metal oxides, 
the intrinsically electrical conductivity of the Bi2O3 is inferior and the bare products 
incline to accumulation in the substrate during the preparation process, which poses a 
daunting threat to constructing the desired negative electrode materials in a practical 
manner.
Two kinds of approaches are employed to surmount the aforementioned issues. 
An viable route is through the introduction of oxygen vacancies into the electroactive 
materials. This method has been presented to enhance the electrical conductivity of some transition metal oxides since oxygen vacancies are capable of considering as 
shallow donors and thus augmenting the carrier concentration, contributing to 
improving electrochemical performance.29,30 For example, Xiang et al used wet 
chemistry method to fabricate 2D Co3O4 NSs positive electrode materials for SCs. 
The measurement results suggested that the typical specific capacitance values of the 
Co3O4 NSs with oxygen vacancies were 3.6 and 2.6 times higher than the values 
belonging to the pristine-Co3O4 and H200-Co3O4 electrodes, respectively.31 Fu et al 
constructed the yolk-shell-structured MnO2 microspheres with oxygen vacancies 
(ov-MnO2@MnO2) positive electrode via a heat treatment under a hydrogen/argon gas 
atmosphere, which showed high specific capacitance of ~426 F g-1 at 2 A g-1
, revealing 
that a 1.85-fold increase compared with untreated sample (~230 F g-1 at 2 A g-1).32 The 
technique may open up new ways to maximize the performances of the electrode 
materials. Therefore, inspired by the design concept, the Bi2O3 with oxygen vacancies 
negative electrode material is expected to further increase the capacitive properties. 
Another way is via incorporation of nanostructured Bi2O3 with conductive 
skeletons to form the hybrid negative electrode materials for ASCs. For instance, 
AC/Bi2O3,
33 MnO2/Bi2O3
34 and rGO/Bi2O3
35 negative eletrode composites have been 
investigated in prior reports, and the special capacitance can reach 332.6, 139.4, and 
94 F g-1, respectively. Despite of the great progress, their capacitance is far lower than 
that of theoretical value, hence, for the urgent applications, the development of the 
novel skeleton materials and further capacitance enhancement of Bi2O3 are important 
demands for high-performance ASCs. Tubular graphene (GNT) with the distinctive internal hollow channels, as a rising 
star in carbonaceous materials filed, possesses high electrical conductivity, excellent 
anticorrosion and antioxidation, and robust mechanical strength.36-39 The products 
have been proven to be as advanced hybrid electrode materials supporter for various 
applications in electrochemical fields. For example, Unni et al used calcination 
treatment to grow uniform iron oxide nanoparticles on the carbon nanohorn-derived 
graphene nanotubes for formation of the FeGNT composite, which could act as 
effective platinum-free fuel cell cathode, and the measurement results indicated that it 
delivered a maximum power density of 200 mW cm-2
.
40 Tabassum et al fabricated 
B/N Co-doped graphene nanotubes@cobalt phosphide architecture as superior 
electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reactions, greatly improving the catalytic 
efficiency and stability.41 In prior study,42 our group invented a facile free-template, 
one-step chemical vapor deposition (CVR) method to prepare the GNTs directly 
deposited on a graphite wafer, which enormously ensures robust adhesion and close 
contact with the current collector, and indicates total elimination of polymer binders 
or conductive agents which commonly increases additional contact resistance or 
weight, thus substantially getting rid of the “dead volume” in electrode materials. 
Moreover, the hollow N-GNTs possess larger diameter of 200-300 nm, which can be 
regarded as an effective “ion reservoir”, not only preserving the stable supply of OH- but 
also ensuring a shorter distance for ion diffusion. In addition, N doping is also conceive 
as one of the most efficient technique to elevate the electrical conductivity of 
carbon-based or semiconductors nanomaterials.43,44 Consequently, when the N-GNTs. with many superiorities are chosen as scaffolds for growing the Bi2O3, the skeletons 
not only can allow the active materials evenly distribute, offering shorter diffusion 
routes for electrolyte ions and promoting highly efficient transfer of electrons but also 
act as a buffering phase for the volume swelling and shrinking of the active materials, 
effectively averting the collapse of the composite electrode structures. Based on the 
above analysis, we think that introducing oxygen deficiencies into Bi2O3 NSAs as 
active materials, and integrating them with the N-GNTs can completely satisfy the 
crucial demands of high-performance ASCs. Meanwhile, as supporters, the N-GNTs 
may manifest the similar advantages for the positive electrode materials. However, as 
far as we know, there is no report about the development of the hybrid negative and 
positive electrode materials and their reasonable configurations for ASCs to date. 
Herein, we employed facile methods to firstly graft the oxygen-vacancy Bi2O3 NSAs 
with unique porous architecture and CoNi2S4 NPs on N-GNTs, which can be directly 
served as a new category of hybrid negative and positive electrode materials, 
respectively. The as-obtained two electrodes show high specific capacitance and 
outstanding rate performance. More significantly, a constructed ASC device 
comprises the N-GNTs@ OV-Bi2O3 NSAs negative electrode and the N-GNTs@ 
CoNi2S4 NPs positive electrode delivers high energy densities with an outstanding 
cycling performance. Considering that the development of high-energy ASC devices 
is by far in their infancy, our work makes an essential progress for the promising 
applications of high-performance ASCs in energy storages.

36_int.txt,"With the increasing global crisis of environmental pollution and
energetic problem, the development of alternative clean fuel
and energy storage technologies has attracted considerable
attention.1−4 The electrochemical reactions in these systems
including supercapacitors and electrocatalytic water splitting are
top concerns to be tackled, which usually suffer a multi-ion and
multielectron transfer process, resulting in the low efficiency of
the corresponding devices.5−9 To solve the bottleneck issues,
the key is to design and develop novel electrode materials
exposing fruitful surface active sites. Hierarchical materials with
mesoporous properties and hollow structures are widely
investigated due to their unique structural merits of large
surface areas and short ion diffusion length for improving the
mass and charge transport, as well as releasing the strain during
the electrochemical reactions.10−12 Over recent decades,
various methods including hard−soft templates and freezedrying have proved its efficacy in synthesizing well-defined
porous materials.13−16 However, these methods always involve
complicated steps, costly equipment, and toxic reagents,
resulting in low reproducibility, high cost, and poor uniformity
in porous features. In particular, when the building blocks of
the hierarchical 3D structures are porous 1D nanostructures,
the contact between electrolyte and electrocatalysts will be
largely increased in electrochemical reactions. These features
endow them with promise in the field of supercapacitors and
water splitting.
Meanwhile, increasing the number of active sites is another
important factor to boost the electrochemical performance.
Structural defects often occur in the surface of the nanomaterials, the introduction of which has considered as a valid
method to increase the active sites.17,18 It is noted that defects
on the metal oxides have a significant effect on electrocatalytic
process. The chemical bond between metal and adsorbed O2 on
oxygen defects sites will lead to the elongation of O−O bond,
which promotes the activation and partial decomposition of
O2.
19,20 Recent theoretical studies also demonstrate that
introducing surface defects opens up a new avenue to enhance
the specific capacitance, which could boost active sites,
reversibility and charge transfer.21 Thus, it is desirable to
rationally synthesize defects-enriched electrode materials with
3D porous hollow spheres, concurrently maximizing the
electrochemically active surface area and offering abundant
active sites.
Mixed-valent transition metal oxides are a class of electrochemical active materials due to their numerous valence states
compared to single metal oxides. Their electrochemical performances could be modulated by changing the metallic
elements’ states.22−24 For example, spinel copper cobaltite
(CuCo2O4) as a low cost and nontoxic binary metal oxide
exhibits high electrochemical activity and remarkable rate
capability arising from the synergistic effects of Cu and Co
ions.25 Various shaped CuCo2O4 such as nanowires, nanoparticles, and nanosheets have been obtained by corresponding
synthetic methods.26−28 However, the low conductivity,
activity, and stability restrict its electrochemical applications.
Carbon quantum dots (CQDs) with fruitful functional surface
groups such as hydroxyl and carboxyl could supply many
favorable sites for the synthesis of electroactive catalysts.29−32
Furthermore, the negative charged surface of the CQDs offers
an easy-make electrostatic interaction with positively charged
transition metal cations, which has the capacity to drive and
control over the crystal growth of shaped nanoparticles.
Therefore, one-pot coupling CuCo2O4 and CQDs with welldefined micro-/nanostructures is expected to achieve efficient
composite electrocatalysts with desirable performances because
of their potential synergistic effects and good electronic
conductivity.
In this work, a CQDs-induced hydrothermal self-assembly
strategy has been used to presynthesize CuCo-precursor with
hierarchical structures. After being annealed in Ar, the CuCoprecursor was converted to hierarchical CuCo2O4@CQDs
hollow microspheres. Benefiting from these structural characteristics, such as defects (CoII and the oxygen vacancy)
enriched surface and good electronic conductivity, the asobtained CuCo2O4@CQDs electrode shows high overall
electrochemical water splitting performance, such as good
oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and hydrogen
evolution reaction (HER) activity. In addition, an asymmetric
supercapacitor (ASC) (CuCo2O4@CQDs//CNTs) displays an
energy density of 45.9 Wh kg−1 at 763.4 W kg−1
, as well as a
long cycling lifespan."
37_int.txt,"In recent decades, supercapacitors, as a kind of devices in the field of energy storage and conversion, 
have got increasing attention1, 2 for its high powder density, excellent cycle stability and good safety. 
Supercapacitors can be divided into two types: electrical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) and 
pseudocapacitors on basis of their energy storage mechanism. EDLCs mainly include carbon materials, 
which store charges by adsorbing ions in electrolyte on the interface of electrode materials/electrolyte. 
The specific capacity depends much on the specific surface area of electrode materials, which is usually 
very low and cannot meet the requirement of development. Carbon materials for supercapacitors3
mainly contain active carbon4, 5, graphene6-8 and carbon nanotubes9, 10, which possess superhigh 
specific surface area. However, pseudocapacitors store charges by highly reversible redox reaction 
between electrode materials and electrolyte ions whose specific capacitance is much higher than that 
of EDLCs. Meanwhile, it can keep high powder density. So, pseudocapacitors have a great potential 
to obtain high energy density as well as powder density which make them hold a great promise to be 
the next generation of energy storage and conversion11. Many pseudocapacitive materials such as 
transition metal oxides/hydroxides (RuO2
12, MnO2
13, NiO14, Ni(OH)2
15), transition metal sulfides 
(MoS2)
16-18 and conducting polymers (PANI, PPy)19-22 have been introduced and studied in the field 
of supercapacitors. These studies achieve high-performance pseudocapacitors, including specific 
capacitance/rate performance/cycle stability or their integrated performance. Even so, the energy 
density of supercapacitors is still lower than rechargeable lithium-ion batteries. Rate performance and 
cycle stability of pseudocapacitors are also dissatisfactory because their unbefitting microstructures 
and poor electrical conductivity. The methods to improve the performance of pseudocapacitive 
materials can be summarized as follows23: (1) Optimize the microstructures of electrode materials. E.g., MnO2 nanorods was deposited uniformly on the surface of graphene oxide. It can avoid the 
accumulation of MnO2, which benefits to improve the speed of electrons transportation and cut the 
ions migration path down24. (2) Increase the contact area between electrode materials and electrolyte. 
(3) Explore new materials with highly active sites. E.g., ultrathin porous nickel hydroxide-manganese 
dioxide hybrid nanosheets can achieve a high specific capacity of 2628 F·g-1 (3 A·g-1)
15. However, 
these methods have not realized an excellent integrated performance in specific capacitance, rate 
capacity and cycle stability. It is proved to be a highly effective way to introduce vacancies in transition 
metal oxides25. In this way, the overall electrical conductivity of electrode materials can be improved 
effectively. Coupled with optimized microstructures of electrode materials, the excellent integrated 
performance is likely to be achieved. Moreover, aqueous electrolyte for supercapacitors usually cannot 
bear low temperature under 0 ºC, constraining the application of aqueous supercapacitors. Therefore, 
it is quite meaningful to research aqueous electrolyte that can bear low temperature.
Mo-based oxides/sulfides show high electrochemical activity for its multiple valences, which 
possess a great potential in the field of energy storage and conversion26. Among these oxides/sulfides, 
MoO3 has significant advantages in various aspects such as simple preparation process, high 
electrochemical activity and high theoretical specific capacitance, good thermal and mechanical 
stability, low cost and friendly to environment. However, the studies have been far from adequate to 
MoO3. The researches people have done to MoO3 mainly involve (1) Composite with carbon materials 
(e.g. active carbon, graphene, carbon nanotubes)27-30. (2) Composite with conducting polymers (e.g.
polyaniline, polypyrrole)20, 31, 32. (3) Reduce part of Mo6+ to lower valence (Mo5+, Mo4+ or Mo3+)
33-36
. 
Although these studies have got some achievements and breakthroughs, the essential issues have not 
been solved to achieve excellent integrated performance. The leading reasons can be concluded as follows: (1) these studies cannot achieve an entirely uniform combination between MoO3 and carbon 
or other materials in micro perspective because every phase of composite still keeps its own structure 
in a large extent. The composite exhibits integrated performance of its components only in their joints. 
(2) It seems a good way to reduce MoO3 partly because oxygen vacancies improve the intrinsic 
conductivity of MoO3
37, 38. But most studies in the past focused on secondary reduction, namely that 
fully oxidized MoO3 was prepared at first, followed by chemical or thermal reduction to obtain some 
Mo5+ or Mo4+ in MoO3. The disadvantage is that the reduction process can only be conducted on the 
surface and cannot extend to the inside of MoO3. The performance improved by this way is also very 
limited. 
Here, we put forward a simple one-step hydrothermal method that can directly grow ultrathin and 
narrow MoO3-x nanobelts with rich oxygen vacancies. It is worth noting that Mo6+ was reduced from 
interior to exterior of MoO3-x nanobelts. Mo6+, Mo5+ and Mo4+ in MoO3-x nanobelts were detected by 
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), which shows that the abundant oxygen vacancies distribute 
uniformly from inside to surface of MoO3-x nanobelts. Masses of oxygen vacancies contribute a lot to 
its intrinsic conductivity. Coupled with the ultrathin and narrow microstructure, the MoO3-x nanobelts 
electrode shows excellent performance in H2SO4 electrolyte. For solving the problem that aqueous 
electrolyte cannot bear low temperature. We innovatively prepared a new H2SO4/ethylene glycol (EG) 
aqueous electrolyte that can bear low temperature of -25ºC. MoO3-x nanobelts realized a high integrated 
performance in H2SO4/EG electrolyte at different temperature. This work was believed to promote the 
study and application of pseudocapacitive materials in the field of energy storage and conversion."
38_int.txt,"To fully utilize the intermittent clean energy sources (e.g. solar,
wind energy) for facing current energy and environmental
challenge, it is urgently needed to design and develop highperformance energy storage systems or devices. Among
currently developed energy storage devices, supercapacitors
(SCs), have attracted considerable attention due to their faster
charge-discharge rate, higher power densities, longer lifespans, and better safety tolerance than secondary batteries.
1,2
However, the large-scale applications of SCs are limited by
their relatively low energy densities.
3 Thus, how to improve
their energy density while simultaneously reserve the high
power density becomes one of the important scientific issues
in current SCs research. According to the equation E = 1/2 CV2
,
the energy densities of SCs can be increased by the following
two means: (1) expansion of the working voltage window (V)
by employing organic electrolyte or constructing asymmetric
SCs configuration; (2) designing and developing advanced
electroactive or electrode materials with high specific
capacitance (C).4,5 Though using organic electrolytes can
greatly expand the working voltage up to 3-4 V and increase
the energies of desired SCs, this strategy is still limited due to
the high cost, low safety and poor ionic diffusivity of organic
electrolytes in relative to aqueous electrolytes. Hence, most of
current studies are focusing on exploration and synthesis of
high performance electroactive materials for SCs in aqueous
electrolytes. Recently, several two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials, including graphene or heteroatom-doped
graphene,6.7 transition metal dichalcogenides,8,9 oxides or
hydroxides,10,11 and carbides or nitrides,12,13 have been
identified as promising electroactive materials for fabricating
high-performance SCs due to their high specific surface area,
large aspect ratio, excellent physicochemical and mechanical
properties, and numerous exposed active sites.
Among those 2D nanomaterials, layered double hydroxides
(LDHs) with the general formula of [M2+
1-xM3+
x
(OH)2]
x+ [Anx/n·yH2O]x-(where M2+ and M3+ are the bivalent and trivalent
metal cations, A
n− is the interlayered anions; and x = M3+/(M2++M3+)), have received considerable interest thanks to their high
flexibility on structure and composition that can bring up
variant properties, and showed potential applications in
adsorption/separation, sensing, catalysis, secondary batteries
and SCs fields.
14-17 Nonetheless, the intrinsically poor electrical
conductivity of LDHs (10-13 to 10-17 S cm-1)
18 impairs their
electrochemistry performance and greatly hinders their
practical applications in SCs. To improve the conductivity of
desired LDHs, one of the effective strategies is that integrating
LDHs nanostructures with other highly conductive materials to
generate advanced composites or nanohybrids (NHs). By far,
some bimetallic LDHs-based NHs, such as NiFe-LDH/N,S-rGO,
19
NiMn-LDH/vertically aligned graphene,
20 NiCo-LDH/CNT,21
CoAl-LDH/CoS22 or CoAl-LDH@PEDOT,23 and so on, have been
synthesized via distinct strategies, which exhibit better energy
storage capacity than the related pure LDHs. Except for
hybridization, the additional doping or incorporating another
metal to form trimetallic LDHs will effectively regulate the
electronic structure of pristine bimetallic LDHs and strengthen
the synergistic effect between incorporated metals and host
metals, helpful to boost the electrochemical properties of
desired bimetallic LDHs yet. For example, Chen and co-authors
synthesized amorphous NiCoMn-LDH by a mixed solvent
strategy, which showed greatly enhanced specific capacitance
than their bimetallic LDHs-based counterparts.24 In currently
developed trimetallic LDHs family, ultrathin few-layered or
monolayered NiCoAl-LDH nanosheets attract our interest
because they not only inherit the merits of ultrathin 2D
materials but also contain the amphoteric Al element that can
be removed by alkaline etching to create nano/micropores or
introduce abundant defects, providing another freedom by
utilizing defect engineering at the atomic scale to mediate
their electrochemical performance. However, up to now, there
are few reports on synthesis of ultrathin NiCoAl-LDHs
nanosheets or related NHs, and their applications in SCs are
not fully investigated, especially the hybridization and defect
engineering are not simultaneously employed for boosting
their supercapacitive performance.
Here, we report the preparation of ultrathin and modified
NiCoAl-LDH (m-LDH) nanosheets and N-doped reduced
graphene oxide (NRG) NHs (m-LDH/NRG), and their use in allsolid-state SCs. The typical synthesis is based on the following
three-steps: (1) the ultrathin m-LDH nanosheets are firstly
prepared by alkaline etching of NiCoAl-LDH nanosheets that
obtained via a surfactant-assisted co-precipitation route,
unlike conventional exfoliation method; (2) NRG are then
synthesized by hydrothermal nitridation and reduction of
graphene oxide (GO); (3) the ultrathin m-LDH nanosheets are
finally integrated with NRG to form advanced NHs through a
dispersing-mixing-electrostatic assembly approach. Such NHs
possess several merits compared with other analogous
electrode materials for SCs: (1) the NRG can alleviate the restacking of m-LDH nanosheets at a certain degree and offer
interconnected conducting networks for fast electron transfer
during the charge/discharge process; (2) the strong interaction
or coupling of m-LDH and NRG can efficiently regulate the
surface electronic structures of m-LDH; (3) the alkaline etching
strategy can efficiently modulate the chemical states of active
Ni/Co elements and create more oxygen vacancies that
facilitate to enhance the performance of m-LDH/NRG NHs.
Compared with pure NiCoAl-LDH and m-LDH nanosheets, the
m-LDH/NRG NHs manifest significantly enhanced specific
capacitance (1877.0 F g
-1 at 1 A g
-1), better rate capability and
cycling stability. Thus, using the m-LDH/RGN NHs as the
positive electrode and commercial activated carbon as the
negative electrode, the stacked asymmetric all-solid-state SCs
device is further constructed. Such device exhibits a maximal
energy of 19.9 W h kg-1 at the power density of 319.8 W kg-1
, a
prominent rate capability, and good cycling stability, indicating
that m-DH/NRG NHs are promising active materials for
fabrication of high-performance all-solid-state SCs with both
high energy and power densities."
39_int.txt,"Electrochemical energy storage continues to be an active field of research and development owing to 
its many areas of application ranging from portable electronics to electric vehicles. Electrification of 
transport is a particularly important application through more effective use of renewable energy [1]. 
Supercapacitors (SCs) have high energy and power densities, which suggest potential for these devices 
to compete with Li-ion batteries in energy storage applications. Hence, SCs are currently receiving 
considerable attention [2]. However, to satisfy the energy demands of next generation electronic devices, 
the energy density of SCs must be increased further. Compared with conventional SCs, asymmetric 
supercapacitors (ASC) can operate over much wider potential windows, which might lead to a substantial 
increase in the energy density of these devices. To meet the demand for high-performance ASC devices, 
there is a need to design advanced electrode structures and prepare highly active electrode materials 
[3-9]. 
Among pseudocapacitive-type electrode materials, many transition metal oxides, including binary 
metal oxides, such as NiCo2O4 [10], CoMoO4 [11], and MnMoO4 [12], have higher oxidation states than 
unitary metal oxides. These materials show promise as candidate electrode materials. Moreover, the 
electrochemical properties of NiMoO4 have been investigated by several research groups [13, 14]. Owing 
to its high redox activity and abundant reserves, NiMoO4 shows excellent potential for applications to 
next-generation SCs.
However, the poor electrical conductivity of NiMoO4 severely limits its capacitance under a high 
current densities. Many efforts have focused on fabricating nanostructures to achieve a higher specific 
surface area and a more porous structure to provide more electroactive sites for Faradaic reactions. These structures include nanowires [15], nanospheres [16], nanotubes [17], and porous nanoplates [18]. 
Furthermore, NiMoO4 has also been integrated with conductive substrates, such as metal foam and foil 
[3], carbon cloth [19], and graphene [20], to decrease the contact resistance and increase utilization of the 
active material. These studies have offered some improvements in electrochemical performance. 
However, these approaches have not improved on the intrinsic properties of the NiMoO4 [21, 22].
The intrinsic properties of the NiMoO4, including its poor electrical conductivity and weak 
electrochemical kinetics remain serious issues. To address these problems, it is necessary to modify the 
electrochemical properties of NiMoO4. The introduction of oxygen vacancies into metal oxide 
nanostructures, such as TiO2, ZnO, and Co3O4 provides one approach [23-27]. Hydrogenation also 
generates oxygen vacancies in metal oxides, resulting in a decrease of the electrical resistance [28-30]. 
The surface of nanomaterials is also charged in the hydrogenation process, which enhances adsorption 
of OH−
[30-32]. Furthermore, both nanorod and nanoflake structures remain mechanically and chemically 
stable during the cycling processes [22]. Oxygen vacancies act as active sites for redox reactions, which 
accelerates surface redox reaction kinetics [33, 34].
Here, we report a simple synthesis of oxygen-deficient NiMoO4 nanoflake arrays (OD-NF) and 
nanowire arrays (OD-NW) as electrodes for ASC devices, based on a hydrothermal step followed by 
hydrogenation. NiMoO4 nanoflake arrays (NF) and nanowire arrays (NW) were obtained in the 
hydrothermal process [35]. These products were then treated by hydrogenation to introduce oxygen 
vacancies. As expected, the as-treated OD-NF and OD-NW electrodes exhibited a high specific surface 
area and conductivity, which accounted for the greater Faradaic capacity than that of the pristine 
electrodes. Furthermore, the OD-NF showed a better electrochemical ability than that of OD-NW. The 
OD-NF electrode was assembled with activated carbon (AC) in an ASC device, which delivered remarkably high energy density of 49.1 Wh kg−1
at a power density of 800 W kg−1
and excellent cycling 
stability, with 94.2% retention after 6000 cycles at a charge/discharge current density of 10 A g−1."
40_int.txt,"There has been an increasing demand for fossil fuels originated energy in the past 
thirty years. However, it may not be possible to provide sufficient of energy as  population continues to grow and the limited amount of fossil fuels begin to 
diminish.1
 Sustainable energy sources including solar energy, wind, and tidal energy 
are emerging as promising candidates to replace the conventional fossil fuel.2
 Since 
the supply is intermittent and strongly dependent on the natural environment, the 
development of these sustainable energies has been great limited to their storage. 
Moreover, the highly efficient, low cost energy storage devices for these kinds of 
intermittent renewable energies are still one of great challenges. Supercapacitors 
(SCs), also known as electrochemical capacitors (ECs), have been recognized for 
more than fifty years and considered as one of the most potential energy storage 
systems.3-5 With the rapid growth of electronics, there is increasing demand for 
flexible or space-saving electronic devices such as wearable electronics, mobile 
phones, and flexible displays.6, 7 To catch up with the rapid growth of the demand for 
portable flexible electronics, it is essential to develop high performance and reliable 
flexible energy storage devices. In this regard, flexible supercapacitors with high 
energy density, high power density (high-rate current output/input), and high cycling 
stability must be able for the practical use of portable flexible electronics. However, it 
remains a major concern to achieve improved electrochemical performance and 
ultrahigh flexibility simultaneously. 
According to the charge storage mechanism of electrode materials in SCs, it can be 
generally divided into two categories: electrical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) and 
pseudocapacitors.8
 Figure 1 compares the specific capacitances of various types of 
electrode materials based on these two mechanisms for SCs. EDLCs mechanism 
based carbon materials store the electrical charge via physical charge separation 
process, which is strongly dependent on the pore size distribution and high surface 
area of the carbon materials. In this regard, highly conductive and chemically stable 
carbon materials with large surface area such as graphene,9-11 carbon nanotubes 
(CNTs),12, 13 activated carbon,14 have been widely used as electrode materials for 
EDLCs and achieve specific capacitances of around 50~350 F/g. Due to its 
conductive electrochemical property and physical storage process, carbon materials 
based EDLCs can achieve high power (>10 kW/kg) and long term cycle  (>105
 cycles). However, it suffers from low capacitance derived low energy density 
(1~10 Wh/kg). In contrast, conducting polymers or metal oxides based 
pseudocapacitors can deliver much higher specific capacitance due to that charges are 
stored via fast and reversible faradic reactions at the surface and bulk of the electrode 
materials. This will certainly lead to higher energy density (20~50 Wh/kg ) in 
comparison with EDLCs. It should be noted that, due to the slow diffusion of ions 
within the bulk of the electrode and relative slower charge storage mechanism 
compared with simple adsorption/desorption, the pseudocapacitors usually possess 
relatively lower power density (0.5~2 kW/kg). Additionally, it often begins to degrade 
under less than one or two thousand cycles for reasons of changes in their physical 
structure and dissolution problems. Therefore, significant efforts have been devoted in 
the past years on the concerns of pseudocapacitors.

Among various pseudocapacitive materials, manganese oxide (MnO2) is 
characterized by a low-cost (compared with highly expensive RuO2) materials with 
high theoretical capacitance (~1370 F/g) in a wider working potential window (~0.8 
to 1 V vs. Ag/AgCl in aqueous electrolytes). Over the past decades, MnO2 has become 
the most widely investigated pseudocapacitive electrode materials. Latest 
developments about MnO2 based supercapacitors have been recently reviewed.4, 16. However, the practical capacitance is around 200 ~ 600 F/g at mass loading of less 
than 1 mg/cm2
,
17 so the full potential of MnO2 for SCs still needs to be further 
exploited. Intensively explorations have shown that one major issue is crucial for 
MnO2 based SCs to achieve fascinating capacitive performance: fast electron and ion 
transportation in materials or at interface. To solve this problem, considerable effort 
has been devoted to the crystallinity,18, 19 crystal structure,20-24 morphology, nano or 
micro structural design,25-31 and vacancies introduction32-36 of MnO2 to pursue 
high-performance MnO2 based SCs. Fortunately, progress has been made within 
recent years. Herein, we review these recent progresses in MnO2 materials for flexible 
supercapacitors and discuss briefly on the current challenges and future directions, 
opportunities for the development of high-performance MnO2 based flexible SCs."
41_int.txt,"Electrochemical energy storage (EES), including batteries and
electrochemical capacitors, is widely applied for the electrification
of the transportation sector and for powering the portable electronics [1]. Electrochemical capacitors are also called supercapacitors, including electrical double-layer supercapacitors
(EDLCs) and pseudocapacitors [2]. Pseudocapacitors store energy
through reversible faradaic reactions at the surface or subsurface of
the electrode materials, proving much higher specific capacitance
than traditional carbon-based EDLCs [3]. Much research works
were carried out to explore chemical reaction mechanisms in order
to develop high performance supercapacitor electrodes [4].
Supercapacitor electrode materials can be divided into two main
groups as carbonaceous materials and pseudocapcitive materials.
Carbonaceous materials include carbon nanotubes [5e7], graphene
[8e10], and active carbons [11e13], while pseudocapcitive materials include transition metal oxides [14,15], transition metal hydroxides [16,17], and conducting polymers [18]. However, the
typical energy density of carbon-based materials is still very small,
comparing with common rechargeable batteries [19,20]. Despite
many efforts have been done on transition-metal oxides, there are
challenges that need to be addressed in order to develop desirable
electrodes [1,21,22], because most of transition-metal oxides have
poor electrical conductivities. This restricts their practical applications as supercapacitor electrodes.
Perovskite ABO3 oxides have been investigated as oxide-ionconducting electrolytes and electrodes for solid oxide fuel cells
(SOFCs) because of oxygen vacancies in their crystal structures and
structural stability at high temperatures [23e25]. Nowadays,
perovskite-type materials are also investigated as supercapacitor
electrodes. As reported by P.M. Wilde et al., properties of SrRuO3
with the perovskite type structure relevanted to electrochemical
capacitors [26]. J.T. Mefford et al. studied an anion-based intercalation pseudocapacitor electrode perovskite LaMnO3 oxide, in
which oxygen ions are charge carriers and very important for their capacitances [27]. L. Zhu et al. synthesized and characterized a
novel anion-intercalated electrode materials SrCo0.9Nb0.1O3-d for
supercapacitors [28]. LaNiO3, a Ni based perovskite oxide, has potential to be a pseudocapacitace electrode material because Ni has
several valence states, which provides the possibility for redox reaction. T. Shao et al. have reported hollow spherical LaNiO3 as a
supercapacitor electrode [29]. Nanostructured LaNiO3 and LaNiO3
composite were also reported to have potential application for
electrochemical capacitors [30e32]. However, the stability of
above-mentioned LaNiO3 electrodes is not good enough to meet
the requirement of long cyclic life for applications of supercapacitor
devices. Especially, mechanisms of ion intercalation and pseudocapacitance behaviors of perovskite LaNiO3 have not been declared
clearly and should be investigated in detail to develop novel
pseudocapacitor electrodes with high energy density, capacitance
and robust cyclic stability.
In this paper, phase composition, crystal structure, valence state
and oxygen vacancy of perovskite LaNiO3 oxides were investigated
by XRD, TEM, XPS and iodometric titration method. The electrochemical performance of LaNiO3, including cyclic voltammetry (CV)
and galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) curves in an aqueous
KOH electrolyte, were tested at room temperature. Results show
that perovskite LaNiO3 oxide is a potential pseudocapacitive electrode material with excellent specific capacitance and robust cyclic
stability."
42_int.txt,"High-performance supercapacitors are ideal electrochemical systems to bridge the gap 
between conventional capacitors and lithium-ion batteries by combining the merits of high 
energy and power density. Although extensive research efforts have been expended in this field, 
a major challenge still remains in developing novel electrode materials that possess both high 
capacitance and long cycle stability [1-4]. Perovskite oxides with ABO3 structure received lots of 
attention owing to their reversible faradaic surface reactions that allow for superior energy 
storage [5-8]. Among them, LaMnO3 is attractive due to its availability, low cost, environmental 
compatibility and good electrochemical behavior [6, 9, 10]. However, LaMnO3 suffers from 
similar limitations as other oxides, such as low conductivity and short cycle stability [7, 10].
It has been recognized that partial substitution of the A site in LaMnO3 perovskite systems
with lower valence cation (Sr2+
, Ca2+) generates electron holes in the B site. To maintain the 
electro-neutrality condition, Mn3+ can be oxidized into Mn4+ resulting in the increased electronic 
conductivity [11-13] and thus enhancing electrochemical performance. For instance, Wang et al.[10] doped LaMnO3 with Sr and reported that its capacitance was slightly increased from 187 to 
198 Fg
−1
at 0.5 Ag
−1
and the cycling life was enhanced from 40% to 80% after 1000 cycles. On 
the other hand, oxygen vacancies in LaMnO3 can also be beneficial to the electrochemical
performance. For example, Stevenson et al. [6] firstly demonstrated the anion-based 
pseudocapacitance of LaMnO3± with excellent specific capacitance (about 610 Fg−1
at 2 mVs−1
) 
as well as fast charging and discharging properties. Their finding proved that the cation and 
oxygen vacancies (point defects) played important roles in the electrochemical behavior of 
LaMnO3. However, their syntheses are complicated and time consuming. Later on, Cao et al. [9]
reported that doping both A and B sites with Sr and Cu respectively can also create oxygen 
vacancies, resulting in the improved capacitance from 100 to 464.5 Fg−1
at 2 Ag−1
.
Noting that both chemical states and point defects are influenced by the stoichiometry 
ratios, one question may be arisen whether LaMnO3 with both high concentrations of Mn4+ ions 
and oxygen vacancies can be obtained by changing its cation nonstoichiometry. Herein, we 
prepared LaMn1±xO3 (where x =0, 0.05 and 0.1) nonstoichiometric perovskite with relatively
small mesoporous size from 2 to 5 nm via a facile sol-gel method, and investigated their
morphology, phase structure, chemical states of the constituents and electrochemical properties. 
Compared with the LaMnO3 stoichiometry sample, significant differences have been observed 
regarding Mn4+ ions and oxygen vacancies, which not only improve their conductivity, but also
provide additional sites to accept more ions from the electrolyte, and hence improve the 
electrochemical performances. In particular, the LaMn1.1O3-δ is presented as a promising 
supercapacitor electrode material with specific capacity up to 202.1 mAhg−1
(727.6 Cg−1
) at the 
current density of 1 Ag-1."
43_int.txt,"With an increasing demand for electric vehicles and portable electronic devices, the need for high-performance electrical energy storage 
systems has become urgent. Supercapacitors have been paid much attentions as one of the most important energy-storage systems because of 
their high power density, excellent reversibility, fast charge–discharge 
rates and excellent cycling stability [1–5]. The electrochemical properties of supercapacitors mainly depend on their electrode materials. 
Various ternary transition metal oxides, including NiCo2O4 [6–8], 
CuCo2O4 [9–11], NiMn2O4 [12] and CoMoO4 [13], have been widely 
investigated as pseudocapacitive electrode materials, owing to the 
abundant oxidation states available for reversible redox reactions and 
synergistic effects of multiple metal species compared with 
single-component metal oxides. Among these electrode materials, 
CuCo2O4 has attracted wide attentions as a considerate storage electrode 
due to its greater electrochemical activity than single-component copper 
oxides or cobalt oxides [9,10,14–20]. Particularly, Cu, as an eco-friendly 
and cost-effective element, partial replacement of Co demonstrates to be 
a better way of reduce the toxic characteristic and high-cost of cobalt 
oxides. Nonetheless, CuCo2O4 still suffers from inferior conductivity and 
insufficient concentrations of active sites, which adversely affects its 
energy density and impedes its large-scale application. 
To overcome these challenges, various strategies have been proposed: (i) controlling the synthesis of CuCo2O4 electrodes to achieve 
particular nanostructures (onion structures, nanosheets, double-shelled 
hollow spheres, etc.) with enhanced surface area [9,10,14]; (ii) 
enwrapping CuCo2O4 particles with highly conductive materials (carbon 
nanotubes, carbon quantum dots, reduced graphenes, etc.) to improve 
their conductivity and inhibit their volume expansion [15–17]; and (iii) 
creating heteronanostructures by forming composites with other metal 
electrode materials (MnCo2O4, CuCo2S4, MnO2, etc.) to enrich the 
electrochemical performance through synergistic effects [18,20,21]. 
However, despite all these recent progresses, the complex fabrication 
processes and poor conductivity of the aforementioned materials 
severely restrict their practical application. Therefore, intrinsically 
improving the conductivity of CuCo2O4 electrodes are vital for fully 
utilising their pseudocapacitance. 
Notably, introduction of oxygen vacancies has been demonstrated as 
a convenient strategy to increase the electrical conductivity of metal 
oxides and enlarge electroactive surface area exposed to the electrolyte. 
This approach is expected to be a facile, effective and reliable strategy to 
improve the capacitive properties of electrode materials [22–25]. 
Inhibiting crystallisation or using a reductant has recently been reported 
to be an effective strategy to induce oxygen vacancies. For instance, Cao 
and co-workers showed that introducing Pd2þ during a hydrothermal 
process can lead to poorly crystalline and oxygen-vacancy-rich Co3O4, 
resulting in enhanced conductivity and redox reaction [26]. Lu et al. 
developed an oxygen-vacancy strategy involving a simple phosphating 
process, which substantially improved the electrochemical performance 
of NiCo2O4 [25]. Despite substantial achievements having been made, to 
our knowledge, there is no report on the effects of oxygen vacancies on 
the electrochemical performance of CuCo2O4. Furthermore, the development of a low-cost and effective strategy to generate oxygen vacancies 
remains a challenge. 
Herein, we report the fabrication of a mesoporous, low-crystalline 
CuCo2O4 (L-CCO) nanoflower electrode with enriched oxygen vacancies, which was synthesised by annealing precursor under a 
controllable N2:O2 volume ratio. The L-CCO, which has a chaotic lattice 
orientation and low crystallinity, functions as a shallow donor to 
enhance the electrical conductivity as well as ensuring that sufficient 
electroactive sites are exposed to the electrolyte that can greatly 
improve the kinetics of the redox reaction, resulting in excellent pseudocapacitive performance [23,26–28]. Benefiting from the aforementioned advantages, the as-prepared L-CCO electrode exhibits a large 
specific capacitance of f 1006 F g 1 A g (1.2 F cm-2 at 1.2 mA cm-2),demonstrating high rate capability and cycling stability (greater 
than 85% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles even at 50 mV s Furthermore, an asymmetric supercapacitor device with L-CCO as the 
positive electrode and active carbon (AC) as the negative electrode was 
fabricated. The device provides a substantial energy density of 58.7 Wh

performance electrochemical energy storage devices.1–3 Supercapacitor as one
of the leading candidates for the next-generation energy storage devices, has
drawn enormous attention due to the high power density and ultra-long cycling
life.1,2,4 However, the unsatisfactory energy density still hampers their further applications, e.g. hybrid electrical vehicles. Over the past few years, we have witnessed an upward trend in the research of hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs),5–7 which
combine a battery-type electrode and a traditional capacitor-type electrode and,
hence, provide high energy density and power density simultaneously. The firstrow transition metal (TM) oxides and hydroxides, e.g. NiCo hydroxides, are wellknown battery-type electrodes for HSCs, owing to their abundant redox reaction

the structural and chemical reconstruction of these TM oxides and hydroxides has
been well concerned under the oxygen evolution conditions11–13 and is a critical
piece of information for revealing the rigorous structure-function correlation. The
dynamic structural evolution of the battery-type electrodes, however, remains
largely unexplored despite its broadly appreciated complexity and importance.
Ex-situ electron microscopy, in conjunction with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS), has been applied to examine the morphology and electronic structure of
the battery-type electrodes after they were subjected to different cycling history.14–16 These results are valuable for understanding the electrode structure at
selected states that are electrochemically distinct. However, rigorous understanding
for the atomic and electronic structural dynamics in the battery-type electrodes remains predominantly speculative. It is therefore highly desirable to employ in-situ
techniques, e.g. operando X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) analysis, to capture
the dynamically evolving electronic structure and local coordination environment of
the battery-type electrodes under realistic conditions.
In this work, by combining operando XAFS, ex-situ soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy (sXAS) and synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD), we have systematically studied
the electronic and geometric structural evolution of the NiCo carbonate hydroxide
(CH) during cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycling. We reveal, for the first time, that the
NiCo CH is transformed into oxygen vacancies-enriched NiCo layered double hydroxide (LDH) under realistic reaction conditions. Such a phase transformation is
attributed to the irreversible redox of Co cations at the early stage of the CV cycling.
Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculation indicates that the unsaturated 5-coordinated Co sites in the NiCo LDH nanosheets exhibit optimal redox reaction energy
barrier. The final electrode demonstrates a remarkable high-rate electrochemical
performance. More specifically, it delivers a capacity retention of 75% at a current
density of 100 A g1

the formulation of the design principle for the next-generation HSCs electrode

45_int.txt,"Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have recently attracted ever-increasing interest 
due to their unique features including tailorable structure, large surface area, uniform 
cavity, abundant accessible active sites [1]. They have found wide applications such 
as gas storage and separation, drug delivery, catalysis sensing and energy storage 
[2-6]. Importantly, MOFs-based materials have been explored as excellent sacrificial 
templates or the precursors for a variety of metal compounds, porous carbon or their 
composites through pyrolysis or reaction with certain reagents [7-11]. The MOFs 
derived materials can thus heritage the unique morphology of MOF to promote their 
performance. Especially for supercapacitors (SCs), bulk electrode materials often 
exhibit sluggish reaction kinetics, poor electronic conductivity and volume expansion, 
leading to low specific capacitance, poor rate capability and short lifespan. The 
unsatisfactory performance. 
Co-based MOFs (Co-MOFs) have emerged as fascinating templates for the 
thermal conversion to generate porous Co3O4 structures [12-14]. The mixed-valence 
cobalt(II,III) oxide (Co3O4) is good electrode candidate for SCs due to the high 
theoretical capacity, easy preparation and rich redox reactions [15]. For example, 
Yamauchi’s group [12] prepared ZIF-67 derived nanoporous Co3O4 cages, which 
displayed a high specific capacity of 252 C g-1 at 5 mV s-1 in SCs. Sun et al. [16] 
developed ~3.5 nm thick Co3O4 hexagonal nanosheets, which showed a specific 
capacity of 1625 C g-1 at 1 A g-1 and 1267 C g-1 at 25 A g-1. However, the lack of good electron conductive routes endows Co3O4 with a capacity far from its theoretical 
value. The deposition of Co3O4 nanoseets or nanoparticles on conductive substrate 
like graphene or carbon cloth (CC) have been explored to enhance its electrochemical 
activity. In the regard, Wang’s group [17] achieved binder-free Co3O4 nanosheets on 
CC to afford a highest specific capacity of ~540 C g
-1 at 10 A g-1. However, the 
specific capacity of Co3O4 needs to be greatly improved for practical applications. 
Similar to organic electrochemistry [18], the interface properties of Co3O4
nanosheets are crucial for the electron injection/transport and electrolyte diffusion. 
One challenge remains at how to strengthen the interaction between Co3O4 and 
current collector. The use of a thin layer of conductive nanoglue is an advisable 
choice [19]. Another task is to enhance the electron transport and redox reaction 
within Co3O4. In this regard, the chemical reduction using sodium borohydride 
(NaBH4) has been established to be effective to improve the electric conductivity. 
Co3O4 is a common catalyst for the hydrolysis of NaBH4. In return, the generated 
hydrogen can serve as a strong reduction agent toward Co3O4, leading to the 
formation of oxygen vacancies [20,21]. An additional charge storage way of ions 
intercalation/de-intercalation on nanosheets/electrode interface is thus supplemented 
to electrodes. Unfortunately, the synergetic effect of as-mentioned interfacial 
engineering of Co3O4 is rarely investigated. 
Herein, we report a facile approach of engineering the interfaces of Co3O4 that 
coordinated with substrate and electrolyte. With the use of Co-MOFs as 
self-sacrificing templates, we can obtain ordered corrugated Co3O4 nanoarrays (NAs), offering an intimate electrolyte penetration and rich redox reactions sites. Our 
interfacial engineering involves two aspects: one is to enhance the adhesion effect for 
NAs with CC fibres using polydopamine derived hydrophilic carbon. Besides the 
improved stability, the electron injection is also enhanced. The other side is the 
chemical reduction of NAs to form oxygen vacancies on the surface, which can 
control the charge storage process. In oxygen-free ethanol solution, partial solvents 
are oxidized by Co3O4 nanosheets with the generation of water [22]. The hydrolysis of 
NaBH4 is further triggered to release hydrogen gas. Therefore, the chemical reduction 
of Co3O4 is allowed to proceed under a mild condition. Both interfacial treatments 
show a positive improvement in charge storage. As a result, optimized v-Co3O4/CC 
displays a high specific capacity (414 C g-1 at 1 A g-1) and excellent stability (72.6% 
capacity retention after 15000 cycles). The specific capacity is much higher than the 
counterpart electrodes without oxygen vacancies (donated as Co3O4/CC) or PDA 
treatment (donated as v-Co3O4/CC-wo). Asymmetric supercapacitor with Co-MOFs 
derived carbon nanosheets as negative electrodes also shows a high energy density."

electronic devices, back-up power supplies and electric vehicles, many efforts have 
been made in developing high performance batteries [1,2] and supercapacitors.[3–5]
Traditional lithium-ion batteries suffer from a somewhat slow power delivery or 
uptake.[6] Faster and higher power energy storage systems are critical in a number of 
applications, such as uninterruptible power suppliers (back-up supplies used to protect 
against power disruption) and airplane emergency doors, and this task has been 
assigned to supercapacitors.[3] Supercapacitors, also called ultracapacitors or 
electrochemical capacitors (ECs), have become some of the most promising 
candidates for next-generation power devices because of their overall advantages of
high power density, fast charging/discharging rate, sustainable cycling life (millions 
of cycles) and excellent cycle stability.[3,4] Many materials have been explored for 
supercapacitor electrodes, including carbon-based materials, conducting polymers, 
and both noble and transition metal oxides. Among these candidate electrode 
materials, transition metal oxides, such as NiO, [7,8] V2O5, [9] MnO2, [10–12] etc,have attracted tremendous interest due to their low cost, high energy density, and 
environmental friendliness. Of particular interest, spinel cobalt oxides and binary 
nickel cobaltite compounds exhibit many exceptional characteristics, such as good 
redox activity, high capability and extremely high theoretical specific capacitance 
(3560 F/g), [13,14] suggesting them as the most promising electrode materials for 
next generation supercapacitors.
With all the excitment about new electrode materials, less attention has been paid to 
their dynamic stoage mechanims. It has been shown that nanomaterials of Co3O4
[15-20] and NiCo2O4 [21-29] exhibit intriguing capacitive activation during 
charge/discharge cycling. In the first cycle, only a fraction of the material is active,
whereas in the subsequent cycles the electrolyte gradually penetrates into the
nanomaterials, pushing up the capacitance to a higher level. [15-29] However, the 
mechanisms for such enhanced cycling capacitance remain, to a large extent,
unknown. Several key questions are rasied, yet left unanswered: What structural 
morphology renders the electrode such enhanced cycling capacitance? Does the 
microstrucure of the electrode change during charge-discharge cycling? Does 
charge-discharge cycling generate new structure and/or materials? In this context, we
have a pressing need for a fundamental understanding of the correaltion between the 
capacitive activation and microstructure of Co3O4 and NiCo2O4 electrodes during 
charge-discharge cycling.
In this paper, we report a simple and cost-effective approach to the synthesis of
hierarchical mesporous Co3O4@NiCo2O4 nanoforests on Ni foam for SC electrode applications by a coupled one-step solution and annealing process. The synthesized 
electrode exhibits capacitive activation during charge-discharge cycling (from 0.73 
F/cm2 of the pristine state to the peak value of 1.12 F/cm2 after 2000 cycles with only 
ca.1.8% loss compared to the peak capacitance after another 2000 cycles). We 
attribute such dynamic capacitive activation to (1) enlarged electroactive surface area 
through the formation of Co3O4@NiCo2O4 core-shell structure and (2) enhanced 
electrical conductivity by forming oxygen vacancies and hydroxyl groups during 
charge-discharge cycling. Our findings provide a scientific explanation for the 
capacitive activation in cobalt oxide-binary nickel cobaltite compounds, anda new 
design guideline for the development of capacitive activation enabled, high 
performance transitional oxide electrods.

47_int.txt,"For the wellbeing of the future modern society intense research
is carried on the energy storage devices to overcome the issues
such as increasing cost of fuels, pollution, and global warming
[1,2]. Supercapacitor is one such attractive energy storage device
for applications ranging from mobile electronic devices to electric
vehicles [3–5]. Supercapacitors are also known as ultracapacitors
or in general electrochemical capacitors [6]. The performance of
a supercapacitor is reported to be intermediate to those of traditional capacitors and batteries. Batteries have high energy density
and slow kinetics due to their storage of energy in the electrode by
redox reactions, whereas supercapacitors have high power density
due to their storage of energy at the electrode/electrolyte interface
[7]. Supercapacitors have longer cycle life than batteries because
batteries’ electrochemical charge/discharge process includes phase
change in the electrode. Supercapacitors are classified into two
types, namely electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs) and pseudocapacitors, based on the energy storage mechanism [8].
EDLC, energy is stored by means of an electrostatic mechanism,
whereas in the pseudocapacitor, a faradic redox reaction is used.
The redox reaction used in the pseudocapacitor enables greater
storage of charge compared to that of the EDLC and thus higher
specific capacitance [9]. To further enhance the specific power and
capacitance of the pseudocapacitor, several attempts have been
made to find appropriate active materials. So far, active materials
such as RuO2 [10], MnO2 [11], NiCo2O4 [12], NiO [13], and Co3O4
[14] are preferred for supercapacitors due to their high power and
high specific capacitance. However, these materials also are expensive, toxic, and require complex synthesis processes; thus, despite
their superlative electrochemical performances, researchers continue to search for alternative active materials [15]. Apart from the
single and bimetallic transition metal oxides, conductive polymers
have also attracted research interest, but their low cycling stabilities represent a considerable barrier to commercialization [16,17].
In this research, we investigated the low cost, ecofriendly, and
abundant material CeO2 as an efficient supercapacitor electrode.
CeO2 has been coupled with variousmetal oxides and carbonaceous
materials to enhance its properties as an active electrode during the
electrochemical process. For example, for supercapacitor applications, a CeO2/graphene nanocomposite has been reported by Wang
et al.[18], a graphene oxide/CeO2 nanocompositehas by Ji et al. [19], a NiO-CeO2 binary oxide has been reported by Padmanathan et al. [20], and a CeO2@MnO2 core–shell heterostructure
has been reported by Zhu et al. [21]. The major drawback of CeO2
relative to other metal oxides used in supercapacitors is its low
electronic conductivity. Fortunately, however, the electronic conductivity of CeO2 can be improved simply by modifying its shape
and size [22], whereas other metal oxides must be coupled with
conductive elements.
In this study, we synthesized highly porous CeO2 nanostructures (CeO2 NSs) for application in supercapacitors by means of
solution combustion synthesis. We investigated its chemical and
physical properties are investigated using X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), field emission
scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller
(BET) surface area analysis.When applied as a supercapacitor active
material, the porous CeO2 was observed to deliver high specific
capacitance and excellent rate capability behavior. Thus, we confirmed thatmerely altering themorphology ofthe CeO2, rather than
coupling it with a conductive element, was suitable for enhancing
its electrochemical properties."

using renewable energy sources in our daily life has been made1–5. Semiconductor materials have received intense 
attentions as a potential solution to the worldwide energy shortage and for environmental purification6–11. Among 
which, hematite (α-Fe2O3), an intriguing material, is the most stable iron oxide with n-type semiconducting 
properties under ambient conditions. Owing to the attractive features, such as natural abundance, low cost, nontoxicity, chemical stability, and favorable optical band gap (ca. 2.2 eV), Fe2O3 has been intensively researched for 
applications in catalysis12–15, and supercapacitors16,17. However, it suffers the low efficiency arising from poor 
absorptive, short hole diffusion length (e.g. 2–4nm), high electron-hole recombination rate, and poor electrical 
conductivity18–20, which hinder its practical application.
Two-dimensional (2D) layered nanomaterials such as graphene have attracted tremendous research interests 
in scientific fields because of their unique properties and wide potential applications21–25. Inspired by the discovery of 2D graphene monolayer and its rich physical phenomenon, MoS2, resembling graphene, a typical example 
of 2D layered nanomaterials, has caused great interest in the past few years26–30. As a transition metal sulfide, 
MoS2 possesses many excellent properties, and its enhanced visible light absorption, proper band edge, special 
2D structures, excellent mechanical and electrical properties make it an ideal candidate to form heterojunctions31–32. In recent years, several articles have reported the successful synthesis of heterojucions based on MoS2
and show unique photocatalytic and electrochemical properties33–36, while few studies can realize the formation 
of the hybrid of 0D nanoparicles with 2D MoS2 nanosheets due to the lack of easy and effective ways to combine 
them with no agglomeration and high performance.
Based on the above considerations, we design a novel 3D flower-like Fe2O3/MoS2 hierarchical nanoheterostructure firstly through a facile hydrothermal reaction. The Fe2O3 nanoparticles guide the growth of 2D MoS2
to construct the 3D micron-size flowers, while 2D MoS2 sheets facilitate the formation and good dispersion of 
porous Fe2O3 nanoparticles with abundant oxygen vacancies. The hybrid show excellent photo-Fenton catalytic 
activity for degrading Methyl orange (MO) which belongs to the azo dyes family and is known to be carcinogenic 
and mutagenic; meanwhile, exhibit high specific capacity for supercapacitor after 6 successive cycles of photocatalytic reaction. By careful evaluation, we found that the used Fe2O3/MoS2 material show better electro performance after photo-Fenton reaction compared to the fresh materials, which may contribute to the abundant 
oxygen vacancies formed in the catalytic reaction. This provide an idea for the reapplication of scrap materials 
to eliminate secondary pollution, decrease the energy consumption and achieve the maximum use of materials, 
which may eliminate and collectively solve the problems of environment and energy."

shorter path length for electron and ion transport. With rapid 
charge and discharge rates and long life of supercapacitors, they 
are used for practical applications in electric vehicles, laptops, 
cell phones, flashlights, and memory cards8-10. In general, 
supercapacitors can be classified as electrochemical double layer 
capacitors (EDLCs) and pseudo capacitors, depending on the 
nature of interfacial processes. EDLCs are charged by the 
reversible adsorption of ions on the electrode and electrolyte 
interface of the carbon based materials with high surface area 
such as activated carbon, carbon nanotubes, aerogels and 
graphene, whereas pseudo capacitors are charged by 
conducting redox reactions on the surface of the electrodes such 
as metal oxides or by using conducting polymers. 
 Various materials such as transition metal oxides,
carbonaceous materials and conducting polymers were
investigated for supercapacitor applications11-17. Among these 
materials RuO2

 have been studied extensively due to 
their high intrinsic capacitance. However, their high cost, toxic

overcome these problems, cheaper and better materials are 
needed to replace RuO2
. Nowadays, most of the researchers 
have been working on carbon based transition metal oxides for 
supercapacitor applications11. There is vast literature available 
on transition metal based high performance supercapacitors. 
However, limited amount of research work is only published in 
the field of energy and storage based rare earth oxide materials. 
There was few report only on the effect of calcination on the 
structural and electrical properties of NiO nanoparticles and 
hence they were successfully synthesized by virtue of a single 
source precursor method which are very important for the 
improvement of energy storage technologies18,19. Consequently, 
there is a new interest found in the development of rare earth 
oxides with different morphologies as supercapacitor material. A 
few reports are very interesting on the recently developed class 
of nanomaterials whose unique photo physical properties are 
helping to create a new generation of nanomaterials in the field 
of photonics and microelectronics technology20-22. Due to the incomplete 4f shell, the trivalent and divalent ions of rare earths 
provide very interesting optical and magnetic properties. 
Different valence states exist in the rare earth oxides. It has 
been reported that the rare earth ions enhance the specific 
capacitance and cyclic stability. Particularly, CeO2
 is a promising 
rare earth oxide material which is widely used for many 
technological applications8, 23. The defects like oxygen vacancies 
in CeO2
 play an important role in catalytic, magnetic and 
electrochemical properties as the oxygen vacancies can be easily

50_int.txt,"Environment friendly, low-cost and high performance energy storage systems have been 
progressively required because of the global warming which has become 8an imperative and 
unavoidable factor. The increasing environmental setbacks along with the depletion of fossil 
fuels necessitate the tradition of solar photovoltaic and wind power as a source of electrical 
energy in practice[1, 2]. But, the unavailability of power from photovoltaic systems during night 
time and fluctuation in wind speed of the deliverable power have directed the researchers 
towards the usage of energy storage devices. Moreover, to maximize the productive use of 
electric vehicles, it is very essential to meet up with the intermittent energy needs and variable 
power demands. Correspondingly, high power delivery and long cycling stability is some of the 
most important criterion to be fulfilled by an energy storage device.[3]. To accomplish these 
demands, devices which could entail huge initial power to start up and show capability of 
charging with quicker rate are prerequisite. Therefore, supercapacitors have been explored as an 
upgraded energy storage devices to replace batteries and conventional capacitors with superior 
features[4]. Supercapacitors have fascinated great consideration in portable electronic devices 
(such as laptops, iPods), hybrid electric vehicles and memory backup systems as they possess 
environment friendly nature, fast charge/discharge rate, high specific capacitance and long-life 
cycle[5-7]. Supercapacitors have been utilized in many applications such as power back-up, 
military, aerospace, and transportation. Based on the charge-storage mechanisms, the 
supercapacitors have been categorized into two main types: electrical double-layer capacitors 
(EDLCs) and pseudocapacitors[8]. Pseudocapacitive behavior can be confirmed by the 
electrochemical signature of electroactive electrode exhibiting a linear dependency of the 
charges stored with the applied range of potential window[9]. Generally, pseudocapacitive behavior has faradaic origin and takes place at the surface of the electrode [10]. The capacitance 
can be evaluated consuming negative electrodes, positive electrodes and types of electrolyte (i.e. 
liquid electrolytes and solid/quasi-solid-state electrolytes)[4]. Usually, the enhancement in 
electrochemical behavior principally depends on higher active surface area, higher rate of 
diffusion and oxygen vacancies [11-13]. Ceria (CeO2), which is one of the most abundant and 
least expensive rare earth metal oxide, has been considered as a pseudocapacitor electrode 
material due to its environment friendly nature and excellent redox characteristics[14, 15]. These 
redox reactions mainly depends on the rate of adsorption/desorption and intercalation/deintercalation of ions on the electrode surface[16]. CeO2 nanomaterials have been explored as a 
prominent candidate for various technological applications due to their fast mutation between 
Ce4+ and Ce3+ oxidation state[17]. Particularly, the properties and applications of CeO2 strongly 
depend upon particle size, defect states and morphology[18, 19]. CeO2 possesses tunable 
electronic conductivity which can be achieved by changing its shape and size using various 
controlled synthesis methods and conditions. Therefore, to identify and optimize the controlled 
synthesis of CeO2 nanostructure is the most challenging assignment to utilize the material at its 
full potential[20]. Generally, CeO2 is not considered as a potential candidate for the
electrochemical studies because of its low electrical conductivity and higher dielectric 
constant[17]. But, the oxygen vacancies related to CeO2 plays a vital role in the surface reactivity 
properties[12, 17]. These defects can be easily created and removed from the surface of CeO2, 
which is closely associated to how easily Ce4+ reduce to Ce3+ oxidation state and vice-versa [14, 
17, 21, 22]. Such reversible transformation of Ce4+ ↔ Ce3+ oxidation state is directly associated 
to the localization/delocalization of 4f electron of cerium wherein the migration of oxygen 
vacancies in ceria occurs via hopping mechanism [17, 23]. Previously, it has been reported that the Ce3+ ratio represents the oxygen vacancies which drive the redox reactions, improve the 
electrical conductivity and electrochemical reactions [14]. Further, experimental and theoretical 
studies have investigated that the increased amount of Ce3+ valence state results to formation of 
more oxygen vacancies on CeO2 surface[24, 25]. Hence, it becomes quite important to 
understand the effect of particle size, active surface area, rate of diffusion, and most importantly, 
transition between Ce4+ ↔ Ce3+oxidation state to achieve high specific capacitance and highly 
stable electrochemical systems. Though, from the literature, it is realized that still there is a lack
of investigation for pure CeO2 based electrochemical studies due to its complex 
localization/delocalization of electrons closely linked with the intrinsic surface defects in the 
form of oxygen vacancies. Therefore, an in-depth research is needed to study the effect of 
particle size and reversible transformation of Ce4+ ↔ Ce3+oxidation state on electrochemical 
performance of CeO2 NPs. 
In this work, we have investigated the effect of particle size, reversible transformation of Ce4+ ↔
Ce3+oxidation state and intrinsic defects on the electrochemical performance of CeO2 NPs. The 
quantification of these intrinsic surface defects has been done using X-ray photoelectron 
spectroscopy (XPS), and we attempt to improve our understanding on how these defects 
associated with the improved electrochemical performance of CeO2. The effect of Ce3+/Ce4+
valence state and easy conversion potential between Ce3+ and Ce4+ oxidation states offer fast 
reversible capacity, rich redox activity and enhanced electrochemical performance. It is found 
that high surface area due to smaller particle size and presence of increasing Ce3+ valence state 
along with higher surface oxygen vacancies are key parameters for improved electrochemical 
performance of CeO2@20h NPs.

51_int.txt,"As promising energy storage devices, supercapacitors have
attracted increasing attention [1–11]. Supercapacitors have
numerous advantages over batteries, including high power density
(PD) and charge–discharge stability [12–25]. Unfortunately, their
applications are limited by a low energy density (ED). Therefore,
the development of supercapacitors that combine high ED and high
PD is necessary for advanced applications.
To date, a series of transition metal oxide/metal compounds has
been studied as supercapacitor materials [26–28]. Among these,
nickel oxide (NiO) has been widely researched because of its high
theoretical specific capacity, good chemical stability, and low cost
[29–33]. Although NiO has been reported to have a theoretical specific capacity of 3230 F/g [34], the practical capacity of NiO is still far
below this value owing to its poor conductivity and low active surface area. To resolve this issue, various noble metals (e.g., Pt [35],
Pd [36], Au [37], Ag [38], and Ru [39]) have been introduced to
improve the electrochemical capacity. However, it is still not available because of the high cost. To achieve economic and environmental sustainability, the design and development of a cheap and
efficient non-noble-metal material has become an urgent task. As
one of the most common metals, nickel has been used widely both
as a catalyst and a support in the field of electrochemical devices [40].
Oxygen vacancies, constituting one of the most familiar types of
anion vacancy in three-dimensional crystalline materials, are
widely considered to provide a useful approach for regulating the
electronic configuration and intrinsic physicochemical properties
of oxides [41]. Furthermore, synergistic effects between oxygen
vacancies and metal oxides provide unexpected potential for optimizing the electrochemical properties of a material. Such oxygen
vacancies can be confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS). Additionally, a cooperative effect between nickel, NiO, oxygen vacancies, and a carbon nanofiber supporter has been shown
to be beneficial for enhancing the electrochemical performance.
It is probable that surface oxygen vacancies with unpaired electrons act as electron donors to significantly improve conductivity
and accelerate the kinetics of surface redox reactions and thus
enhance electrochemical performance [42].
When compared with other methods for fabricating nanofibers,
electrospinning has attracted increasing attention owing to its simplicity, versatility, and low cost [43–47]. Electrospinning metal
oxide fibers is a promising method for generating composite nanofibers with a high specific surface area, high crystallinity, and an
increased number of active sites [48–49]. The resultant nanofibers
are ideal for energy storage applications because the nanofibrous
surface morphology provides a path for electron transport, which
improves the energy storage capacity of the metal oxide.
Considering this, we designed oxygen-vacancy-enriched Ni/NiO
composite nanofibers using electrospinning and a hydrogen reduction method. A reasonable strategy for achieving active materials
with high electrochemical efficiency involves manipulation of the
surface defects. The as-prepared Ni/NiO nanofibers exhibited a
long cycle life (80% of the initial capacitance retained after
1000 cycles) and high energy storage capacity. An asymmetric
supercapacitor incorporating the Ni/NiO composite nanofibers
was successfully constructed and shown to exhibit ultra-high
supercapacitive performance."
52_int.txt,"The ever-growing demands for high-performance energy 
storage systems and the potential depletion of limited resources 
for some key elements of commercial energy storage systems 
like lithium and cobalt, motivate the discovery of alternative 
systems.[1,2] Some emerging technologies for energy storage cannot be applied at a large scale and environmental concerns regarding the toxicity 
and recyclability of some materials and 
organic solvents compound the challenge. 
Aqueous-based electrochemical energy 
storage systems are considered a promising candidate due to their high power 
and energy densities, low cost, scalable 
production, long cycle life, and their environmentally safe use.[3]
Supercapacitors (or electrochemical 
capacitors) and metal-ion capacitors are 
two important electrochemical energy 
storage systems which possess these 
features to a large extent.[4] Supercapacitors should have high power density and 
long life span.[5] They can provide very 
rapid charging and discharging in addition to a very long cycle life. But their low 
energy density is still a major limitation 
when compared to conventional batteries. 
Metal-ion capacitors have been seen as 
promising for bridging the gap between 
supercapacitors and batteries. The high theoretical capacity and 
low reduction potential of zinc (Zn) metal make it a good candidate for aqueous-based energy storage systems. The relatively 
large operational voltage window of zinc metal in aqueous 
electrolytes enables it to compete in that regard with organic 
electrolytes.[6] The high ionic conductivity of aqueous electrolytes results in rapid ion diffusion, high charge accumulation,and an improved capacitance of the energy storage systems. 
All these features contribute towards very high specific capacitance, and power and energy densities.
The performance of electrochemical energy storage systems 
strongly depends on the structural, chemical, and physical 
properties of the electrode active materials, including pore size, 
pore-volume, surface area, heteroatom doping, and electrical 
conductivity.[3,7] Matching the pore size of the electrode active 
material with the size of electrolyte ion can boost the electrochemical performance.[8] Making new materials with the 
desired structural features is thus of utmost importance for efficient energy storage systems. In particular, zeolitic imidazolate 
frameworks (ZIFs) are a subclass of metal–organic frameworks 
(MOFs) that have drawn attention due to their promising 
structural properties such as their crystallinity, large surface 
area, high micropore volume, and chemical stability.[9–12] All 
these features enable them to be utilized in various applications, such as sensors, catalysis, gas separation, and energy 
storage.[9,13–15] ZIF-8 is one of the most commonly investigated 
members of the MOFs and it is formed by connecting Zn metal 
centers and 2-methylimidazole (HMIM) linkers with ZnN 
bonds. ZIF-8 has a sodalite-type crystal structure with cages of 
1.1 nm size and its specific surface area (SSA) is reported as 
high as 1947 m2 g−1 with a high reported micropore volume 
(up to 0.663 cm3 g−1).[16] Although most of the MOFs are not 
ionically/electronically conductive enough to be employed in 
energy storage systems (to the best of our knowledge, electrically conductive MOFs include Ni3(HITP)2, Cu3(HITP)2, and 
Cu[Cu(pdt)2]),[17] MOF-derived carbon materials are conductive 
and can preserve the “structural features” of the MOF from 
which they were derived, which makes them a very promising material for energy storage. ZIF-8 derived carbon materials have been reported as an electrode active material in the 
literature;[1,18] however, ZIF-8-derived carbon particles in the 
electrodes studied to date slow down the charge transfer and 
increase the contact resistance which results in a decrease of 
the capacitance.
To date, the template method is the most favorable to fabricate MOF structures in different morphologies like films, 
particles, wires or 3D structures.[9,14] The size of colloidal 
ZIF-8 particles is usually submicrometer scale and the electron transfer in ZIF-8-based electrodes is interrupted due to 
the increased number of contact points (contact resistance) and 
low percolation; the resulting higher charge transfer resistance 
hinders the electrochemical charge storage.[3] Thus, sacrificial metal oxide templates have been used to synthesis MOF 
structures with extended dimensions. Etching the metal oxide 
template by reaction with organic ligand groups initiates metalion formation and then the coordination of metal ions and 
ligand groups result in the formation of MOF structures on 
the surface of the template.[12] Depending on the morphology 
of the metal oxide precursor, MOFs having different morphologies can be grown. It has been reported that zinc oxide (ZnO) 
can serve as a Zn source to grow ZIF-8, that grows either as 
crystallites or is deposited as a thin film.[11,15,19] ZnO has very 
diverse morphologies, among them is the 3D tetrapodal ZnO 
(ZTPs), which has high aspect ratio arms, low volumetric density and is easily processed using aqueous media.[20] Similar to 
other ZnO structures, ZTPs are also defect-rich materials with 
a large fraction of oxygen vacancies. In addition, the presence 
of oxygen vacancies on their surfaces can result in unique host 
locations for MOF growth. Coordination of organic linkers with 
zinc atoms on the surface defect regions may be more favorable 
to initiate ZIF-8 growth due to the availability of a positively 
charged, vacant, and coordination site. The rapid growth of 
ZIF-8 particles on the surface defects of ZTPs in conjunction 
with a uniform ZIF-8 layer on the tetrapod surface yielded a 
necklace-like ZIF-8/ZTP structure.
This necklace-like structure with continuous core–shell 
arms and intrinsic polyhedral particles is advantageous over 
physically attached or embedded particle-nanotube/nanowire 
systems due to its continuously conductive pathways and 
unblocked porous structures.[21] Pyrolysis of the necklace-like 
ZIF-8/ZTP under inert atmosphere leads to a carbothermic 
reduction reaction and necklace-like nitrogen-doped tubular 
carbon (NTC) structures through loss of Zn vapor. This necklace-like NTC with tubular and particulate morphology may 
have the structural advantages of both components in electrochemical energy storage. Solid polyhedral regions with high 
micropore volume and high surface area can enhance the electrochemical charge storage properties. The inner tubular region 
with thin carbon walls might have high electrical conductivity 
and also facilitate charge transport; the large diameter of the 
tubular structures may serve as an “inner” electrolyte reservoir, 
resulting in rapid ionic diffusion and contributing to an “electrochemically accessible” hierarchical porous system.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the 
synthesis of a necklace-like hollow tubular MOF-derived carbon 
structure. The synthesized NTC has a high aspect ratio tubular 
interior part with mechanically stable polyhedral regions, 
uniform micropores with a large SSA, and a nitrogen-doped 
carbon structure to enable reversible Faradaic redox reactions. 
To evaluate its potential as an electrode material in energy 
storage devices, measurements of the electrochemical performance of NTC electrodes were made using univalent and 
multivalent electrolyte ions in symmetrical supercapacitor and 
zinc-ion capacitor (ZIC) devices, respectively. These two device 
architectures with NTC electrodes yielded high energy density, 
high rate capability, and good cycle life stability."
53_int.txt,"Supercapacitors (SCs) are acknowledged as the emerging energy 
storage devices for electric vehicles and portable electronic equipment 
on account of superior power density, fast charge and discharge 
behavior, eco-friendly and safe operability and excellent cycle lifespan 
[1–3]. Among the various SCs, all-solid-state SCs as an emerging 
candidate are getting extensive attention because of lightweight, small 
volume, portability and enhancive safety from lacking of liquid electrolyte [4,5]. The high energy density of SCs results from the broad operating voltage of the device and the large specific capacity of electrode materials. As electrode materials of SCs, transition metal oxides 
(like NiO [6], Co3O4 [7], MnO2 [8], NiCo2O4 [9], MnCo2O4 [10], etc.) 
reveal a much larger specific capacity owing to the reversible Faradaic 
reactions that generate on or near the surface of electrode materials, 
producing a high energy density. Among these transition metal oxides, 
NiCo2O4 with a prominent theoretical capacitance (1370 F g-1) is 
playing an increasingly significant role because of the higher electrical 
conductivity and electrochemical activity. NiCo2O4 reveals at least two 
orders of magnitude higher electrical conductivity than the monometallic NiO and Co3O4 [4,12]. The higher electrochemical activity of 
NiCo2O4 derives from multiple redox reactions contributed from 
Ni2þ/Ni3þ and Co3þ/Co4þ redox couples [4,11]. To further improve the 
capacitive performance of NiCo2O4, the various morphologies were 
synthesized to ensure efficient ionic transport and high electrochemical 
utilization of the NiCo2O4 electrode materials. NiCo2O4 hollow nanospheres with larger surface area displays a specific capacity of 1229 F 
g-1 at A g-1 1 and superior rate and cycling performance [13]. NiCo2O4 
nanowires grown on Ni foam (NF) shows a specific capacity of 830.8 F 
g-1 at A g-1 and superior rate and cycling performance [13]. NiCo2O4 
nanowires grown on Ni foam (NF) shows a specific capacity of 830.8 F 
g-1 at 2 A g-1 1 and delivers a superior cycle performance with a capacitance conservation of 80.3% after 20 000 cycles at 15 mA cm-2 The rambutan-like NiCo2O4 hierarchical architecture displays a specific 
capacity of 798 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 and a good cycling performance with 
91.7% retention of the maximum capacitance after 1500 cycles at 2 A 
g-1.. The urchin-like NiCo2O4 grown on mesocarbon microbeads 
shows the specific capacity of 458 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 and the excellent 
reversibility of 116% capacitance conservation after 3000 cycles [15]. In 
addition to morphology, the crystallinity and the presence of defects can 
impact distinctly the electrochemical performance of electrode materials. The reduced crystallinity could facilitate electrolyte penetration 
and fast ions/electrons migration and contribute to the sufficient contact 
between electroactive sites and electrolyte, leading to enhanced electrochemical performance [16,17]. For example, the amorphous NiWO4 
electrode achieves the specific capacity of 586.2 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 However, the crystal NiWO4 electrode holds only the specific capacity of 
5.12 F g-1 at 0.25 A g-1 Furthermore, the presence of oxygen 
vacancies could improve greatly electrical conductivity and electrochemical performance of electrode materials [20,21]. Kim et al. [20] 
demonstrated that the oxygen vacancies introduced into MoO3 lattice 
could cause a larger interlamellar spacing along the b axis to promote 
faster kinetics and the MoO3 structure could be held during the intercalation and extraction of Li ions, which result in the enhancive pseudocapacitive charge storage performance. Li and co-authors [22] found 
that the conductivity of SnO2-δ nanocrystal with 3.3 atom% oxygen 
vacancies is around one order of magnitude higher than that one of 
stoichiometric SnO2 nanocrystal, which leads to the enhancive incipient 
coulombic efficiency, rate capability and charge/discharge capacity. 
Hao et al. [23] fabricated the oxygen-vacancy-rich Co3O4 with low 
crystallinity electrode material. The Co3O4 electrode delivers a high 
specific capacity of 1353 F g-1  at 7 mA cm-2 2 and excellent rate and cycle 
performance. Therefore, oxygen vacancies in oxides play particularly 
important role in respect of improving conductivity because they could 
act generally as electron donors [20,22]. Herein, oxygen-vacancy-rich NiCo2O4 nanoneedles with poor crystallinity are successfully grown on NF substrate through a facile hydrothermal via annealing approach. The binder-free NiCo2O4/NF 
electrode reveals a superior specific capacity of 1076 F g-1 1 at a current 
density of 0.5 A g-1.Particularly, NiCo2O4/NF electrode delivers the 
excellent cycle stability with ~14% higher than the beginning at the 
current density of 10 A g-1 1 after 1000 cycles. Also, an all-solid-state 
symmetric supercapacitor (SSC) is constructed successfully with 
NiCo2O4/NF as anode and cathode. The SSC device based on NiCo2O4// 
NiCo2O4 electrodes delivers a maximal energy density of 30.5 W h kg-1 and a superior cycling stability with ~86% capacity retention after 500 
cycles at 2 A g-1"
54_int.txt,"Alternative energy sources and multifunctional energy storage devices have attracted much research interest 
for the demand of renewable energy and energy saving. Among various energy saving strategies, 
electrochromic devices and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are thought to be promising methods for 
the development of environment-friendly devices. An electrochromic device (ECD), where ions are injected 
into electrochromic layer during charging and whereas, during discharging, ions move backward to ions 
storage layer, show great promise in green building to decrease the cost of air conditioning and sun shading, 
and simultaneously improve the indoor living comfort.1
 On the other hand, HER is being utilized to generate
hydrogen gas for next generation clean energy fuel.2
 To date, noble metal, such as Platinum (Pt) is shown 
to be most the efficient catalyst with low overpotential and high current for HER.3 However, the high cost 
and shortage of noble metal sources limit its application. 
For the development of the above technologies, material properties play an important role. Transition metal 
oxides (TMOs) have shown great potential for low-cost and environmentally-friendly energy 
storage/conversion technologies due to their remarkable multivalence states and the associated redox 
reactions.4,5 Molybdenum oxides, a typical kind of TMO, have been identified as an emerging choice for a 
variety of applications, such as supercapacitors,6,7 hydrogen evolution reactions (HER),8
 batteries,9,10 and 
electrochromic devices (ECDs).11,12 However, the low electrical conductivity and slow reaction kinetics of 
MoO3, where Mo is in its highest oxidation state, prevent the widespread use of MoO3 in such 
applications.13,14 In recent years, the introduction of oxygen vacancies has been found to mediate these
drawbacks. The oxygen vacancies are found to serve as shallow donors and enhance charge carrier mobility, 
thus improving the electrical conductivity.15,16 Techniques, such as extrinsic N doping,17 radio-frequency 
(RF) magnetron sputtering,18 solvothermal, and vacuum sublimation method (where strict heat treatment 
and vacuum environment are required for obtaining sub-stoichiometric molybdenum oxides),19,20 were used 
to introduce oxygen vacancies in MoO3. However, these methods hinder the widespread utilization of MoO3
due to their elaborate material processing and stringent parameters control needed for high yield. 
Compared to the aforementioned methods, electrodeposition provides several unique advantages, including 
control over the film’s layer thickness, large scale scalability, low reaction temperatures, and costeffectiveness. Most importantly, the electrodeposited films are typically composed of coalesced amorphous 
nanoparticles, which provide large electrode surface area and short solid-phase ion diffusion pathways. 
Notably, these characteristics result in high electrochemical performance.21–24 Furthermore, the electric 
field applied during electrodeposition process not only binds the target material to the substrate,25 but also 
introduces oxygen vacancies, thus, altering the valence state of the film’s constituent materials.26,27 For 
example, the electrodeposition of In2O3 and MnO2 were shown to introduce oxygen vacancies and alter the 
valence state, resulting in improved electrochemical performance.28,29
 
It has previously been reported that nanoscale TMOs can be prepared from chemical precursor solution via 
electrodeposition.29–32 However, the introduction of oxygen vacancies into nanoscale TMOs material, and 
the resulting effect on their electrochemical performance has yet to be extensively explored. Herein, we 
utilize electrodeposition to form a MoO3 nanoparticle colloid onto indium in oxide (ITO)-coated glass to
show that the reduction of the valence of Mo (VI) to Mo (IV, V) and the formation of a thin MoO2+x film 
yields an enhanced super-capacitive performance. The electrodeposited MoO2+x electrode exhibits an areal 
capacitance of 89 mF cm−2
 at 1 mA cm−2
, and a negligible capacitance loss within 600 cycles. Additionally, 
the MoO2+x films possess a high diffusion coefficient for H+
 ions needed for intercalation (3.30×10−8 cm2
s
−1
) and deintercalation (1.80×10−8
cm2
 s−1
). This enhanced super-capacitive performance makes these 
electrodeposited MoO2+x films highly promising candidates as counter electrodes in complementary ECDs. 
As such, in comparison to single-active-layer ECD, the introduction of MoO2+x electrode accelerates the redox reactions at the working electrode. We show that the coloration potential of the complementary ECD 
decreases to −0.5 V and the bleaching potential reaches as low as 0.5 V. We further investigate the HER 
catalysis activity of MoO3-y where Mo is in V and VI valence states. After annealing the electrodeposited 
MoO2+x film at 200 °C for 24 hours, MoO2+x can be partially oxidized to MoO3−y and exhibits high catalysis 
activity for HER. The MoO3−y electrode shows an overpotential of 201 mV at current density of 10 mA 
cm−2 with a Tafel slope of 90 mV. Interestingly, upon annealing the MoO2+x film at 300 °C for 6 hours, the 
Mo reaches its highest oxidation state (VI), and the resulting MoO3 film exhibits a battery-like 
characteristics."
55_int.txt,"With the growing environmental issues and impending energy demands, there is a great 
necessity to develop sustainable and environment compatible energy conversion or storage 
systems [1-2]
. Supercapacitors (SCs) also known as ultracapacitors demonstrate greater 
potential in contrast to other energy storage devices owing to high charge/discharge rates, long
cycling life, little maintenance etc. However, SCs displays low capacitance values which 
disqualifies them from extending applications in wide ranging fields. Broadly, SCs store charge 
via two mechanisms either electrochemical double layer capacitance (EDLC) or
pseudocapacitance (PC)
[3-5]
. Carbon based materials exhibit EDLC behaviour, whereas
transition metal oxides/hydroxides and conducting polymers accumulate charge through PC
pathway [6-11]
. Unlike carbon materials, the transition metal oxides/hydroxides possess high 
specific capacitance as a result of faradaic reactions occurring on surface/subsurface regions. 
Nevertheless, these are unable to meet the performance of a supercapacitor due to low electrical 
conductivity and poor cycling stability aspects [12-16]
. Developing hybrid cells benefitted from 
combination of ‘carbon materials plus transition metal oxides/hydroxides’ has lately been an 
encouraging practice to enhance the energy density caused by higher operating potential
window. In general, hybrid cells constitute carbon-based materials as anode while transition 
metal oxides (or polymers) as the cathode [17]
. Since electrode material plays decisive role in 
shaping ultimate performance of a supercapacitor (or the energy storage device), a lot of 
research is carried out in this arena of science highlighting the use of novel materials with the 
outlook for developing efficient energy storage systems. It is therefore appealing to develop novel metal oxides with high specific capacitance to promote energy density of hybrid cells 
demonstrating enhanced cycling life.
Perovskite oxides recognized as ABO3 structures (where A refers to alkali/lanthanide 
earth metal and B is transition metal) present mixed electronic-ionic conductivity at elevated 
temperatures. Generating oxygen vacancies within perovskite oxides plays significant role in 
improving conductivity, stability as well the charge storage performance of material [18-20]
.
Several approaches have been explored by researchers in this regard. For instance, Mefford et 
al. described charge storage mechanism in LaMnO3 perovskite through intercalation of oxygen 
ions into its surface/bulk due to the presence of inherent oxygen vacancies in the matrix [18]
. 
Cao et al. synthesized Sr-doped LaNiO3 and discussed the role of doping low valence metal 
ions in furthering oxygen vacancy for promoting charge storage characteristics [19]
. An essential 
criterion of such intercalated/de-intercalated phenomenon observed in perovskite oxides is
phase transition that should not take place during the prevailing electrochemical reaction in 
supercapacitors as perceived in the Li-ion based battery materials [21-22]
.
Of the different perovskite oxides, it is observed that strontium cobaltite in cubic phase 
(SrCoO3-δ, SC) exhibits high electrical conductivity besides oxygen permeation flux at elevated 
temperatures in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). However, this phase is not stable at the room 
temperature and studies reveal that little doping at B-site is favourable to stabilize the phase 
and maintain a high oxygen vacancy concentration [23,24]
. In this context, Nagai et al. has 
demonstrated that doping at B-site with cations having high valence state augments oxygen 
vacancy concentration and at the same time restores the structural integrity [25]
. Lately, 
Aguadero et al. has also confirmed Mo-doped strontium cobaltite (SrCo0.9Mo0.1O3-δ, SCM) as 
a promising candidate in form of reversible oxygen electrodes equally for SOFCs and solid 
oxide electrolyzers in cathodic or anodic conditions [24].Considering the recent scenario of research on doped strontium cobaltite for charge 
storage in the arena of energy storage devices and the significance of hybrid cells, the 
undertaken work is focused on hybrid supercapacitor: SCM║LRGONR assembled using SCM 
as cathode and lacey reduced graphene oxide nanoribbon (LRGONR) as the anode material. 
Synthesis of SCM is described using sol-gel method while LRGONR is obtained by reducing 
lacey graphene oxide nanoribbons (LGONR) as reported earlier by V. Sahu et al. [26]
. Sol-gel 
is a simple, cost effective, low temperature operated and widely explored synthesis route. It 
differs from other nanoparticle synthesis methodologies in terms of delivering high purity 
metal oxides with enhanced electrical conductivity owing to improved interfacial contacts 
between grains [27,28]

56_int.txt,"Due to the continuous growth of energy demand, electrochemical energy storage is still a hot 
research field. Among the numerous new energy sources and storage devices, supercapacitors are 
favored by researchers on account of the safety, reliability, long service life, fast charging and

affecting and limiting its development [3-6]. It is necessary to research progressive electrode 
materials which own excellent electrochemical features, including specific capacitance, high rate 
performance, long cycling stability[7-9]. Metal oxides, especially transition metal oxides, have the 
advantages of high theoretical capacitance, low price and easy preparation[10, 11]. Thus, they could 
play the role of outstanding electrode materials. Moreover, transition metal oxides can provide more 
active sites for reversible faradaic reactions and chemical substance exchanges, rather than just ion 
exchanges between current collectors, which contribute greatly to energy storage capacitance[12-
14]. The redox electrolyte materials also contribute to the pseudo-capacitance performance [15-17]. 
Liu et. al. have used ingenious methods to prepare an hierarchical shell-core NiO 
nanospines@carbon electrode material with good capacitive properties[18]. When the current 
density was 2 A g-1, specific capacitance was 1161 F g-1. As the current density reached 10 A g-1
, 
specific capacitance could remain at 839 F g-1. Ma et. al. have prepared hierarchical 
ZnCo2O4@MnO2 core-shell nanotube arrays upon the surface of Ni foam matrix by a two-step 
hydrothermal approach[19]. The specific capacitance could achieve to 1981 F g-1 with current 
density at 5 A g-1
. As the current density reached 40 A g-1, the specific capacitance could remain 
1611 F g-1. In addition, Fe2O3[20], Co3O4[21], CoFe2O4[22] and NiCo2O4[23] have similarly been 
surveyed as electrode materials for supercapacitor. 
Transition metal molybdate is a candidate for a new type of electrode material for supercapacitors 
on account of its impressive electronic conductivity, such as NiMoO4[24], CoMoO4[25], 
ZnMoO4[26], FeMoO4[27]. Although their conductivity is better than that of other bimetallic oxides, 
they still fall short of expectations. The slow electrochemical kinetics also make them unfavorable.
For solving this problem, researchers are putting a lot of efforts to modify them to improve their 
electrochemical properties. Many efforts have focused on forming nanocomposite structures or 
combining with other conductive substrates[28, 29]. Chen et. al. has prepared core-shell 
NiMoO4@Ni-Co-S nanorods on nickel foam by hydrothermal and electrodeposition methods. With the current density at 5 mA cm-2, specific capacitance for NiMoO4@Ni-Co-S nanorods was 1892 F 
g

. Going through 6000 cycles, the capacity retention rate remained at 91.7% [30]. Kumar et. al.
have used a flexible method to synthesize honeycomb-structured CoMoO4-MnO2 nanocomposites 
on graphene foam[31]. With the current density at 3 mA cm-2, specific capacitance for CoMoO4-
MnO2 reached 8.01 F cm-2
. 
For CoMoO4, the hybrid structure can improve the electrochemical properties to some extent. 
However, this improvement only relies on other active materials, and does not fundamentally solve 
the intrinsic problem and improve the performance. Fortunately, introducing oxygen vacancies into 
the surface is a wise choice and method[32]. The hydrogenation reduction process can make metal 
oxides produce oxygen vacancy and reduce their electrical resistance[33]. After the formation of 
oxygen vacancy, oxygen vacancy has a positive charge, which can increase the adsorption intensity 
for OH-
[34]. The newly generated oxygen vacancy promotes the electronic conductivity and 
enhance redox reaction kinetics. More importantly, the oxygen vacancies also serve as active sites 
to improve the capacitance[35].
Herein, CoMoO4 nanosheet was firstly synthesized via hydrothermal method. The CoMoO4-x
porous nanosheet containing oxygen vacancy was obtained via the following hydrogenation process 
during which the Mo6+ was partially reduced to Mo4+. CoMoO4-x and activated carbon are separately 
employed as positive and negative materials to assemble asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC)."
57_int.txt,"The energy paradigm has changed from an era of fossil fuel
resources to sustainable energy sources and new technologies
associated with energy conversion and storage to address the rapid
depletion of fossil fuels. Currently, energy storage and conversion
technologies mainly include batteries, fuel cells, and supercapacitors (SCs).1–3 Among them, SCs have aroused considerable
interest due to their high power density (410 K W kg1
), long cycle
life (4105 cycles), and bridging function of the power/energy gap
between traditional dielectric capacitors with high power output
and batteries/fuel cells with high energy storage (Fig. 1).4–7
Based on the charge storage mechanism, SCs can be classified
into two categories:8 electrochemical double layer capacitors
(EDLCs) and pseudocapacitors (PCs). EDLCs store charge through
charge accumulation at the interface between the electrolyte and
the electrode’s surface. This process is a physical process without
any electrochemical reaction (non-faradaic), guaranteeing
fast energy uptake and delivery and avoiding the electrode
materials’ swelling. As such, EDLCs have high power density
(415 K W kg1
) and long cycle life (4105 cycles).9,10 Because of
their high specific surface area (1000–3000 m2 g1
) and desirable
conductivity, carbon-based materials (such as carbon nanotubes,
activated carbon, and graphene) are the most attractive to
date for EDLCs.11 However, experimentally, owing to the finite
conductivity and unavailability of all of the active sites, the
practical specific capacitance of pure carbon-based EDLCs
achieved has usually been limited to B100–350 F g1
.
12–14 In
comparison to EDLCs, PCs store charge via reversible redox
reaction (faradaic reaction) between the electrode materials
and the electrolyte. Since the electrochemical reactions occur
both on the surface and in the bulk near the solid electrode
surface, PCs often show far higher capacitance values and energy
density (by a factor of 10 or higher) than EDLCs.15 Metal oxides and conductive polymers typically work as electrode materials in
PCs due to their fast reversible redox reactions, cost-effectiveness
as well as easy processability.16,17 Although PCs have a high
energy density, they are not satisfactory in terms of power
density and stability due to their poor electrical conductivity
and framework swelling during cycling.18 Therefore, achieving
high energy density while maintaining the high power density of
SCs has become a challenging task.
As per the calculation formula (E = 1/2CV2
), the energy
capability of SCs is in proportion to the specific capacitance
(C) and the square of voltage windows (V). Hence, the energy of O2 can store twice charges in one charge/discharge cycle than
Li+ intercalation. Therefore, perovskite oxides have been regarded
as tremendously promising candidate materials for SCs.
To date, some high-quality reviews on perovskite oxides for
energy conversion and storage applications have been
published.36–39 However, there is still a lack of application
and development of perovskite oxides in SCs. In this review,
we first review the structure and composition of perovskite
oxides. Secondly, perovskite oxides as electrode materials for
SCs are introduced. Thirdly, the optimization strategies and
applications of perovskite oxides in SCs are discussed. Finally,
the application opportunities and challenges of perovskite
oxides in SCs are presented"

Supercapacitors and the devices for electrocatalytic water

commercial applications are still limited by the low energy
density of supercapacitors and the slow reaction kinetics of the
oxygen evolution reaction (OER).7–10 Since the electrochemical
properties are strongly related to the structural design of the
active material and the subsequent surface modication, many
researchers have focused on the rational design of highperformance and low-cost nanostructured electrodes.
Transition metal oxides (TMOs) are the most attractive
alternative electrode materials with high theoretical specic
capacitance and electrocatalytic activity.11–15 However, their
intrinsic inferior electrical conductivity, relatively low utilization efficiency and sparse active sites hinder their practical
performance.16 To address these issues, the design and
construction of 3D hierarchical heterostructures on a conductive framework can enlarge the exposed surface area and
decrease the ion diffusion pathway, thus avoiding the “dead
volume” of the active materials.17–22 In particular, cobalt
carbonate hydroxide nanowire arrays (CoCH) have good
intrinsic electrical conductivity and structural stability,23 which
make them an attractive secondary substrate.24,25 Furthermore,
the surface anion dopant and vacancy design are vital
approaches to tune the surface electronic states and create
active defects; thus, the intrinsic electrical conductivity and
activity can be improved.26 Phosphorus is considered as
a promising candidate to promote the electrochemical performance of composites.27 It is believed that phosphate incorporation into transition metal oxides can improve the reactivity
and surface wettability of the composites, thus enhancing the
energy storage and OER performances.28,29
In this paper, P-doped NiMoO4 (NiMoP) nanosheet parallel
arrays anchored on CoCH nanowires were fabricated on
a carbon cloth (CC) via the hydrothermal reaction and the
subsequent phosphorization, where the phosphorization process also introduced oxygen vacancies on the nanosheet
surface. Notably, the parallel nanosheets with quasi-onedimensional channels and a phosphate dopant could facilitate electrolyte/gas mass transfer efficiency and surface wettability, thus effectively avoiding the “dead volume” of the active
materials. Furthermore, the anion-doped and oxygen vacancyrich surface could facilitate electron transfer and provide
sufficient active sites; thus, the utilization efficiency and the
reaction activity of the active materials could be enhanced.30–36
Therefore, the NiMoP@CoCH/CC-2 electrode showed the
highest specic capacitance of 4.00 F cm2 at 1 mA cm2
, which
was superior to those of NiMoO4@CoCH/CC (0.07 F cm2
),
NiMoP@CoCH/CC-1 (3.12 F cm2
) and NiMoP@CoCH/CC-3
(3.45 F cm2
). Moreover, NiMoP@CoCH/CC-2 also exhibited
good rate capability (62.5% retention from 1 to 50 mA cm2
)
and excellent structural and cyclic stability (98.75% retention
aer 5000 cycles) in a three-electrode system. The electrocatalytic property of NiMoP@CoCH/CC-2 was also tested and
excellent OER activity (a lower overpotential of 267 mV at 40 mA
cm2
) and excellent cyclic stability were obtained in 1 M KOH.
This strategy involving the construction of parallel arrays and
dopant/vacancies with high electron conductivity and improved
electrocatalytic activity can be extended to many electrochemical applications."

kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER).7-10 Since the
electrochemical properties are strongly related to the active
materialstructural design and subsequentsurface modification,
many researches have focused on the rational design of highperformance and low-cost nanostructured electrodes.
Transition metal oxides (TMOs) are the most attractive
alternative electrode materials with high theoretical specific
capacitance and electrocatalytic activity.11-15 However, the
intrinsic inferior electrical conductivity, relatively low utilization
efficiency and sparse active sites could hinder their practical
performance.16 To address these issues, design and
construction of 3D hierarchical heterostructures on the
conductive framework can enlarge the exposed surface area
and decrease ions diffusion pathway, thus avoid the “dead
volume” of the active materials.
17-22 Particularly, the cobalt
carbonate hydroxide nanowire arrays (CoCH) have good
intrinsic electrical conductivity and structural stability,23 which
make it an attractive secondary substrate.24, 25 On the other
hand, surface anion dopant and vacancies design are vital
approaches to tune the surface electronic states and create
active defects, thus the intrinsic electrical conductivity and
activity can be improved.
26 Phosphorus is considerded as one
promising candidate to promote the electrochemical
performance of the composites.27 It is believed that the
phosphate incorporation into the transition metal oxides could
improve the reactivity and surface wettability of the
composites, thus enhance the energy storage and OER
performance.
28, 29
In this paper, the P-doped NiMoO4 (NiMoP) nanosheet parallel
arrays anchored on CoCH nanowires are fabricated on carbon
cloth (CC) via hydrothermal reaction and subsequent
phosphorization, where the phosphorization process can also
introduce oxygen vacancies on the nanosheet surface. Notably,
the parallel nanosheets with quasi one-dimensional channels
and phosphate dopant can facilitate the electrolyte/gas mass
transfer efficiency and the surface wettability, thus effectively
avoid the “dead volume”of the active materials. On the other
hand, the anion doped and oxygen vacancies-rich surface can
facilitate the electron transfer and provide sufficient active
sites, thus the utilization efficiency and the reaction activity of the active materials can be enhanced.30-36 Therefore, the
NiMoP@CoCH/CC-2 electrode shows a highest specific
capacitance of 4.00 F cm-2 at 1 mA cm-2
, which is superior than
that of the NiMoO4@CoCH/CC (0.07 F cm-2), NiMoP@CoCH/CC1 (3.12 F cm-2) and NiMoP@CoCH/CC-3 (3.45 F cm-2). Moreover,
the NiMoP@CoCH/CC-2 also exhibits good rate capability
(62.5% retention from 1 to 50 mA cm-2), excellentstructural and
cyclic stability (98.75% retention after 5000 cycles) in threeelectrode system. The electrocatalytic property of the
NiMoP@CoCH/CC-2 is also tested, an excellent OER activity (a
lower overpotential of 267 mV at 40 mA cm-2) and excellent
cyclic stability are obtained in 1 M KOH. This parallel arrays and
dopant/vacancies construct strategy with high electron
conductivity and improved electrocatalytic activity can be
extended to many electrochemical applications"
60_int.txt,"The rapid technological progress of the world in the 19th and
20th century could largely be attributed to the extensive use of
electricity in the form of small devices, such as light bulbs, and
extending to very large applications such as those powering
large mechanical units in industrial plants. However, in an
increasingly dynamic and electronic age a large number of
mobile applications still rely heavily on mechanical and
thermal energy generation and storage, which are both inefficient and generate undesirable and environmentally deleterious pollutants. Therefore, there is a pressing need for making
electricity mobile and it is imperative to develop charge storage
devices that are capable of delivering energy in a manner suitable for a variety of mobile applications such as automobiles
and electronic devices, i.e. provide energy rapidly over an
extended period of time with minimal loss over time.1,2 The
need to tailor energy storage devices to suit such applications
has been highlighted by the current targets established by the
Department of Energy,3 i.e. 7.5 W h kg1 at 625 W kg1 lasting
up to 15 years. An examination of the classic Ragone plot will
help identify the devices capable of achieving these targets.4
It has distinctly been observed that only lithium-ion batteries
(LIBs) and electrochemical capacitors have a reasonable
propensity to achieve these targets, at least as far as mobile
applications are concerned. Electrochemical capacitors are
oen referred to as ultracapacitors or supercapacitors and are
electrochemical devices that exploit the surface charge storage
properties of electrode materials, thereby enabling the rapid
charge–discharge and rendering them very attractive for high
rate mobile applications such as automobiles and electronic
devices. Supercapacitors are typically categorized into two
classes based on the nature of charge storage at the electrochemical interface.5 It is common knowledge in electrochemistry that an electrochemical double layer is formed at an
electrode–electrolyte interface as a result of the difference in the
Fermi energy levels of the electrons in the electrode and the
electrolyte. This difference in energy acts as a barrier to the
electron tunneling from the electrode to electrolyte or vice versa
until a certain potential is applied to the electrode. The electrochemical interface therefore acts as a nanometer-sized
‘double-layer’ of separated charges, resembling a conventional
dielectric capacitor.6 Charge storage devices based on this
mechanism are aptly named electrochemical double layer
capacitors (EDLCs).A second class of capacitors is termed as pseudo-capacitors
wherein charge transfer is brought about by the virtue of
reversible Faradaic electrochemical redox reactions undergone
by specic electrochemically active elements within a
compound or series of compounds. The nature of the successive
reversible electrochemical reactions of these compounds allows
the charge storage response of the device to resemble a capacitor.7 While double layer capacitors are much more reversible
and representative of rapid charge storage devices, pseudocapacitors have much higher energy densities while at the same
time maintaining moderately high rate capability on account of
the simplistic redox reactions that occur on the surface of the
electrode. One could therefore envisage hybrid composite
materials capable of both, very high rate capability and high
energy density.
The synthesis of low cost, high energy and high rate hybrid
composite materials requires us to identify a high rate double
layer material, which can be interfaced with a high energy
pseudocapacitor material with a synergistic effect occurring as a
result of the composite formed by this interaction. To date, the
most commonly studied pseudocapacitor electrode materials
are hydrous ruthenium oxide and manganese oxide, the former
limited by its high cost and the latter restricted primarily due to
its low energy density.8–11 Therefore, there is an urgent need for
the identication of economically viable pseudo-capacitor
materials, exhibiting reliably high energy densities. Transition
metal oxides are very attractive for this type of application on
account of their ability to accommodate a variety of oxidation
states. In addition, they exhibit excellent atmospheric stability
even in their nanoparticulate form, which overcomes the
handling and storage issues on a large scale. Of particular
interest to pseudocapacitor applications is the ability of the
surface oxide to undergo successive reversible electrochemical
reactions as is the case in hydrous ruthenium oxide.5,6 Hydrous
ruthenium oxide is an excellent pseudocapacitor material with
the ability to maintain stable capacitances of up to 900 F g1
over a large number of cycles.12 However, the prohibitive cost of
noble metal oxides compels the search for alternative metal
oxide materials with similar charge storage characteristics. One
such oxide resembling the multiple oxidation states of the
metal similar to Ru is vanadium oxide. Vanadium is an element
belonging to group 5 of the periodic table with a half empty dshell, thus allowing the element to exhibit multiple valence
states from +2 to +5.
Vanadium oxide has previously been studied as a material for
lithium ion battery cathodes and the different morphologies of
the oxide, including nanotubes have been explored. Both
amorphous and hydrated vanadium oxide has also been studied
widely as a viable supercapacitor electrode in lithium and
sodium ion electrolytes.13–21 Amorphous vanadium oxide gel/
carbon composites have demonstrated capacities 360 mA h g1
with very high intercalation rates. Oxide nanotubes on the other
hand have been studied extensively by Nesper et al.22,23 as electrode materials using lithium ion electrolytes and have shown
great promise. In addition, a class of the so called lithium-ion
based aqueous supercapacitors has been identied by Hu et al.
demonstrating capacitances of up to 740 F g1 in aqueous
LiCl.24–27 In all these studies, thin oxide lms have shown to
result in good electrochemical performance on account of the
short diffusion lengths for lithium intercalation. The doping of
oxides (Mo, Mn, W, Ti, Cu, and Ag) has been previously studied
as an excellent pathway to improve the electrical conductivity
and electrochemical charge storage properties.28–35 Silver and
copper doped oxides have been shown to increase the electronic
conductivities up to 2 orders of magnitude.36,37 Ti and W doped
vanadium oxide has also been shown to lead to improvements in
pseudocapacitor characteristics.38 Hence, we have chosen Ti
doped vanadium oxide as the pseudocapacitor material to be
used in the composite hybrid electrode.
The identication of an ideal double-layer type capacitor
materials to couple with doped vanadium oxide in order to form
a hybrid electrode capable of high rates is relatively complex to
tackle on account of the plethora of carbon based double layer
materials identied by the capacitor community.39–41 The
chosen material must be suitable to overcome the low electronic
conductivity usually observed in nanoparticulate oxides. We can
examine them individually to nd suitable support materials
for our application, which needs high rate capability, i.e. very
high conductivity, capacitor behavior and excellent stability in
the voltage of interest. It was also essential to maintain good
carbon material loading and good carbon–oxide interface while
at the same time avoiding thick oxide lm formation on carbon,
which makes the underlying carbon material substrate effects
redundant. Activated carbons are excellent double layer supercapacitor materials on account of their high surface area and
large pore volume.39,41 However, they suffer from the problem of
wettability, an inability to sustain a uniform dispersion on the
pores of the carbons. In addition, high surface area carbons
usually are very porous resulting in poor volumetric capacitance. Another excellent material that has been studied is graphene. Graphene, as the name suggests is a single sheet of
graphite, which allows for the ballistic 1-D transport of the
electrons leading to electronic conductivities of up to 105 S m1
in composites made with graphene.42–47 However, a major
problem with using graphene is that the individual graphene
sheets are too thin to achieve the sufficient loading of the oxide
to achieve high energy densities in practical devices.
On the other hand, an excessively thick deposit of oxide
would render the graphene sheet redundant as it would not be
able to act as an electron conducting channel to most of the
oxide material. A better solution then would be to use carbon
nanotubes (CNTs), which have very high conductivity on
account of 1-D electron transport. In addition, it is relatively
easy to generate CNTs from vertically aligned arrays, which
would ensure the direct contact of each individual CNT with the
current collector as well as creating a 3-D architecture that
would act as an ideal substrate for oxide growth.48 Carbon
nanotubes are of two types, SWNTs and MWNTs. SWNTs
usually demonstrate slightly better electrical properties than
MWNTs.49 However, the synthesis of pure vertically aligned
SWNTs is very expensive and renders the synthesis of the
composite electrodes prohibitive.49,50 In addition, the electronic
properties of single wall carbon nanotubes are very much
dependent on the nature of the graphene sheets within the nanotube as reported in the literature.51–53 Alternatively, multiwall carbon nanotubes are relatively inexpensive to synthesize
and can be synthesized on a variety of substrates.
Carbon nanotube based hetero-structures have demonstrated improved rate capabilities for various Li-ion and
supercapacitor electrode materials, including silicon, ruthenium oxide, manganese dioxide and nickel oxide.54–61 Kim
et al.14 and Balkus et al.62 have reported that electrodeposited
amorphous hydrated vanadium oxide coatings on CNTs can be
tailored to exhibit capacitances as high as 910 F g1 in lithium
electrolyte cells. In a recent report, Sathiya et al. reported the
energy storage behavior of oxide coated carbon nanotubes in a
Swagelok type cell with a lithium electrolyte and lithium
counter electrode exhibiting capacities as high as 850 mA h g1
with up to 60% of the energy storage coming from a capacitive
contribution.63 Vanadium oxide/CNT composites have also been
explored for capacitance behavior in aqueous electrolytes and
capacitances as high as 400 F g1 have been reported.64 In all
these studies, thin oxide lms have shown to result in good
electrochemical performance on account of the short diffusion
lengths for lithium intercalation. The importance of loading
and its inuence in achieving attainable capacitance in vanadium nitride based supercapacitor has been highlighted by our
earlier study.65 A recent critical review by Gogotsi et al. has
identied the need to understand the importance of thick lms
for commercial supercapacitor electrodes and the need to
report volumetric capacitance along with gravimetric capacitance.66 Nanoparticulate materials such as the oxides/nitrides of
transition metals are very advantageous in terms of achieving
desirable electrochemical performance on account of the high
specic surface area (SSA) and the enhanced activity that is
achievable on the nano-scale dimensions. However, the very
fact of having a nanoparticulate state, which is responsible for
enhanced electrochemical activity, results in a loss of electronic
conductivity on account of the large number of grain boundaries. Nanostructured vanadium oxide has a relatively low
electronic conductivity36,67,68 in the order of 106 to 102 S cm1
.
The high electronic conductivity of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on
the other hand can be exploited to create composite 3-D architectures to minimize the oxide–oxide particle contact, leading to
efficient electron transport from the current collector to the
surface of the vanadium oxide wherein the pseudocapacitance
behavior is exhibited.
In order to achieve this, an architecture comprising vertically
aligned carbon nanotubes (VACNT) covered with electrochemically active doped-vanadium oxide would be ideal to obtain
maximum capacitance while allowing for the slight expansion/
contraction as a result of the ensuing possible phase changes.
Fig. 1 shows the various architectures commonly used for
supercapacitor applications and their accompanying problems.
Previous studies have shown the effect of oxide lm thickness
on the capacitance of vanadium oxide lms prepared using
atomic layer deposition.69 However, the thicker lms of the
oxides do not yield good charge storage behavior due to the
expected limitation in electronic conductivity. Therefore, the
aim in this study was to demonstrate a CNT–oxide composite
material wherein the use of a moderately thick doped oxide
coating on a forest of vertically aligned electronically conducting carbon nanotubes should allow for minimum electron
transport limitation, while maximizing the use of active material and reducing the inactive phase weight. This should be
reected accordingly as a signicant improvement in areal
capacity, which is a measure that is more relevant and of higher
consequence than gravimetric capacity A variety of chemical methods can be utilized to synthesize
carbon nanotube–doped oxide composite hybrid electrode
materials. However, wet chemical methods usually do not
afford the freedom for tailoring the morphology of the
composite electrode as the thickness of the oxide lm deposited
on the carbon nanotubes is usually very high as the oxide
usually forms a matrix around the CNTs rather than retaining
its nanoparticle nature. The synthesis of Ti doped oxides usually
involves a sol–gel method, which is not ideal for obtaining thin
lms on carbon nanotubes.70 This leads to increased oxide–
oxide particle contact rather than carbon-nanotube–oxide electron transport. In addition, carbon nanotubes usually need to
be dispersed in an oxide solution, leading to a loss in the
alignment of the CNTs. As a result, the very purpose of using
CNTs, i.e. the one dimensional transport of electrons to the
nano-sized lm of the oxide is lost. Chemical vapor deposition
(CVD) is an ideal and versatile method to obtain uniform
architectures on carbon structures,71,72 while also tailoring the
nature of the deposited lm depending on the deposition
conditions. Various groups have previously reported CVD as a
technique for the growth of vanadium oxide thin lms54,73–79
using both chloride and metal organic precursors. Oxide lms
with varying V oxidation states have been reported with the
ratios of the oxides depending on the deposition conditions,
including temperature and reagent concentration.78
Though some improvement in the electronic conductivity
and evidence of improvement in the charge storage by the
doping of oxides has previously been demonstrated, a detailed
fundamental study correlating the supercapacitor behavior with
doping in both the nanoparticulate oxide and nitride materials
has not been undertaken. On the basis of the existing evidence
in the literature, it can be expected that rst principles
computational screening study to identify suitable dopants
could be used to predict and engineer high capacity, high rate,
and stable supercapacitor materials. Therefore, the aim of this
study was to use the doping of oxides as an approach that allows
the modication of the electronic conductivity and thereby the
electrochemical activity, as well as the electrochemical stability
of nanoparticulate oxides and nitrides. Using a theoretical
simulation involving the d-band assessment of the structure,
suitable dopants have been identied to improve the electronic
conductivity and therefore, the supercapacitor behavior of
nanostructured oxides. Using such approaches, the current
study provides a unique methodology for generating the thick
lm architectures of doped vanadium oxides grown on vertically
aligned CNTs (VACNTs), resulting in capacitance values that are
uniquely distinct from the values currently reported in the
literature. Accordingly, in this study, an atmospheric pressure
chemical vapor deposition (APCVD) method has been explored
to deposit titanium doped-vanadium oxide on vertically aligned
carbon nanotubes for use as a supercapacitor electrode in
aqueous media. The implementation of CVD as a synthetic
method also provides the advantage of avoiding the incorporation of binders for generating the electrodes, which can
consume up to 50% of the total weight of the electrode in high
surface area systems contributing largely to the inactive dead
weight.55,72 As a result of the improved electronic conductivity of
doped vanadium oxide and the high conductivity of vertically
aligned carbon nanotubes, we are able to demonstrate high
gravimetric capacitances in thick electrodes resulting in high
areal capacities as well."
61_int.txt,"Supercapacitors (SCs) are highly promising to meet the highpower demands in hybrid electric vehicles, regenerative energy 
harvesting systems, and portable electronics due to their fast 
charge/discharge capability and long cycle life.[1–4] The energy 
density of SCs based on double-layer capacitance, however, is 
very low as compared with that of batteries.[5–7] In recent years, 
the development of pseudocapacitive materials that enable 
redox reactions at or near the material surface brings the hope to increase the energy density of SCs to 
the battery level.[8–12] However, most of 
the pseudocapacitive materials (such as 
MnO2, SnO2, and Fe2O3) possess sluggish ion diffusion and electron transport, 
which result in low bulk utilization for 
charge storage and limited gain in energy 
density for these pseudocapacitors.[9,13,14]
Therefore, it is still a topical challenge 
for pseudocapacitors to boost the quickresponse charge storage sites beyond the 
electrode–electrolyte interface.
Among various pseudocapacitive materials, tin oxide (SnO2) has attracted intense 
attention as a negative electrode for SCs due 
to its appropriate working potential window 
(0 to −0.9 V vs Ag/AgCl), large theoretical 
specific capacitance, environmentally 
benign nature, low cost, and so on. Nevertheless, the reported SnO2-based electrodes 
achieved limited practical capacitance of 
less than 200 F g−1
, which is far below its 
theoretical expectation.[15] Consequently, intensive efforts have 
been devoted to enhancing the specific capacitance of SnO2
without comprising the power capability. Most of the previous 
works focused on how to increase the electronic conductivity of 
the SnO2-based electrodes by introduction of oxygen vacancies, 
doping, and incorporation with conductive materials (carbon 
materials, conductive polymers, etc.).[16–19] Despite enhanced performance, the pseudocapacitive charge storage of SnO2 at high 
rate is still localized at the surface due to the sluggish ion intercalation into the bulk. This limitation could be overcome in principle by engineering interfaces in SnO2, which generally possess 
more fluent cation diffusion as compared with that of pure bulk 
SnO2.
[9,20,21] For example, Guo and co-workers designed an SnS/
SnO2 heterostructure with much lower Na+ diffusion resistance 
and increased electron mobility, benefiting from the induced 
hetero-interfaces.[21] Thus, these results inspired us to engineer 
interfaces in SnO2 from the perspective of promoting cation 
accommodation and electronic conductivity simultaneously.
Herein, we report hierarchical SnO2−x nanoparticles (NPs)@
SnO2−x nanosheets (NSs) architectures, of which abundant 
homo-interfaces are designed along with oxygen vacancies to 
boost quick-response cation storage sites and electron transfer 
simultaneously, thus leading to significantly increased pseudocapacitance at high charge/discharge rates. The density 
functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate the homo-interfaces of SnO2−x NPs@SnO2−x NSs prefer to accommodate 
lithium-ion intercalation in comparison with the near-surface of SnO2−x. More importantly, the generation of oxygen defects 
is more favorable around homo-interfaces than around the 
surface, making the stable Li+ storage sites at homo-interface 
readily accessed by the Li+ during the charge storage process. 
The SnO2−x NPs@SnO2−x NSs electrode delivers a specific 
capacitance of 376.6 F g−1
 at a current density of 2.5 A g−1
 and 
retains 327 F g−1
 at a high current density of 80 A g−1
. To further demonstrate the feasibility of the SnO2@SnO2−x electrode 
at the device level, a 2.0 V asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) 
with SnO2−x NPs@SnO2−x NSs anode and α-MnO2 nanowires cathode is constructed. The maximum energy density 
of SnO2−x NPs@SnO2−x NSs//MnO2 device is 68.3 Wh kg−1
(at 997 W kg−1
). Impressively, an energy density of 26.4 Wh kg−1
is still retained even at a high power density of 10 kW kg−1
. The 
oxygen-deficient homo-interface design offers a new vision for 
realizing high-energy as well as high-power supercapacitors."
62_int.txt,"Renewable and clean power sources and energy storage1-3 have been long-sought 
objectives, with many efforts devoted toward developing high-performance batteries4, 
5
 and supercapacitors (SCs).6 In recent years, SCs have attracted considerable interest 
as energy-storage devices because of their advantages of outstanding power density, a 
fast charge-discharge process and a long cycle life.
7,8 Therefore, many materials have 
been considered for use as SC electrodes, including carbon-based materials based on 
forming two charge layer on the contact surface of the electrode material and the 
electrolyte,8-11 conducting polymers derived from the rapid and reversible redox 
reaction of N-type or P-type doped and de-doped in the polymer conjugated chain 12,13
and both noble and transition metal oxides through redox reactions occurred in the interface of electrode material and electrolyte.14,15 Among the candidate electrode 
materials, transition metal oxides with highest theoretically specific capacity and low 
cost, such as NiO,16-18 V2O5,
19and MnO2,
20 have received especially strong interest. In 
particular, spinel cobalt oxides (Co3O4) and binary nickel cobaltite compounds 
(NiCo2O4) exhibit many exceptional characteristics, such as good redox activity, high 
capability, and extremely high theoretical specific capacitance, thus suggesting that 
they are the most promising electrode materials for next-generation SCs.21-25
Over the past few years, much research has been focused on developing new 
strategies to improve the electrochemical properties of NiCo2O4 nanomaterials for SC 
electrodes. Notable progress, such as exploring the core-shell structures of compounds 
like NiCo2O4@MnO2

increased the electrochemical performance of NiCo2O4 for SC electrodes. However, 
most of these compounds have limitations, such as high cost triggered by the complex 
process or being difficult to utilize in industrial applications. Hydrogenation, regarded 
as the green and effective way to modify the structure, has been applied in improving 
the performance of TiO2

hydrogenated NiCo2O4 nanograss. In this context, we have a pressing need for a 
fundamental understanding of the correlation between the capacitive enhancement 
and microstructure of NiCo2O4 electrodes. In this paper, we report a simple and cost-effective approach that employs 
hydrogenation to improve the performance of NiCo2O4 nanograss on Ni foam for SC 
electrode applications. After hydrogenation, the synthesized electrode exhibited large 
increases in capacitive performance (from 0.88 F cm-2 (338.5 F g-1) in the initial state 
to 2.1 F cm-2 (807.7 F g-1) after 3 h of hydrogenation). Moreover, the capacity 
retention was remarkably promoted from 54 to 71 % at high current density after 3 h 
of hydrogenation. We attribute this significantly improved electrochemical 
performance to enhanced electrical conductivity observed by in situ TEM electrical 
test, resulting from oxygen vacancies forming in the disordered structure on the 
surface of the hydrogenated NiCo2O4 (H-NiCo2O4) nanowires (NWs). Our work not 
only proposes a simple route for improving the capacitance of NiCo2O4 but also 
provides a guideline for developing green and performance-enhanced supercapacitors."
63_int.txt,"The extraordinary growing demand for portable electronic devices 
and hybrid electric vehicles motivates the pursuit of energy storage 
devices with long cycle life, ultrahigh power, and high energy density. 
Li-ion batteries are currently the most commonly used options for 
commercialization because of their superior energy density, but the 
looming concerns over scarce resources, expensiveness, and safety 
severely hamper their wider utilization [1,2]. As an alternative, supercapacitors (SCs) are emerging as one of the most compelling candidates 
for their higher power density, good reversibility, long life span and safe 
nature, which make them have qualification to become an ideal choice 
of driving power source for next-generation electronic devices [3–5]. 
Nevertheless, the low energy density is one of the most burning questions demanding prompt solution for the popularization of SCs. 
To circumvent this problem, substantial efforts have been made toward increasing the energy density of SCs, such as enhancing the specific 
capacitance or maximizing the cell voltage. Up to now, great research 
attention has been attracted on how to design high specific capacitance 
of electrode materials, especially pseudo-capacitive materials (including 
conductive polymers [6,7] and transition metal oxides/sulfides [8–10]), 
which embrace ultrahigh theoretical capacitance and excellent electrochemical activity. NiCo2O4 (NCO) is believed to be a promising pseudocapacitive material owing to its many impressive merits like low cost, 
natural abundance and environmental friendliness [11]. Besides, 
compared to those of common monometallic counterparts (e.g., NiO and 
Co3O4), NCO exhibits higher electrochemical activity by virtue of the 
multiple oxidation states (i.e. Co2+/Co3+/Ni2+/Ni3+) and faster reaction 
kinetics [12,13]. Nonetheless, NCO generally suffers from a realization 
handicap, that is, the drastically structural distortion in charge storage 
process automatically degrades the energy storage capability due to 
poor electrical conductivity and inferior mechanical/chemical stability 
[14]. To enhance the electrochemical property of NCO, various morphologies are designed, such as 1D nanorods [15,16], 2D nanosheets 
[17,18], and 3D nanoflowers [19,20]. Whereas, the limited electrons 
transfer and low availability of active sites still lead to unsatisfactory 
capacitance characteristics. On the other hand, NCO-based hybrid 
electrode materials with complex heterostructure are prepared to  enhance the electrochemical properties that are synergistically associated with specific capacitance, electrical conductivity, and structure 
durability. For instance, NCO@NiWO4 core–shell nanowire [21], 
NCO@PANI nanorod [22], NCO/rGO honeycombed-like nanosheet 
[23], and NCO@CNT/CNT [24]. However, their complicated preparation processes and uncontrollable morphologies are still undesired 
issues. 
As an efficient solution, heteroatom-doping (e.g., N, P and S atoms) 
can enhance the intrinsic activity over each site of metallic oxides by 
optimizing those electronic structure, thus increasing the electronic 
conductivity [25–27]. For example, the lone-pair electrons around N 
atoms are able to better interact with the metal atoms, the resulting 
M− O− N bonds have longer bond length and higher electronegative than 
the pristine M− O bonds, which weakens attraction of Co2+/Co3+/Ni2+/ 
Ni3+ to the 3d electrons and decreases the electron transport energy, 
which improves the reaction kinetics [13,28]. Interestingly, the 
embedded N atoms in the lattice of metallic oxides will substitute the 
place of partially innate O atoms, resulting in a great number of oxygen 
defects. The existence of defects will disturb the surrounding atoms to 
some extent and induce lattice distortion in the crystalline materials, 
which are able to effectively regulate the electronic structure, chemical 
properties and electrical conductivity of the materials [29]. Choi et al. 
reported a N-doped and oxygen vacancy-rich spinel NCO prepared by a 
simple NH3 plasma active strategy [25]. The introduced N atoms not 
only fill up the oxygen vacancies in the mesoporous NCO surface but also 
lead to the formation of both nickel and cobalt nitrides, which endow 
the NCO electrode with a striking specific capacitance of 4434.68F g− 1 
at 5 A g− 1
. Wang et al. used N atoms as the active dopant to induce an 
amorphous layer (NiCoON) accompanied with oxygen vacancy on the 
surface of NCO [14]. The synergistic effects of oxygen vacancies and 
massive multivalent metal cations, the optimized NiCoON electrode (as 
the anode for Li-ion capacitors) displays substantially enhanced electronic conductivity, extraordinary rate capacity, and impressive capacity. Therefore, the befitting doping of N and oxygen vacancies 
contributes to eliminating the obstacles on the electrochemical properties of NCO. Furthermore, it is well known that the specific surface area 
(SSA), pore size and pore distribution of the porous active substances 
greatly affect the electrolyte permeation and ion transport kinetics, 
thereby affecting the overall electrochemical abilities of the electrode. 
The microporous (<2 nm)/mesoporous (2–50 nm) materials with high 
SSA and rich 3D pore networks will increase the electrode–electrolyte 
interface area and alleviate the volume change during charge/discharge 
process [30,31]. Thus, a reasonable design, which aims at integrating 
doping, defects and surface-structural engineering, is significant to 
improve the charge storage ability, rate capability, and cycle stability of 
SC electrode materials (especially for NCO), which was barely reported 
in previous works.

64_int.txt,"The extraordinary growing demand for portable electronic devices 
and hybrid electric vehicles motivates the pursuit of energy storage 
devices with long cycle life, ultrahigh power, and high energy density. 
Li-ion batteries are currently the most commonly used options for 
commercialization because of their superior energy density, but the 
looming concerns over scarce resources, expensiveness, and safety 
severely hamper their wider utilization [1,2]. As an alternative, supercapacitors (SCs) are emerging as one of the most compelling candidates 
for their higher power density, good reversibility, long life span and safe 
nature, which make them have qualification to become an ideal choice 
of driving power source for next-generation electronic devices [3–5]. 
Nevertheless, the low energy density is one of the most burning questions demanding prompt solution for the popularization of SCs. 
To circumvent this problem, substantial efforts have been made toward increasing the energy density of SCs, such as enhancing the specific 
capacitance or maximizing the cell voltage. Up to now, great research 
attention has been attracted on how to design high specific capacitance 
of electrode materials, especially pseudo-capacitive materials (including 
conductive polymers [6,7] and transition metal oxides/sulfides [8–10]), 
which embrace ultrahigh theoretical capacitance and excellent electrochemical activity. NiCo2O4 (NCO) is believed to be a promising pseudocapacitive material owing to its many impressive merits like low cost, 
natural abundance and environmental friendliness [11]. Besides, 
compared to those of common monometallic counterparts (e.g., NiO and 
Co3O4), NCO exhibits higher electrochemical activity by virtue of the 
multiple oxidation states (i.e. Co2+/Co3+/Ni2+/Ni3+) and faster reaction 
kinetics [12,13]. Nonetheless, NCO generally suffers from a realization 
handicap, that is, the drastically structural distortion in charge storage 
process automatically degrades the energy storage capability due to 
poor electrical conductivity and inferior mechanical/chemical stability 
[14]. To enhance the electrochemical property of NCO, various morphologies are designed, such as 1D nanorods [15,16], 2D nanosheets 
[17,18], and 3D nanoflowers [19,20]. Whereas, the limited electrons 
transfer and low availability of active sites still lead to unsatisfactory 
capacitance characteristics. On the other hand, NCO-based hybrid 
electrode materials with complex heterostructure are prepared to enhance the electrochemical properties that are synergistically associated with specific capacitance, electrical conductivity, and structure 
durability. For instance, NCO@NiWO4 core–shell nanowire [21], 
NCO@PANI nanorod [22], NCO/rGO honeycombed-like nanosheet 
[23], and NCO@CNT/CNT [24]. However, their complicated preparation processes and uncontrollable morphologies are still undesired 
issues. 
As an efficient solution, heteroatom-doping (e.g., N, P and S atoms) 
can enhance the intrinsic activity over each site of metallic oxides by 
optimizing those electronic structure, thus increasing the electronic 
conductivity [25–27]. For example, the lone-pair electrons around N 
atoms are able to better interact with the metal atoms, the resulting 
M− O− N bonds have longer bond length and higher electronegative than 
the pristine M− O bonds, which weakens attraction of Co2+/Co3+/Ni2+/ 
Ni3+ to the 3d electrons and decreases the electron transport energy, 
which improves the reaction kinetics [13,28]. Interestingly, the 
embedded N atoms in the lattice of metallic oxides will substitute the 
place of partially innate O atoms, resulting in a great number of oxygen 
defects. The existence of defects will disturb the surrounding atoms to 
some extent and induce lattice distortion in the crystalline materials, 
which are able to effectively regulate the electronic structure, chemical 
properties and electrical conductivity of the materials [29]. Choi et al. 
reported a N-doped and oxygen vacancy-rich spinel NCO prepared by a 
simple NH3 plasma active strategy [25]. The introduced N atoms not 
only fill up the oxygen vacancies in the mesoporous NCO surface but also 
lead to the formation of both nickel and cobalt nitrides, which endow 
the NCO electrode with a striking specific capacitance of 4434.68F g− 1 
at 5 A g− 1
. Wang et al. used N atoms as the active dopant to induce an 
amorphous layer (NiCoON) accompanied with oxygen vacancy on the 
surface of NCO [14]. The synergistic effects of oxygen vacancies and 
massive multivalent metal cations, the optimized NiCoON electrode (as 
the anode for Li-ion capacitors) displays substantially enhanced electronic conductivity, extraordinary rate capacity, and impressive capacity. Therefore, the befitting doping of N and oxygen vacancies 
contributes to eliminating the obstacles on the electrochemical properties of NCO. Furthermore, it is well known that the specific surface area 
(SSA), pore size and pore distribution of the porous active substances 
greatly affect the electrolyte permeation and ion transport kinetics, 
thereby affecting the overall electrochemical abilities of the electrode. 
The microporous (<2 nm)/mesoporous (2–50 nm) materials with high 
SSA and rich 3D pore networks will increase the electrode–electrolyte 
interface area and alleviate the volume change during charge/discharge 
process [30,31]. Thus, a reasonable design, which aims at integrating 
doping, defects and surface-structural engineering, is significant to 
improve the charge storage ability, rate capability, and cycle stability of 
SC electrode materials (especially for NCO), which was barely reported 
in previous works.

65_int.txt,"Environmental pollution and energy depletion urgently require human to develop 
clean renewable energy and green energy storage devices.1 As one type of clean 
energy storage devices, supercapacitors (SCs) have been attracting widespread 
interest due to the low cost, high power densities, fast charge-discharge rate and long 
cycling life.2-4 Although SCs can provide higher power density than secondary 
batteries and store more energy than physical capacitors, the recently achieved energy 
densities of SCs are still lower than the increasing requirement in practical 
applications. As given in the equation for energy density ( 2
2
1
= CUE , where C and U
are the specific capacitance and the potential window, respectively), broadening the 
potential window is one of the efficient strategies to enhance the energy density of 
SCs.5 Although organic electrolyte based SCs can operate at high cell voltage (~ 3.0 V) 
and exhibit high energy densities,6-7 the high cost, toxicity and low safety severely 
limit their widespread applications. In recent years, aqueous asymmetric 
supercapacitors (ASCs), combining the battery-type or pseudo-capacitive electrodes 
(transition metal oxides/hydroxides/sulfides) with the electric double layer capacitive 
electrodes (carbon based electrodes), exhibited high cell voltages (> 1.6 V) and high 
specific capacitances.8-11 However, limited by the electrolytic water splitting reaction 
(
22
isElectrolys
2O2H → + O2H , the theoretical voltage value for water split is 1.23 V), 
the cell voltages of the aqueous ASCs still hardly exceeds 2.0 V, hindering the further 
enhancement of their energy densities.12-13
 
Exploring novel positive electrodes with ultrahigh over-potentials for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) or/and novel negative electrodes with ultrahigh 
over-potentials for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is one of the key issues to 
elevate the voltage of aqueous ASCs. The Ti substrate self-supported binder-free TiO2
based electrodes with ultra-negative redox potential in neutral electrolytes,14-15 high 
chemical/electrochemical stability and high over-potential towards HER for both 
substrate (Ti) and active materials (TiO2)
16-17 are considered as the ideal negative 
electrodes to assemble high voltage aqueous ASCs.18 However, the poor electric 
conductivity of the wide band gap semi-conductive TiO2 phase (~ 3.0 eV) and the low 
active materials loading (~ 1.0 mg cm-2)
18 in the binder-free electrodes strongly 
restrict the further energy density enhancement of the TiO2 electrode based ASCs. 
Although hyperbranched nanowire arrays structure19, multi-layered structure20-21 and 
3-D structure22 have been applied to increase the active material loading in the TiO2
based electrodes in the fields of lithium ion batteries and dye-sensitized solar cells, the 
poor electric conductivity of TiO2 will cause the low active material utilization when 
the hyperbranched or multi-layered TiO2 electrodes were used in ASCs, which 
required much higher operating current density during the charge/discharge process. 
Moreover, excessive hyperbranch and closely packed multi-layered structure will 
deteriorate the transport channels for electrolyte ions, limiting the fast 
charge/discharge process in ASCs. Thus, constructing suitable three dimensional (3D) 
nano-level structure to increase the TiO2 active material loading coupling with the 
optimization of electric conductivity and ionic transport pathways of the TiO2 based 
electrode is significant to enhance the energy density of the high voltage aqueous ASCs but still a great challenge. 
Herein, a highly-ordered binder-free multi-layered 3D carbon coating 
hydrogenated TiO2-II phase nanowire arrays (NWAs) electrode (denoted as ML-HTO) 
was constructed to markedly increase TiO2 active material loading with the 
synchronous improvement of the electric conductivity and ionic transport via some 
ingenious strategies. Firstly, the highly ordered 3D multi-layered TiO2 NWAs scaffold, 
constructed via the introduction of a carbon coating network layer with good TiO2/C 
contact, not only provides a continuous pathway for electronic conduct but also offers 
a high surface area substrate for the growth of second TiO2 NWAs layer. Secondly, the 
hydrogenated high pressure α-PbO2 type TiO2-II phase with small grains and high 
oxygen vacancy (Ti3+) concentration endows the TiO2 based active material low band 
gap (2.39 eV) and more positive flat-band potential (-0.35 V vs SCE), corresponding to 
high intrinsic electric conductivity and easy charge transfer, respectively. Thirdly, the 
highly ordered scaffold-like 3D tunnel structure and the hydrophilic surface with rich 
oxygen-containing functional groups (eg. -OH) provide suitable pathway for ionic 
transport and accessibility, represent for the high ionic diffusion coefficient 
( + Na D =3.08 x 10-8 cm2
 s-1). For these reasons, the as-prepared ML-HTO electrode 
exhibits high areal specific capacitance of 710.7 mF cm-2, which is nearly triple 
higher than that of the single layered hydrogenated TiO2 NWAs electrode (258.7 mF 
cm-2). Consequently, the firstly assembled MnO2//ML-HTO aqueous ASC with the 
ML-HTO electrode as the negative electrode and the carbon cloth supported MnO2
electrode as the positive electrode, exhibits an ultrahigh cell voltage of 2.4 V, an ultrahigh energy density of 90.3 Wh kg-1 at 349.0 W kg-1 and a ultrahigh volumetric 
energy density of 9.6 mWh cm-3 at 61.0 mW cm-3. Moreover, the charge/discharge 
mechanism of the novel ML-HTO negative electrode is also carefully discussed here. "
66_int.txt,"Supercapacitors are essential components for high-rate electrochemical energy storage devices with rapid charge/discharge ability, 
high power density and outstanding cycling stability. Generally, transition metal oxides with variable valence state can store charges vis 
reversible redox reactions, and high theoretical capacitances make them 
promising electrode materials for supercapacitor. Manganese dioxide 
(MnO2), with high theoretical specific capacitance (1370F g− 1
), is 
documented as a potential alternative to commercial RuO2 as electrode 
material of supercapacitor [1–6]. However, poor electrical conductivity 
(10− 5 to 10− 6 S cm− 1
) and sluggish ion transfer property are two 
essential points that deteriorate the charge storage process of MnO2, 
both of which are closely correlated with the electronic configuration. 
Therefore, regulation of electronic configuration can be the essential 
strategy to boost charge storage performance of MnO2 electrode. 
Recently, defect engineering has been deliberately an effective way 
for the electronic configuration regulation on metal oxides [7–10]. As 
such, oxygen vacancies can induce the formation of new gap states and 
effectively achieve desirable electronic configuration, then improving 
the electrical conductivity [11]. Meanwhile, oxygen vacancies can tune 
the cation adsorption Gibbs free energy and influence the adsorption/ 
desorption behavior [12–14]. Oxygen vacancies can also supply a cation 
transfer path across metal-O layer and an extra adsorption site [15,16]. 
Furthermore, local electric field formed around the oxygen vacancies 
was reported to accelerate electron/ion transfer rate in organic electrolyte and ameliorate interfacial charge transfer property in aqueous 
electrolyte [17–21]. Nevertheless, oxygen vacancies were commonly 
formed on the surface and edge site of metal oxides, optimizing the 
interfacial electron/ion transfer property and leaving the bulk metal 
oxide still inactive. Sluggish charge transfer process in bulk inactive 
metal oxide deteriorate capacitance and rate capability in aqueous 
supercapacitor. Above all, it is desirable to construct bulk oxygen vacancies to ameliorate the bulk charge transfer kinetics. However, the 
construction of bulk oxygen vacancies remained rarely explored, and the 
effect of bulk oxygen vacancies on energy storage still need further 
investigation. 
Herein, MnO2 with rich bulk oxygen vacancies (MnO2-C) was successfully prepared through complex induced chemical precipitation. The 
resulted MnO2-C exhibits a remarkably increased (5-fold) oxygen vacancies concentration compared to the control sample of MnO2, 
determined by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). Densityfunctional theory calculations were further used to verify that oxygen 
vacancies can distinctly induce reduced band gap and electron delocalization, then promoting fast electron transfer. According to Bader 
charge analysis and charge density differences, more electron transfer 
and higher electron delocalization degree can be achieved with 
increased oxygen vacancies concentration. Thus, robust local electricfield can be formed in bulk MnO2-C and accelerate ion transfer kinetics, resulting remarkably enhanced capacitance and rate capability. 
Further simulations on Na+ adsorption and diffusion barrier confirm 
rich bulk oxygen vacancies can accelerate Na+ ion diffusion. Our work 
presents a facile strategy to achieve high bulk oxygen vacancies concentration and offers insights into the effect of bulk oxygen vacancies on 
energy storage process."
67_int.txt,"Developing devices to store energy conveniently, controllably and 
sustainably is critical to solve issues of energy crisis and environmental pollution.[1] Supercapacitors have emerged as highly 
efficient and promising energy storage devices in intermittent 
renewable energy sources, smart power grids, and electrical 
vehicles, due to the higher power density, longer durability and 
safety over traditional fuel cells and batteries.[2] Great efforts have   been made on elaborating the electrode 
materials with higher energy density for 
supercapacitors to meeting ever-increasing 
requirements. The energy density (E) of 
a supercapacitor is mainly dependent on 
the specific capacitance (C) and cell potential window (V) of electrode materials 
according to the equation E = 1/2CV2
.
[3]
Thus, developing electrode materials with 
enhanced specific capacitance is crucial for 
high-energy supercapacitors. Carbonaceous 
material based electric double-layer capacitors appear with a low capacitance due to 
the physical absorption/desorption at the 
electrode surface.[4] Comparatively, transition metal oxides (TMOs) and conductive 
polymers (CPs) based pseudocapacitors 
exhibit higher theoretical storage capacitance because of the reversible faradic reactions on or near the electrode surface.[5]
Vanadium pentoxide (V2O5), a layer-structured TMO, has 
prospective applications in electrochemical energy storage 
due to its high theoretical capacitance (2020 F g−1
), a broader 
operating voltage( up to ≈2.8 V), as well as low cost and abundance in nature.[6] However, the poor electrical conductivity of 
V2O5 (10−3
 to 10−2
 S cm−1
) limits the electron transfer kinetics 
for redox reactions. As a result, the pseudocapacitive reactions 
mainly occur on the surface or near-surface region of V2O5
electrode materials, leading to a low utilization of V2O5 and 
unsatisfactory specific capacitance.[7] In addition, the vanadium 
dissolution and structural instability reduces its cycling life.[8]
To address these problems, many synthetic methods have 
been proposed. First, nanostructured V2O5 materials with a large 
specific surface area are fabricated to provide sufficient contact 
area for fast Faradic reactions, such nanoribbons,[9] and nanobelts.[10] Second, tailoring the materials with multiple physicochemical properties can effectively enhance the electrochemical 
performance of V2O5 with diverse functions from components. 
For instance, layered V2O5/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) 
(PEDOT)/MnO2 nanosheets show enhanced energy density 
(39.2 W h kg−1
) and cycling stability (93.5% capacitance retention after 3000 cycles) due to the synergistic combination of 
PEDOT, MnO2, and V2O5.
[11] However, V2O5 electrode materials 
with enhanced electrochemical performance, fabricated in an 
uncomplicated and low-cost process are still necessary for practical applications. Based on the previous study, both polyaniline 
(PANI) and PEDOT improve the electrical conductivity as well 
as the stability of V2O5 by forming a conductive coating,[8,11].while PANI has the advantage of easier preparation and lower 
aniline monomer cost (3.6 $ mL−1
) over EDOT monomers 
(9.6 $ mL−1), which can be found in supporting information. 
Defects, especially oxygen vacancies (Vö), have been reported 
to intrinsically enhance the charge transfer kinetics and cycling 
performance of V2O5 by modifying its surface chemistry and 
electronic properties.[12] Therefore, it would be significant to 
improve the electrochemical performance of V2O5 by rationally integrating PANI and Vö into nanostructured V2O5 with an 
easy and simple method.
In this work, nanofiber-like V2O5 (V2O5-NF) are engineered 
with Vö and PANI at the surface region through one-step in situ 
oxidatively polymerization of aniline monomers. In the resultant 
Vö-V2O5/PANI nanocables, a local electric field is induced and 
provides Coulombic forces to promote the ion diffusion due to 
unbalanced charge distribution caused by Vö. The porous PANI 
shell offers an external percolated pathway for fast charge transport. The enlarged surface area also benefits redox reactions with a 
larger contact area. Thus, the charge transfer kinetics is enhanced 
by the interface modifications of Vö and PANI. Consequently, 
Vö-V2O5/PANI electrode manifests an excellent specific capacitance, energy density as well as a superior cycling life."
68_int.txt,"Aqueous supercapacitors are attractive for energy storage due to their high safety, low cost, and 
fast ion diffusion kinetics.[1-6] However, the energy density (E ~ 30 to 60 Wh kg−1
) of most reported 
aqueous supercapacitors is lower than that of rechargeable batteries, limiting their commercial 
practicability.[7-12] E is determined by the specific capacitance (C) and cell voltage (V) of the device, 
according to the equation E = 1/2 CV2
. Thus, the improvement of E requires the increase of C and/or V. 
While C can be modified by activating more charge storage sites on electrodes, V of an aqueous cell is
thermodynamically limited by the water splitting potential of 1.23 V.[13] Nevertheless, approaches 
have been made to kinetically push this limit.[14, 15] For example, Xia et al. reported the Na0.5MnO2
nanowall arrays showing a high upper potential limit of 1.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which can be used as the 
high-performance cathode for a 2.6 V aqueous supercapacitor.[13] A Ni-Mn-O solid-solution cathode 
was developed with a wide potential window of 0 – 1.4 V vs. saturated calomel electrode (SCE).[16] 
With the reaction taking place near the water splitting potential, the oxygen evolution reactions (OER) 
are significantly suppressed and the potential window is extended.[17] While some progress has been 
made on the cathode side, the development of pseudocapacitive anodes with wide potential window, 
high specific capacitance and long cycle life is still highly demanded. Recently, a 2.7 V aqueous 
supercapacitor was developed by coupling the Na0.25MnO2 cathode (0 – 1.3 V vs. SCE) with the 
Na+
-adsorbed carbon anode (−1.4 – 0 V vs. SCE), refreshing the cell voltage record of aqueous supercapacitors.[18] Yet, this carbon anode delivers a specific capacitance of 204 F g−1
 at the current 
density of 1 A g−1
 due to the limited charge stored via the electric double layer mechanism, leading to 
moderate energy density. 
Since the pioneer work on lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) by Goodenough et al. in 1997, 
great achievements have been made on polyanion cathode materials for rechargeable batteries with 
enhanced safety and cycling stability.[19] Similar excellent electrochemical properties can be expected 
for their applications in supercapacitors as well. Molybdenophosphate (A-Mo-P-O, A = Na, K et. al) 
materials, an important family of polyanionic phosphate compounds,[20-22] are promising candidates 
for energy storage. In their structures, MoO6 octahedra share corners with PO4 tetrahedra to build up 
open tunnels, allowing fast ion diffusions.[19] The inductive effect of PO4
3−
 decreases the electron 
density on the Mo center and weakens the covalency of Mo-O bonds.[23] The specific electrochemistry 
of these compounds can be tuned by adjusting the interactions between phosphate and Mo center. 
Furthermore, the molybdenum in phosphate compounds may exist in various valence states (Mo4+
, 
Mo5+, Mo6+, etc.), which would enable multi-electron transfer reactions.[24] A few molybdenum 
phosphate-based materials [such as γ-(MoO2)2P2O7[24] and δ-(MoO2)2P2O7[25]] have been studied for 
lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries; however, molybdenophosphate based materials have never been 
reported for supercapacitors, to the best of our knowledge. The favorable features of 
molybdenophosphates inspire us to investigate their applications as pseudocapacitive electrode 
materials. 
Herein, we report a new molybdenophosphate material as a high-performance anode for 
supercapacitors. The material was deposited on a three-dimensional exfoliated graphite current collector via a facile electrochemical method. The electrochemically activated electrode (A-MoPO/EG) 
exhibits a high specific capacitance of 556 F g−1
 at the current density of 4.5 A g−1
 and excellent 
cycling stability with no capacitive decay over 100 000 cycles, superior to most of the reported 
pseudocapacitive anode materials. By coupling with a manganese oxide cathode, a 2.7 V aqueous 
asymmetric supercapacitor was assembled. With the excellent performance of the electrodes and high 
cell voltage, the device delivers a high energy density of 89 Wh kg−1
 at the power density of 2733 W 
kg−1."
275_Intro.txt,"The growing demand of portable electronic devices such as mobile 
phones, watches, smart computers and rollable displays implicates the 
development of portable energy storage devices able to provide energy 
during several days. Those energy storage devices should be flexible, 
lightweight, inexpensive and mechanically strong [1–3]. The electrochemical energy storage devices such as lithium-ion or sodium-ion 
batteries, metal-air batteries, multi-cation batteries and supercapacitors (SCs) have emerged as the most suitable candidates for the 
energy storage due to their long lifetimes and high efficiency [4,5]. 
Among these energy storage devices, the SCs are preferred due to their 
extraordinary features such as: ultra-fast charge/discharge rates, easy 
fabrication, low maintenance cost, ultra-long lifetime, excellent safety 
and high-power density in comparison with the batteries [6–9]. 
Furthermore, they can be flexible, wearable and ultra-thin [10]. All 
these qualities mentioned above have been reported in the literature. 
For example, Balamurugan et al. [11] reported solid state supercapacitors using the Ni-Mo-S and Ni-Fe-S nanosheets as SC electrodes. 
The devices made with those materials generated a high energy density 
of 82.13 Wh/kg and had remarkable capacitance retention of 95.86% 
after 10,000 cycles of charge/discharge. Another report of the same 
research group demonstrated that flexible SCs can be fabricated using 
nanoporous manganese nickel selenide (MnxNi1-xSe2) and manganese 
iron selenide (MnxFe1-xSe2) nanosheets as the cathode and the anode 
[7], respectively. The optimized devices produced a maximum energy 
density of 87.2 Wh/kg and capacitance retention of 96.2% after 10,000 
cycles of charge/discharge. Additionally, electrodes such as α-MnSe/ 
carbon-textile [8] and MoS2/carbon-clothes (CC) [12] have been successfully employed for the fabrication of flexible SCs, which provided 
capacitances of 200–368 F/g, energy densities of 5.42–55.42 Wh/kg as 
well as high capacitance retention of ≈96–97.2% after 5000 cycles of 
charge/discharge. Furthermore, Javed et al. [9] studied the performance of asymmetric SCs made with ZnCo2O4/carbon-textile as the cathode and Ti3C2Tx-MXene as the anode. The devices showed a high 
capacitance of 281.25 F/g (at 0.5 A/g) and remarkable energy density of 
99.94 Wh/kg. The cycling stability was also high because the authors 
obtained a capacitance retention over 94% after 5000 charging/discharging cycles. Finally, the research group of Javed et al. [5] evaluated 
the electrochemical performance of asymmetric supercapacitors fabricated with electrodes of Co1Ga2O4@CC as the cathode and activated‑carbon@CC as the anode. The best devices exhibited a maximum 
capacitance of 239 F/g, energy density of 84 Wh/kg and capacitance 
retention of 93–95% after 10,000 charging/discharging cycles. 
In order to store huge quantities of energy, the electrodes of the SCs 
should have a large specific surface area and high electric conductivity 
[13]. For this purpose, the graphene has been widely used, since it has a 
2D structure that provides a high specific surface area and enhances the 
planar electric transportation. In addition, the graphene is chemically 
very stable and has high mechanical strength [14]. Due to these properties of graphene, numerous works have used it and its derivatives 
(graphene oxide or reduced graphene oxide) for the fabrication of 
supercapacitors. For instance, Balamurugan et al. [3] designed flexible 
asymmetric SCs using electrodes made of: N-doped graphene encapsulated with nickel‑cobalt nitride (NiCo2N) and nickel–iron nitride 
(NiFeN). This device produced a high energy density of 94.93 Wh/kg 
and had outstanding capacitance retention of ≈95% after 24,000 cycles 
of charge/discharge. Also, Liu et al. [15] fabricated a SC device with 
graphene-based electrodes and showed a capacitance of 154.1 F/g and 
energy density of 85.6 Wh/kg. Moreover, Bokhari et al. [16] designed an 
asymmetric SC fabricated with graphene-based hybrid nanocomposites. 
This device exhibited a capacitance of 120.1 F/g, energy density of 66.6 
Wh/kg and capacitance retention of 88% after 3000 cycles of charge/ 
discharge. Another work by Dai et al. [17] reported that a Ni(HCO3)2/ 
rGO nanocomposite electrode exhibited a high specific capacity of 
846C/g and capacitance retention of ≈73% when the current is varied 
from 1 to 20 A/g. Moreover, they constructed a solid state supercapacitor by using the Ni(HCO3)2/rGO electrode as the anode and the 
rGO as the cathode, which produced a high energy density of 66 Wh/kg 
and a capacitance retention of 92% after 10,000 cycles of charge/ 
discharge at 20 A/g. Finally, Balamurugan et al. [18] fabricated an 
asymmetric supercapacitor formed by nitrogen-doped-graphene/cobaltencapsulated‑nitrogen-doped‑carbon nanotubes (NG/Co–NCNT hybrid 
as the positive electrode and NG (nitrogen doped graphene) as the 
negative electrode. The device exhibited a maximum specific capacitance of 196.7 F/g, energy density of 88.44 Wh/kg and a retention of its 
initial capacitance of 94.9% after 10,000 times of charge/discharge at 1 
A/g. 
Although the graphene-based SCs have demonstrated good capacitive properties, the use of metal oxides together with graphene has been 
a good strategy to enhance the electrochemical performance. In this 
sense, Gupta et al. [19] demonstrated that graphene-foam/manganese 
oxide nanocomposite electrodes can produce a high capacitance of 
672 F/g and high energy density of 95 Wh/kg. This electrode exhibited a 
high electrochemical stability, since only 2% of the initial capacitance 
was lost after 10,000 continuous charge and discharge cycles. Furthermore, Liu et al. [20] synthesized a NiO/Ni/rGO three-dimensional coreshell electrode and this one had a maximum capacitance of 2048.3 F/g 
and moderate capacitance retention of 77.8% after 10,000 cycles of 
charge/discharge. Moreover, Pieretti et al. [21] made an electrode of 
reduced-graphene-oxide (rGO)/WO3 and produced a maximum capacitance of 287 F/g and capacitance retention of 70% after 3000 cycles of 
charge and discharge. As observed, mixing the graphene with the NiO, 
MnO2 and WO3 produced high capacitance values but the morphology 
and size of these oxides are difficult to replicate, this in turn, difficult the 
electrochemical stability of the electrodes containing these materials. 
Also, their costs of fabrication become expensive and their synthesis 
procedures become complex/long when these oxides are processed for 
the mass production. For those reasons, a simpler and cheaper oxide is 
suitable to be mixed with the graphene. 
A possible candidate to improve the electrochemical properties of the 
SC could be the Zinc oxide (ZnO). This material has the characteristics 
of: low cost, non-toxicity and easiness of synthesis [22]. It is also environmentally friendly and abundant in the nature [23]. The ZnO has been 
combined with graphene for flexible SC applications: Rai et al. [24] 
employed a ZnO/rGO composite as electrode for SCs. The specific 
capacitance and energy obtained for this material was 345 F/g, and 7.66 
Wh/kg, respectively. The composite also showed a capacitance retention 
of 87% after 1000 charging/discharging cycles. Additionally, Subramani et al. [25] synthesized a similar ZnO/rGO composite and this 
showed a specific capacitance of 203 F/g and high capacitance retention 
of 98% after 10,000 cycles of charge/discharge. In addition, Kasap et al. 
[26] presented a supercapacitor fabricated of graphene foam and zinc 
oxide electrodes. They obtained a maximum capacitance of 448 F/g and 
energy density of 35 Wh/kg. Another investigation by Rajeswari et al. 
[27] studied a graphene/ZnO composite electrode for SC applications 
and produced a capacitance value of 719 F/g (no results of energy 
density or capacitance retention were reported). From these works, we 
can infer that the overall capacitance increases after adding ZnO to the 
electrodes, but the energy density is still low (<35 Wh/kg). Thus, the 
combination (synergy) of ZnO + graphene should be improved to 
enhance the energy density in the graphene based SCs. 
On the other hand, there is a serious problem of pollution by plastics/ 
microplastics in lakes, and oceans [28,29]. The Global plastics production has continuously incremented since 1950s. It is estimated that 359 
million tons of plastics were produced only in 2018, and it is expected to 
increase around 33–36% by 2050 [30]. Particularly, polypropylene (PP) 
is the second plastic most produced in the world after the polyethylene 
(PE) and it is widely used to make labels for disposable plastic bottles 
made of PET (polyethylene terephthalate), which are employed for 
beverages such as sodas, water and fruit juices [31,32]. Those labels are 
rarely recycled and are disposed together with the PET bottles. After 
their disposal, they are collected and transported to the municipal 
garbage dumps, where most of them are buried underground. Consequently, the PP in the labels and the PET of the bottles become a source 
of contamination for the lands, rivers, oceans etc. As an effort to reuse 
the soda labels and to make low cost supercapacitors, we designed in this 
research a flexible supercapacitor using recycled soda labels as support 
of graphene based electrodes. Those labels are suitable to make the SC 
electrodes because they are flexible, lightweight and can be recovered 
from the waste by tons, which make them a low cost component for the 
SCs. The SCs made with the recycled soda labels (taken from the PET 
bottles) can be folded (like a napking paper) and wrinkles are formed on 
their encapsulation (external structure) without affecting drastically 
their electrochemical performance. In fact, the devices can be unfolded 
and they recover their original “flat” state. Solid state SCs with those last 
characteristics have not been reported previously to the best of our 
knowledge. We should emphasize that only a few works were found 
about wrinkled graphene based electrodes for SC applications: The first 
one by Zang et al. [33] reported graphene based electrodes with microwrinkled architecture and those ones produced a maximum capacitance 
of 258 F/g and a maximum energy density of 30 Wh/kg when they are 
stretched from 0 to 300% strain. The solid state SCs made with the 
wrinkled graphene based electrode was stretchable and exhibited a low 
capacitance of 20–53 F/g. A second work by Jang et al. [34] studied a 
wrinkled 3D foam on PDMS for SC applications. This one was coated by 
a conductive ink to study its capacitive properties, but the authors only 
demonstrated an increase of capacitance by 8.3 times when the wrinkled 
graphene electrode is stretched up to 50% and its capacitance retention 
was 95% after 100 stretching cycles (at 50% strain). However, no values 
of specific capacitance and energy density were found in this last article. 
Due to the scarcity of works about foldable solid state SCs able to be 
wrinkled, we decided to work on this type of devices and tried to find a 
low cost architecture and components to make it. First, we fabricated 
two conductive electrodes by printing graphene ink on recycled soda 
labels (which can be wrinkled manually). Next, we coated them with "
276_Intro.txt,"In order to make up for the shortcomings of a lack of fuel
resources and make the aim of energy conservation and
emission reduction come true, developing new energy has been
the irreversible trend of Times.1−4 It is against such a backdrop
that the development of safe, environmentally friendly, and
sustainable new types of energy storage devices is essential.
Due to its large energy density and high working voltage, the
lithium−ion battery (LIB) is widely used in industry,
aerospace, mobile communications, and other fields.5 Unfortunately, the frequency of incidents, resulting from internal
short circuit and local severe warming of LIBs in electric
vehicles, has increased in recent years, which has caused
irreparable damage and loss. In contrast, aqueous supercapacitors (SCs) can eliminate the risk of flames resulting from
organic and poisonous electrolytes used in LIBs.6 In addition,
SCs can experience long cycle life and quick charging and
discharging processes, which is just what LIBs do not have.7−11
Therefore, SCs are one of the most promising energy storage
systems for the future.12,13
Common cathode materials for asymmetric supercapacitors
(ASCs) can be divided into three categories: carbonous
materials, conductive polymers, and transition metal oxides.
Compared with carbon materials with low capacitance and
insoluble organic conductive polymers in water, transition
metal oxides are the most promising in production because of
their characteristic of multivalency and variety.12,14−16 Therefore, manganese dioxide (MnO2) stands out as an indifferent
oxide, which endows MnO2 with the property of acid/alkali resistance, and works well in acidic/alkaline/neutral electrolytes. Meanwhile, the seven electrons in the extranuclear
electron shell of MnO2 provide the potential of multivalence
states, such as 0, +2, +3, +4, +6, and +7, which have the
abundant possibility of mutual conversion between different
valence states.17−19 The redox reaction can provide more
charge than the carbonaceous material that is dependent on
adsorption and desorption to store charge, obtaining a higher
capacitance. Besides, the advantages of low cost, large reserves,
environmental friendliness, and so on make manganese dioxide
different from the general transition metal oxides, which has
attracted extensive attention and research.4,7,20 However, every
coin has two sides. Manganese dioxide is limited by poor
electrical conductivity, resulting in unsatisfactory rate capability
under high current. Because of that, the large-scale application
of manganese dioxide has been difficult to promote. Therefore,
the development of MnO2 with high conductivity and excellent
performance is still a great challenge.
Until now, many endeavors have been devoted to improving
the conductivity of MnO2, and one of the most commonly
used methods is to introduce heteroatoms into the crystal
structure of the host material to produce oxygen vacancies. For
example, Lu21 et al. obtained nitrogen-doped MnO2 through
low-temperature NH3 calcination, and Peng22 et al. developed
nitrogen-doped MnO2 through high-temperature nitrogen
calcination. Except for that, the pyrolysis of an N-involved
precursor23 and hydrazine hydrate treatment24 can realize
nitrogen element doping as well. Nevertheless, the methods
mentioned above need either dangerous reagents or strict
experimental conditions and a complex process, bringing
additional difficulties to material preparation. Therefore,
developing a facile and safe nitrogen-doping strategy for
MnO2 is essential.
As far as the authors know, there is no report on nitrogendoped manganese dioxide via an ammonia hydrothermal
treatment. Moreover, the available reports of nitrogen-doped
MnO2 are mainly focused on the fields of catalysis and aqueous
zinc ion batteries (ZIBs), rather than SCs. In this work, dense
MnO2 nanosheets are deposited on the NGCF substrate in a
positive potential window, and then nitrogen-doped manganese dioxide (N−MnO2/NGCF) composite electrode
material with an oxygen vacancy is obtained by hydrothermal
treatment in a small amount of ammonia. Nitrogen doping
replaces the original part of lattice oxygen atoms by the
corresponding nitrogen atoms, resulting in lattice mismatch
because of the difference in atom radius between the nitrogen
atom and oxygen atom, which produce a large amount of
oxygen vacancies. As a result, more oxygen vacancies function
as active sites, which shorten the electron/ion diffusion path
and speed up the electron/ion transport, making the
improvement of conductivity a reality. In addition, hydrothermal condition to nitrogen promotes the expansion of the
originally curled nanosheets to obtain a larger effective active
area, which ensures full contact between the material and
electrolyte and further enhances the buffer capacity of the
containing electrolyte with additional capacity obtained. The
N−MnO2/NGCF cathode shows excellent electrochemical
performance, obtains a high reversible mass specific
capacitance of 358.4 F g−1 at 1 A g−1
, and remains 185.1 F
g−1 at a large current density of 30 A g−1
. At an amount of
10 000 experienced charge−discharge circuits at 5 A g−1
, the
capacitance retention is 125% compared with the original
capacitance, manifesting a long cycling life. A symmetry-like
configuration for the asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) in this
work is MnO2/NGCF as the anode and N−MnO2/NGCF as
the cathode. The ASC achieved a maximum energy density of
75.3 Wh kg−1 at 598.9 W kg−1 and maximum power density of
18.12 × 103 W kg−1 with 26.7 Wh kg−1
. After undergoing
10 000 cycles of charge−discharge at 5 A g−1
, 88% of the
capacitance retention can be retained, exhibiting excellent
cyclic stability. In addition, the working mechanism of N−
MnO2/NGCF is investigated through ex situ XRD and SEM,
and it is proven that N−MnO2/NGCF irreversible phase
transformation and deformation exist during the charging and
discharging process. In brief, N−MnO2/NGCF experienced
irreversible phase transformation from MnO2 to MnOOH due
to H+ intercalated in the first discharge process, where it is
MnOOH that actually works as the active material during the
cycle life rather than MnO2. In addition, there are also
reversible phase transformations of buserite and reversible
precipitation/dissolution of hausmannite during the charging
and discharging process. On the contrary, MnO2/NGCF
maintains the same phase and morphology regardless of
charging or discharging. What has never been mentioned
before is that nitrogen doping not only promotes the
electrochemical performance but also brings a strong
probability of phase transformation. This work sheds light on
exploring the mechanism of nitrogen doping on MnO2 and
helps the development of high-performance MnO2, which
serves as a cathode material for supercapacitor systems"
277_Intro.txt,"Supercapacitors possess the advantages of excellent energy efficiency, fast charge/discharge rate, safe operability, low maintenance, 
and long cycle life, making them promising candidates as the new energy storage devices for modern electronic devices and various smart 
devices [1–3]. However, the relatively low energy density of the carbon 
material-based supercapacitors limits their applications. Recently, researchers have paid great attention to the pseudocapacitive materials, 
which could provide higher specific capacities by exploiting reversible 
interfacial redox reactions than the carbon-based materials working by 
electrostatic charge adsorption mechanisms [4,5]. Unfortunately, these 
pseudocapacitive materials are susceptible to poor cycling stability, 
inferior rate capabilities, and volume expansion due to their dependence 
on surface Faraday redox reactions and slow reaction kinetics [6–8]. It is 
imperative to design new pseudocapacitive electrode materials for 
supercapacitors to address these issues [9]. One of the ways is to develop 
effective strategies to accurately grow mesoporous structures of the 
pseudocapacitive electrode that facilitate ion transport, increase 
electrode-electrolyte interfacial area, and alleviate volume expansion 
during the charging/discharging cycles [10–12]. Another way is the 
establishment of 3D nanostructures. Compared with 2D nanosheet, 
polyhedral morphology and.etc, 3D nanostructure tends to strengthen 
its mechanical structure stability and possesses more stable 
microstructures. 
Up to now, considerable researches have focused on the binary 
transition metal oxide pseudocapacitive material NiCo2O4 because of its 
excellent electrochemical performance and electronic conductivity [13]. 
Researchers found that NiCo2O4 has lower impedance characteristics 
than nickel oxide and cobalt oxide [14–16] as the nickel cobaltite promotes surface redox reactions [17]. More importantly, the multiple 
electronic states and various nanostructures in NiCo2O4 can also offer 
more charge for the redox reactions carried out by spinel cobaltite with 
spinel structure [18]. Chu et al. reported that nickel sulfide (Ni–S) 
electrodeposition on NiCo2O4 (NiCo2O4@Ni–S) nanoplate arrays formed 
a graded hierarchical NiCo2O4@NiS functional material, which would 
provide a specific capacitance of 1.85 F cm− 2 at 8 mA cm− 2 [19]. In 
addition, Wang and co-workers synthesized the NiCo2O4@CoMoO4 
nanowire/nanoplate arrays. The capacitance of this material can reach 
14.67 F cm− 2 at 10 mA cm− 2
, while decreasing by 25.9% after 1000 
cycles [20]. The capacity and cycle stability of the NiCo2O4 
based-electrodes are still far from the expectation due to their low 
conductivity and insufficient concentration of active sites [21]. As a 
powerful technology, Phosphate-doping has been applied to increase the 
oxygen vacancies in NiCo2O4, which could modulate the electronic 
structure, increase the charge loading, boost electronic conductivity, 
and improve the electrochemical performance of NiCo2O4 [22,23]. Besides, the introduction of phosphate ion increases the bond length and 
lowers the electronegativity, and finally weakens the attraction of Ni2+, 
Ni3+, Co2+ or Co3+ to 3d electrons [24]. As a result, the energy of 
electron transmission in NiCo2O4 reduces in the redox reactions, thus 
significantly improving the surface reactivity and reaction kinetics [25]. 
Based on the above considerations, we designed and synthesized a 
3D multi-layered sea urchin-like P–NiCo2O4 nanostructure with oxygenrich vacancies through a defect engineering approach. In terms of 
structure, compared with 2D nanosheet, polyhedral morphology and. 
etc, 3D multi-layered sea urchin-like structure retains a large amount of 
space between neighboring structures, which greatly enlarges the specific surface area and provides a large volume of 3D continuous electron 
transport channels for electrolyte ion accumulation by acting as an ion 
reservoir. Meanwhile, we introduced Nitrogen/Phosphorus elements 
(N/P) into the P–NiCo2O4 lattice to generate Co/Ni–P and Co/Ni–N 
bonds, so as to generate more oxygen vacancies. The oxygen vacancies 
can modulate the electron structures to obtain good physical and electrochemical properties, weaken the charge transfer resistance and increase the active sites, accordingly boosting the surface reactivity and 
reaction kinetics. In addition, Density-functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the formed edge defects by phosphate-doping can 
effectively tune the electronic structure of NiCo2O4. The P–NiCo2O4 
shows a higher charge density near the Fermi level, which provides more 
charge carriers for the redox reactions and promotes the adsorption/ 
diffusion of OH− in the electrolyte. Besides, the calcination temperature 
and the mass of NaH2PO2 are controlled to maximize the operating 
performance of electrodes. The optimized P–NiCo2O4 shows a superior 
specific capacitance of 467 C g− 1 at the current density of 1 A g− 1 and 
excellent capacitance retention of 87.2% after 10,000 cycles at 20 A g− 1
. 
Furthermore, the assembled asymmetric supercapacitors using 
P–NiCo2O4 cathode and active carbon (AC) anode demonstrate longterm cycling durability and a high energy density of 31.25 Wh kg− 1 at 
the power density of 7500 W kg− 1
, which is especially crucial for the 
practical application of electronics. 
2. Experimental section 
2.1. Synthesis of sea-urchin-like P–NiCo2O4 
In the typical synthesis, 1.5 mmol Ni(NO3)2•6H2O, 1.5 mmol Co 
(NO3)2•6H2O and 1.44 g urea were dissolved in a mixture of 40 mL 
deionized water and 40 mL ethanol under violent stirring. Then, the 
obtained solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel 
autoclave and heated at 90 ◦C for 9 h. After cooling to room temperature, the precursor was collected by centrifugation and washed several 
times with deionized water and ethanol, respectively, then dried overnight at 60 ◦C. The products were denoted as NiCo-precursor. 
To prepare P–NiCo2O4, 0.05 g NiCo-precursor and 0.5 g NaH2PO2 
were put at two separate porcelain boats and then placed in a tubular 
furnace (NaH2PO2 at the upstream side of the furnace). Under N2 atmosphere, the furnace was heated to 300 ◦C (heating speed of 2 ◦C 
min− 1
) and remained at 300 ◦C for 2 h. After naturally cooling to 
ambient temperature, the products were denoted as P–NiCo2O4. 
2.2. Synthesis of NiCo2O4 
The NiCo-precursor was annealed under the air atmosphere at 300 ◦C 
for 2 h to obtain NiCo2O4. The products were denoted as NiCo2O4. 
2.3. Material characterizations 
The morphology of the samples was characterized by a field-emission 
scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOLJSM-6700F) and a transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Titan G260-300 with a probe 
corrector). The elemental mapping images of the materials were 
measured via FESEM equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) mapping. X-ray diffraction (XRD, PHI 5000 Versa Probe), Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Kratos AXIS-ULTRA DLD-600 W) 
and Raman spectrometry (LabRAM HR JYEvolution, 532 nm) were 
carried out to characterize the crystal structure and chemical compositions of the samples. N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were performed at 77 K with a Quantachrome Autosorb AS-6B system with 
degassed samples. BET and BJH methods were used to calculate the 
specific surface area and pore size distribution based on the N2 
adsorption data. 
2.4. Electrochemical measurements 
The electrochemical tests were carried out by a CHI 600E (Chenhua 
Shanghai, China) electrochemical workstation. The working electrodes 
were made with 80 wt % of the P–NiCo2O4, 10 wt % of acetylene black, 
and 10 wt % of Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF). The well-mixed slurry 
was coated on nickel foam with an area of 1 cm × 1 cm, dried at 80 ◦C for 
12 h, and then pressed under 10 MPa for 10 s. For the three-electrode 
measurements, the P–NiCo2O4 or NiCo2O4 electrode was the working electrode with Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode and a Pt foil as the 
counter electrode in 2 M KOH aqueous solution. To assemble the 
asymmetric supercapacitors, a P–NiCo2O4 electrode and an AC electrode 
were sandwiched between a filter paper (thickness of 25 μm, NKKTF4425) using 2 M KOH aqueous solution as the electrolyte. 
The specific capacitances (Cs, C g− 1
) of the electrodes are calculated 
based on their galvanostatic charge/discharge curves, according to the 
following equation (1): 
Cs = IdischargeΔTdischarge

The energy density (E, Wh kg− 1

where m is the mass loading of each electrode (g), ΔT is the discharging 
time in one cycle (s), C is the specific capacitance (F g− 1

potential window (V). 
2.5. Computational method 
Spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) simulations were 
performed by the Materials Studio using the projector augmented wave 
(PAW) potentials with a plane wave cutoff at 489.8 eV. The generalized 
gradient approximation (GGA) of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) 
functional was employed in our simulations. The NiCo2O4 was modeled 
by a 1 × 1 × 1 hexagonal cell. The P–NiCo2O4 model was built by 
replacing two oxygen atoms with Nitrogen atom and Phosphorus atom 
to simulate based on the experimental observations. The k-point meshes 
of both NiCo2O4 and P–NiCo2O4 models were 2 × 2 × 2 for the geometry 
optimizations and the DOS calculations. The energy and force convergence criteria were set at 10− 5 eV and 0.03 eV Å− 1
, respectively."

A plethora of merits qualified supercapacitors (SCs) as leading
candidates for high-performance next-generation energy
storage devices.1−4 While the energy density of SCs is
relatively lower than that of battery devices, asymmetric SC
(A-SC) and hybrid SC (H-SC) configurations were purposed
to bridge such an energy density gap.5−7 However, there are
many debates in the literature concerning the definition of ASCs and H-SCs.8,9 The A-SC is a device with either two
electrodes made of the same material and different mass
loadings or two electrodes made of different materials, namely,
capacitive and pseudocapacitive, based on their way to store
ions/charges.8,9 In contrast, the H-SC is the term used when
the device contains one battery-like electrode material.8,10 To
this end, the studies targeting high-performance A-SCs and HSCs are mainly focused on the improvement of the anode
materials, with little attention devoted to developing negative
electrode materials.11−14 The inefficient performance of either
the positive or negative electrode will restrict the full tapped
capacitance of the device, limiting the overall device performance.13−15 Noteworthily, more efforts should be directed
toward the synthesis and development of functional negative
electrode materials.6,13
Niobium oxides have been recognized as effective functional
materials in solar cells and photocatalysis.16−18 Recently,
niobium oxides have shown great promise as positive electrode
materials for battery and SC applications.19−23 Yet, few studies
have reported their performance as negative electrodes.
Specifically, niobium pentoxide (Nb2O5) is the most common
oxide with favored electrochemical properties.21,24 Interestingly, it has a quite complex structure and exhibits many
polymorphisms; about 15 polymorphic arrangements of Nb2O5
have been reported so far.21 However, orthorhombic (TNb2O5), pseudohexagonal (TT-Nb2O5), monoclinic (HNb2O5), and tetragonal (M-Nb2O5) polymorphisms are the
most frequent phases, and each of them has its unique ion
storage features.21,25,26 Among them, T-Nb2O5 has a high
theoretical capacitance (360 F/g) with pseudocapacitive
characteristics.21,22 For example, the T-Nb2O5 nanoparticle
anode was shown to exhibit the highest power performance
compared to other counterparts.27 Moreover, the T-Nb2O5
and M-Nb2O5 phases showed outstanding stability as cathode electrodes, unlike the monoclinic and pseudohexagonal
phases.25 However, facile and simpler methods to fabricate
T-Nb2O5 are needed rather than the common surfactantassisted hydrothermal method.20 To this end, electrochemical
anodization has a myriad of favorable characteristics such as
speediness, simplicity, and the possibility of materials nanostructuring at ambient temperature.17,28 In addition, it is a
practical and sustainable approach that can be deployed on a
large scale.17,28 Eventually, to mitigate the issue of poor
conductivity of Nb2O5 (∼3 × 10−6 S cm−1
), which is crucial
for the best performance in practice, the alloying strategy, in
general, and, with Zr metal, in particular, were shown to boost
the material’s conductivity.17,22 Similarly, defect engineering
represents a leading protocol in tailoring the band structure
and tuning the material’s intrinsic electronic conductivity. The
defect engineering approach was proved effective in photoelectrochemical hydrogen production systems.17,28 Thus far,
this strategy has also been demonstrated in many other
electrochemical applications including SCs to manipulate the
reaction thermodynamics and kinetics.29−31 Therefore, the
fabrication of thin (sub-100 nm), defective, one-dimensional
(1D) metal oxide films is expected to facilitate ion diffusion
and resist the mechanical degradation of the electrodes.20
However, these structures are usually fabricated using
lithography techniques, which are expensive and require
special processing in a cleanroom environment with the need
to design special masks. These requirements make it less
accessible in a plethora of labs.32,33 Herein, a feasible
experimental design was investigated for the lithography-free
fabrication of sub-100 nm, binder-free T-Nb2O5 with a 1D
nanotubular framework on the Nb-6Zr substrate as an efficient
negative electrode in SC devices. In this regard, the impact of
annealing in both reducing and oxidizing atmospheres on the
performance of the material has been disclosed. The defective
T-Nb2O5 (H-NbZr), produced via controlled annealing in a
H2 atmosphere, showed the best capacitive performance. The
existence of Nb4+ species (NbO2) surged the pseudo-Faradaic
storage mechanism. The SC device assembled of nitrogendoped activated carbon (positive electrode) and the defective
NbZr (negative electrode) revealed a quite high areal
capacitance of 1.7 mF/cm2 at 1 mA/cm2
. Besides, the device
maintained 93% of its initial capacitance over 1000 successive
galvanic charge/discharge (GCDs) cycles under harsh
conditions.
■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
Materials Synthesis. Negative Electrode Preparation. A pure
niobium-zirconium alloy with 6% Zr and a purity of 99.8% (Firmetal
Co., Ltd) was mechanically polished and cleaned by ultrasonication in
acetone, ethanol, and deionized water for about 10 min each,
respectively. Electrochemical anodization was carried out in a twoelectrode setup connected to a DC power supply [Agilent (E3612A)],
in which the Nb-Zr foil was the positive electrode and the graphite
rod was the negative electrode. The anodization solution entailed
ethylene glycol and fixed amounts of dist. H2O (6 vol %) and 0.74 M
ammonium fluoride (Chem-Lab, 99%). Electrodes with a fixed area of
1 cm2 were anodized for 30 min at 50 V. Subsequently, the anodized
samples were washed with distilled water and then left over to dry.
Afterward, the nanotube samples were moved to a tube furnace
(Thermo Scientific LINDBURG/BLUE M TF55030C), where the
samples were annealed in either air or H2 atmospheres. The annealing
conditions were 400 °C for 40 min with ramping (heating and
cooling) 1 °C/min. For the H-NbZr samples, the flow rate was
adjusted to 100 sccm. The choice of annealing temperature was
displayed according to the careful optimization as per our previous
study.17 The air and hydrogen-annealed films will be termed as ANbZr and H-NbZr, respectively.
Positive Electrode Preparation. The nitrogen-doped activated
carbon (XFNANO, 7440-44-0, purity 95%) and polyvinylidene
fluoride were mixed in dimethylformamide in the mass ratio of 9/1
and stirred overnight until the ink became homogenous. Later, the ink
was micro-pipetted above the conductive graphite sheet current
collector, then transferred to the oven, and left to dry at 80 °C for 24
h. The geometric active surface area per electrode was adjusted to 1
cm2
.
Device Fabrication. To reveal the real functionality of the novel
electronically defective sub-100 nm H-NbZr film, it has been
assembled with nitrogen-doped activated carbon (N-AC) as the
positive electrode in an asymmetric device, namely, N-AC//H-NbZr.
The electrochemical performance of the asymmetric device was tested
in a 1 M H2SO4 aqueous electrolyte, where a wetted separator was
placed between the two assembled electrodes Materials Characterization. The morphology and the topology
of the synthesized samples were characterized using a high-resolution
Zeiss Ultra 60 field-emission scanning electron microscope and JEM2100 high-resolution transmission electron microscope. As for the
composition and structure of the fabricated thin films, X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Al Kα source, hν = 1486.7 eV)
was used. The crystal structures were elucidated using a PANanalytical X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα1 radiation (λ = 0.154 nm).
The 2θ range was 20−80° (step size of 0.01°) with a glancing angle of
0.5°. A Shimadzu UV−vis diffuse reflectance spectrometer over the
wavelength range of 200−800 nm was utilized to determine the band
gap energy as an indication of the material’s conductivity. Electron
spin resonance (ESR) measurements were probed at room temperature using Klystron-X-band frequencies (9.5 GHz) as an electromagnetic radiation source. Raman spectroscopy was performed using
an excitation laser beam of λ = 532 nm. For more details on

280_intro.txt,"Energy storage devices with fast storage mechanisms,
high energy density, power density, longer life cycle,
and environmentally friendly aspects are coming in
demand rapidly [1, 2]. Rechargeable batteries and
supercapacitors are highly promising candidates to
fulfill all these properties but batteries suffer from
poor power density as compared to supercapacitors
[3–5]. Supercapacitors have the potential of highpower density, longer life cycle, and good electrochemical performance, but suffer from poor energy
density. The energy density and other parameters of
supercapacitor could be enhanced by developing the
novel material, composites, doping, and via increasing the potential voltage, specific capacitance, ionic
conductivity of electrolyte, etc. [6–9]. Recently, perovskite oxide materials exhibited potential toward
energy storage applications, like batteries, supercapacitor, solar cell, and solid oxide fuel cell [10–12].
The various applications of perovskite materials are
illustrated in scheme 1. Perovskite oxides materials
with general formula ABO3 show high conductivity
with varying oxidation states at both A and B sites
and good stability at high temperature [13]. Here, A
site is occupied by alkali earth elements/rare earth
(large ionic radii with 12-fold coordinate) and B site is
occupied by generally transition metals (small ionic
radii with sixfold coordinate) [14–16]. At A site, rare
earth element (lanthanum) is prominent candidate
due to its inimitable electronic configuration
‘‘4f
n1
5d01
6s
2 (n = 1–15)’’ with combination of Ni/
Co/Mn transition metals at B site, shows the
remarkable properties, i.e., magnetic, electrical, catalytic, optical, and electrochemical, such as batteries,
supercapacitor, and fuel cell [17]. The conventional
supercapacitor follows the electric double-layer
(EDL) process to store the charge, which shows low
energy density as compared to new type of storage
process, pseudocapacitance that follows three different types of storage mechanism [18]. The first mechanism is electrosorption valency, the process of
adsorption of ions from electrolyte on the electrode
surface, second mechanism follows the reduction and
oxidation reaction at the surface of electrode and
electrolyte, and third mechanism involves the ions
intercalation process in the electrode material [16].
Recently, Mefford et al. investigated that oxygen ions
play an important role as a charge carrier during
electrochemical reaction in aqueous electrolyte entitled as anion-intercalated supercapacitor [16]. Highly

281_intro.txt,"Energy storage devices with fast storage mechanisms,
high energy density, power density, longer life cycle,
and environmentally friendly aspects are coming in
demand rapidly [1, 2]. Rechargeable batteries and
supercapacitors are highly promising candidates to
fulfill all these properties but batteries suffer from
poor power density as compared to supercapacitors
[3–5]. Supercapacitors have the potential of highpower density, longer life cycle, and good electrochemical performance, but suffer from poor energy
density. The energy density and other parameters of
supercapacitor could be enhanced by developing the
novel material, composites, doping, and via increasing the potential voltage, specific capacitance, ionic
conductivity of electrolyte, etc. [6–9]. Recently, perovskite oxide materials exhibited potential toward
energy storage applications, like batteries, supercapacitor, solar cell, and solid oxide fuel cell [10–12].
The various applications of perovskite materials are
illustrated in scheme 1. Perovskite oxides materials
with general formula ABO3 show high conductivity
with varying oxidation states at both A and B sites
and good stability at high temperature [13]. Here, A
site is occupied by alkali earth elements/rare earth
(large ionic radii with 12-fold coordinate) and B site is
occupied by generally transition metals (small ionic
radii with sixfold coordinate) [14–16]. At A site, rare

remarkable properties, i.e., magnetic, electrical, catalytic, optical, and electrochemical, such as batteries,

supercapacitor follows the electric double-layer
(EDL) process to store the charge, which shows low
energy density as compared to new type of storage
process, pseudocapacitance that follows three different types of storage mechanism [18]. The first mechanism is electrosorption valency, the process of
adsorption of ions from electrolyte on the electrode
surface, second mechanism follows the reduction and
oxidation reaction at the surface of electrode and
electrolyte, and third mechanism involves the ions
intercalation process in the electrode material [16].
Recently, Mefford et al. investigated that oxygen ions
play an important role as a charge carrier during
electrochemical reaction in aqueous electrolyte entitled as anion-intercalated supercapacitor [16]. Highly

282_intro.txt,"Nowadays, approximately 85% of the electric energy consumed in 
houses, buildings and industry is produced by burning fossil fuels, but 
this releases greenhouse gases that cause drastic environmental 
changes such as droughts, flooding, forest fires and storms in places 
where they are not normally observed [1,2]. For this reason, the development of renewable energy sources that are innocuous for the 
environment are necessary. Currently, Li ion batteries (LIBs) serve as 
an energy source for tablets, smartphones, electric vehicles etc. due to 
their high energy density (30–200 Wh/Kg), low power density 
(<1000 W/Kg), high cyclic stability (>500 h) and long discharge times 
(3–10 h) [3]. Particularly, Lithium Sulfur (Li-S) batteries are very 
promising due to their high theoretical energy density and abundance 
of sulfur in the nature [4]. These can produce high capacities when 
they are made with cathode electrodes containing carbon materials 
such as activated carbon textiles (ACT) or graphene derivatives: B4Cnanowires/ACT/S/reduced-graphene-oxide (≈500 mAh/g) [5] and 
ACT@Fe/Fe3C/S (≈764 mAh/g) [6]. In fact, sustainable and eco-friendly 
Li-S batteries have been fabricated by using activated carbon, which is 
obtained from biomass materials such as: recycled paper hardboard 
(1016 mAh/g) [7], recycled paper (1083.1 mAh/g) [8], cotton textile (1016–1710 mAh/g) [9,10], and yeast fermented wheat (450 mAh/g) 
[11]. Despite the high capacity presented by the Li-S batteries, their 
performance to operate for long times is still limited by the fact that 
whiskers (or a crust layer) are formed on the Li electrode, which block 
the charge transfer and leads to the battery failure [12]. This last 
problem should be eliminated in order to produce Li-S batteries at 
mass scale in the market and therefore, researchers worldwide are 
working for this purpose. 
On the other hand, supercapacitors bridge the gap between 
secondary ion batteries and conventional dielectric capacitors, offering high power density (~196 kW/Kg), high cyclic stability 
(> 500,000 h) and low discharge time (seconds to minutes), but their 
low energy density (< 20 Wh/Kg) is limiting their use for the portable applications mentioned above [2,13]. Since the supercapacitors 
(SCs) have a simpler architecture, compact size and faster fabrication 
time than the LIBs, the scientific community is doing enormous efforts to make supercapacitors with longer discharge times. If 
this goal is reached, they could be used to feed portable medical 
equipment, wearable sensors and portable OLEDs among others 
devices [14,15]. 
In order to enhance the electrochemical performance of SCs, 
nanostructured materials with high surface area, high porosity, high 
electrical conductivity, and high content of active sites (for redox 
reactions) have been incorporated in the electrodes of the SCs 
[2,14,16,18]. Carbon-based materials such as graphene, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and activated carbon are widely employed as electrodes for SCs [16–19]. Particularly, the graphene stands out among 
these carbon compounds due to its larger specific surface area 
(1000–3000 m2
/g), tunable surface chemistry, high electrical conductivity, high mechanical properties (1–9 TPa), and high theoretical 
capacitance of 550 F/g [16–20]. On the other hand, the transition 
metal oxides (TMOs) are the best electrode materials for redox 
pseudocapacitors because they generally possess several oxidation 
states and are relatively conductive [21]. The most popular TMOs are 
MnO2, Ni(OH)2 and RuO2, because they have very high theoretical 
capacitances of 2085, 1400 and 905 F/g [4,16,20,21], respectively. 
Due to their high capacitance, these oxides have been combined 
with graphene to make efficient flexible solid state supercapacitors: 
For example, Ma et al. [22] reported the use of MnO2 nanorods/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as positive electrode and MoO3 nanorods/rGO as negative electrode in the solid state SCs. As a result, 
they obtained a high operating voltage of 1.6 V while delivering an 
energy density of 18.2 mWh/cm3 at a power density of 76.4 mW/ 
cm3
. Moreover, Li et al. [23] reported a flexible MnO2/graphene 
composite paper that produced a maximum capacitance of 256 F/g 
(at 0.5 A/g) and capacitance retention of 78% after 1000 cycles of 
charge/discharge. Another work by Xu et al. [24] developed a conductive graphene/activated-carbon/MnO2 composite film which 
produced a maximum capacitance of 123 F/g and capacitance retention of 82.8% after 10,000 cycles of charge/discharge. Additionally, Lan et al. [25], reported the use of a Ag/Ni(OH)2/3Dgraphene composite as potential electrode for SCs because it produced a maximum capacitance of 2167 F/g and a high capacitance 
retention of 98% over 1000 cycles of charge/discharge. Finally, Cho 
et al. [26] fabricated bendable RuO2/graphene composites and found 
a maximum capacitance of 1561 F/g and capacitance retention of 
92% and 82% for the unbent and bent states, respectively, after 500 
cycles of charge/discharge. Although these flexible electrodes/devices have demonstrated capacitive properties in general, they still 
are not robust and soft enough to be used on textiles, lining, clothes 
or plastic supports. In addition, these flexible graphene electrodes/ 
devices have still very short discharge times (< 20 min), which make 
them impractical for portable applications where the charge should 
be supplied for long times. 
Apart from the high capacitance and flexibility, the supercapacitors should be soft, wearable, light and washable in order to 
fulfill the requirements for the forefront applications that are being 
created for the future military and medical market such as wearable 
sensors (for monitoring the heart rate, blood oxygen etc.), wearable 
chargers for cell phones and wearable IR emitting lighting sources 
for night vision. Thus, these state of the art applications demand 
efforts to develop flexible and lightweight SCs on carbon based 
textiles/fabric/fibers: Gao et al. [27] fabricated all-solid-state asymmetric SCs with the configuration of (NiCo2O4/Carbon-clothes// 
Porous-graphene-papers), which produced a maximum capacitance 
and energy density of 71.32 F/g and 60.9 Wh/kg, respectively. Those 
devices also exhibited a high capacitance retention of 96.8% after 
5000 bending cycles. Hybrid MnO2/Zn2SnO4/Carbon-microfibers 
hybrid composite have been also synthesized and exhibited a capacitance of 642.3 F/g (at 1 A/g), energy density of 36.8 Wh/kg and 
98.2% after 1000 cycles of charge/discharge [28]. Furthermore, the 
cotton fabric has taken a relevant role in textile supercapacitors, 
since it is widely used for this purpose: Li et al. [29] assembled SCs 
with electrodes of cotton-fabric/rGO. The devices produced a maximum capacitance and energy density of 464 F/g (at 0.25 A/g) and 
27.05 Wh/kg, respectively. They also had good cycling stability of 
91.6% after 1000 cycles of charge/discharge. Another supercapacitor 
device was fabricated using as electrode a cotton textile coated by 
MnO2/SWCNT/polyaniline, which stored charge redox reactions and 
generated a maximum capacitance and energy density of 294 F/g 
and 66.4 Wh/kg [30], respectively. This device also had a capacitance 
retention > 70% and > 97% when subjected to 1000 cycles of charge/ 
discharge and to a bending angle of 180°, respectively. Furthermore, 
Gao et al. [31] grew a hierarchical nanostructure of NiCo2O4@ 
NiCo2O4 (core/shell) on flexible cotton active carbon textiles and 
used them as anode electrodes in symmetric SCs, which reached a 
maximum capacitance of 1929 F/g and energy density of 83.6 Wh/ 
kg, respectively. In particular, these SCs showed a capacitance retention above 88% after 1000 cycles of charge/discharge at the unbent, bent or twisted states. Li et al. [32] reported rGO-coated cotton 
fabric as electrodes of SCs and obtained a maximum capacitance of 
464 F/g (at 0.25 A/g), energy density of 27.9 Wh/kg and a capacitance 
retention of 91.6% after 1000 charge/discharge cycles. Another work 
by Costa et al. [33] studied efficient textile SCs made with electrodes 
of cotton-fabrics/CNTs of industrial grade. The devices exhibited a 
low specific capacitance of 8 F/g, energy density of 6.2 Wh/kg and a 
capacitance retention of 96.3% after 5000 cycles of charge/discharge. 
Moreover, the work of Hu et al. [34] demonstrated that highly conductive textiles (125 S/cm) can be produced by depositing a SWCNTs 
ink on cotton/PET. The devices fabricated with these electrodes exhibited a maximum capacitance of 140 F/g (at 20 μA/cm2
), energy 
density of 20 Wh/Kg and a capacitance retention above 97% retention after 40,000 cycles of charge/discharge. Additionally, Bao et al. 
[35] demonstrated that the cotton T-shirts can be converted to activated carbon textiles (ACT) and this can be used to make a MnO2/ 
ACT composite, which produces a maximum capacitance of 269.5 F/g 
(at 2 mV/s) and energy density of 66.7 Wh/kg while maintaining a 
high capacitance retention of 97.5% after 1000 cycles of charge/discharge. Similarly, Co-Al layered double hydroxides have been combined simultaneously with the ACT and graphene to produce textile 
SCs with a capacitance of 145.8 F/g, energy density of 55.04 Wh/kg 
and capacitance retention of 87.54% (calculated after 2000 cycles of 
charge/discharge) [36]. If the ACT is combined with the CoO and 
graphene to make asymmetric cells with the configuration core/shell 
CoO@NiO/ACT//ACT/graphene, a maximum capacitance of 147.6 F/g, 
energy density of 52.26 Wh/kg and capacitance retention of 97.53% 
(after 2000 cycles of charge discharge) are obtained [37]. As observed, the textile supercapacitors have in general a high cyclic 
stability and moderate capacitance but they still present some issues 
such as: i) limited window for the operating voltage (0.0–1 V), ii) low 
energy density (< 100 Wh/kg), iii) their electrodes are fabricated 
with complex and time consuming methods such as combined dry-coating/reduction, dipping and dip-pad-dry methods and iv) 
their electrodes combines graphene or CNTs with ternary composites which need long synthesis times. 
In order to overcome the problems of the current textile supercapacitors mentioned above and to enhance their electrochemical 
performance, we designed in this work flexible and soft supercapacitors using cotton as substrate/support. Basically, we deposited 
a graphene ink on the cotton textile using the bar coating method 
and employed the cotton-textile+graphene as the conductive electrode. Additionally, we decorated one of the electrodes (anode) with 
NiO:Yb microparticles (YbNi MPs) to increase the capacitive performance of the textile SCs. The Yb dopant was selected because it 
has +2 and +3 valence states that act as redox centers for the charge 
storage by redox reactions. In fact, previous reports have demonstrated that composites of Yb2O3/graphene can reach capacitances 
up to 550 F/g (at a scan rate of 3 mV/s) due to the reversible redox 
reactions of Yb3+/Yb2+ [38]. NiO has been selected as the host matrix 
because it has a high theoretical capacitance of 2584 F/g, easiness of 
synthesis and high redox activity from Ni2+ to Ni3+ and viceversa 
[39,40]. In addition, it can produce outstanding capacitances of 
1100–1500 F/g when combined with carbon materials such as graphene and CNTs [41,42]. To the best of our knowledge, the YbNi 
microparticles have not been employed in textile supercapacitors 
previously. One of the main novelties of this work is the fact that we 
studied the performance of the textile devices using a biodegradable 
rice paper and recycled dishwasher sponge as separators instead of 
the conventional fabric, celgard 2501 or PVA/KOH polymer gels 
previously reported. This benefits the environment because part of 
the textile supercapacitor can be naturally biodegraded (the rice 
paper) and we also used a “soft” waste (dishwasher sponge) consumed by tons worldwide, reducing the contamination of the soil 
and oceans by plastics. In fact, high capacitances have been produced 
using activated carbon derived from sustainable and low cost materials such as egg shells (420.8 F/g at 0.5 A/g) [43] and banana peel 
(161.1 F/g at 0.25 A/g) [44]. Other carbon materials derived from 
biomass such as yeast cells, bamboo waste, watermelon among 
others can produce capacitances in the range of 100–380 F/g [45]. In 
general, our results indicate that the maximum capacitance values 
were 640.6 and 1153.1 F/g for the devices made with rice paper and 
sponge as separators, respectively. Those values of capacitance are 
the highest reported so far for textile SCs to the best of our knowledge. More importantly, we studied the performance of the devices 
when they are subjected to a pressure of 500 g/cm2 or when they are 
bent (those conditions are close to the real ones if they are used on 
clothes). Hence, the results presented here demonstrate that the 
textile supercapacitors are good candidates to be used on wearable 
applications. "
283_intro.txt,"Supercapacitors have been widely investigated owing to the 
merits of high specific capacitance, high power density, long cycle 
life, fast charge-discharge process and low cost [1–6]. Supercapacitors are a new type of energy storage device different from 
traditional capacitors and rechargeable batteries. According to the 
storage mechanism, supercapacitors can be divided into electrochemical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) and pseudo-capacitors. 
Pseudo-capacitors have attracted more attention for higher energy 
density and specific capacitance compared with EDLCs [7]. Transition metal oxide/hydroxide, such as Co3O4, MnO2, SnO2 Co(OH)2, and 
Ni(OH)2 as pseudo-capacitors material has been widely investigated 
for the traits of low cost and special electronic structure [8]. Especially, Co(OH)2 has aroused much interest for the reason of rich in 
content, non-toxic and high theoretical specific capacitance (about 
3460 F g−1) [9]. For instance, the Co(OH)2-MoSe2 nanosheets as 
electrode material prepared by Alamet al. [10] displayed a high 
specific capacity of 541.55 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. 
However, the inherent structural instability [11], aggregation problem and inferior electrical conductivity lead to their poor electrochemical capability in practical application [10]. 
Doping is an effective way to enhance the electrode materials’ 
specific capacitance by providing high electronic conductivity and 
forming the synergistic effects of multiple metal species [12,13]. 
Therefore, adding Sn as a heteroatom, coexisting with the element of 
Co can effectively improve its electrochemical performance. Simultaneously, the introduction of defects is also a useful and facile 
method to boost the material electrochemical performance. Oxygen 
vacancy defects as an electron donor can increase the electron 
conductivity [14–16] and the redox activity, which are beneficial to 
improve the specific capacitance. For example, oxygen-vacancy-rich 
nickel-cobalt layered double hydroxide had been reported by Liang’s 
groups [15] with the specific capacitance of 1563.1 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. 
Furthermore, Feng et al. [12] revealed oxygen vacancies can enhance 
the supercapacitors’ performance of CuCo2O4, and CuCo2O4 exhibits 
a remarkable specific capacitance of 1006 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. In addition 
to these methods, controlling the morphologies of material is also a 
commonly used route to improve electrochemical performance [17]. 
Two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets have been aroused much attention for the reason of large interlayer spacing and short diffusion 
length [18]. The above-mentioned characteristics of the 2D materiHere, tin cobalt bi-metal and dual ligand Co(OH)2/SnOᵪ/C was fabricated by easy one-step hydrothermal method, synthesized the hybrid 
nanosheets with multivalent metal oxide/hydroxide and oxygen vacancies. The Co(OH)2/SnOᵪ/C exhibits a special flower-shaped consisting 
of nanosheets as a petal. The oxygen vacancies can elevate the material 
conductivity, and benefit from the rich oxygen vacancy with unique 
structure, Co(OH)2/SnOᵪ/C possesses a high specific capacitance of 
806.36 F g−1 at the current density of 1 A g−1. Furthermore, the solidstate asymmetric supercapacitor assembled with the Co(OH)2/SnOᵪ/C 
shows an energy density of 49.73 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 
1599.98 W kg−1 as well as long cycle stability of 64.43% capacitance 
retention after 20,000 cycles. Therefore, Co(OH)2/SnOᵪ/C could be a 
potential electrode material"
284_intro.txt,"Supercapacitors (SCs) have been recognized as high-efficiency
electrical energy storage devices due to their excellent rate
capability, long cycle life, and ultrahigh power density.1,2
However, the development of SCs is limited by the lack of stable
electrode materials to realize higher energy/power densities
along with long-cycling lifespan.3–5 Transition metal oxides,
such as Fe2O3, Co3O4, Ni(OH)2, Mn3O4 and MnO2, have been
extensively studied due to their pseudocapacitive charge storage
mechanism with high capacitance.6–9 In particular, Mn3O4
emerged as a promising candidate with appealing features of
high abundance, environmental benignity and high theoretical
specic capacitance.3,6 However, its practical utilization is
greatly restricted by the sluggish charge transfer kinetics and
poor cycling performance.10,11
In recent years, various strategies, such as integrating with
a conductive carbon matrix,5,12–14 reducing particle sizes and
fabricating porous networks have been utilizedfor enhancing
the charge transfer kinetics of the Mn3O4 electrode.15–18 Nonetheless, most of these studies only focused on facilitating the
electronic or ionic transport kinetics of Mn3O4 separately. To
fully explore the performance of Mn3O4, it is necessary to
improve simultaneously the electron and solid-state ionic
transfer kinetics. Furthermore, due to the Jahn–Teller distortions and the resulting lattice stress, Mn-based oxides suffer
from unsatisfactory long-term cycling stability in aqueous
electrolytes.19 Although several strategies, such as interfacial
orbital regulation, valence engineering, cationic disordering,
and cation vacancies, have been adopted to improve the cycling
stability,20–22 there is still room for further improvements in the
cycling performance of Mn3O4. Therefore, it is highly desirable
to elaborately design Mn3O4 electrode materials for achieving
high capacity and rate capability with stable cycling performance.23–25 Recently, a structural distortion strategy was reported to facilitate charge transfer,26 improve the conductivity
and enhance the redox activity of electrode materials.27,28
Although some advances have been achieved, it should be noted
that rapid ionic transfer kinetics in Mn3O4 is still hindered by
the remarkable contraction of the c-axis interlayer spacing with
a limited c-axis parameter in the Mn3O4 lattice.29–31 Therefore, it is highly desirable to stretch the c-axis in the Mn3O4 lattice to
boost the charge transfer kinetics with broadened c-axis ion
transfer channels, providing a new structure design concept to
optimize the energy storage performance.
Herein, Mn3O4 with c-axis stretched lattice distortion was
successfully synthesized via a simple sulfurization/
desulfurization treatment. The achieved Mn3O4 with c-axis
stretched lattice distortion (oxygen vacancy, Ov-Mn3O4)
possesses delocalized electron conguration, signicantly
accelerating the electron transfer. The c-axis stretched lattice
distortion with broadened ion transfer channels can effectively
reduce the ionic diffusion energy barrier, facilitating Na+
transport kinetics. Also, a prolonged cycle life of Ov-Mn3O4 was
achieved due to the suppression and accommodation of cooperative Jahn–Teller distortion. As a result, the resultant OvMn3O4 exhibits a high Na+ storage capacity of 331.1 F g1 at

, an improved rate performance of 258.2 F g1 at 20 A g1

and a prolonged cycling life with a capacity retention of 83%

Inorganic porous materials display interesting physical properties, such as magnetic, heterogeneous catalysis, adsorption/
separation, and ion-exchange due to their diverse composition
of metal ions and unique porous structure.[1–9] Among them,
porous transition-metal phosphates have been attracting wide
attention in renewable energy conversion and storage
technology,[2,3] such as supercapacitors,[10,11] metal-air batteries,
especially, hydrogen energy from water splitting.[2,12–16] However, the overpotential at 10 mA/cm2 for oxygen evolution
reaction (OER) in the process of water splitting, corresponding
to 10% solar-to-fuel conversion efficiency, is still significantly
higher than the standard potential of ~1.23 V because it
involves multiple proton-coupled electron transfers (PCET)
process, leading to its sluggish kinetics. Many electrocatalysts
such as metal-based oxysalts: oxides/hydroxides,[8] phosphates
and borates,[2,3] especially, porous transition-metal phosphates
with H2PO4- or  HPO4
2- unique proton acceptors, have shown
superb electrocatalytic performance toward OER in local pH
environment, thus, they have been widely used as promising
candidates owing to their various metal coordination configuration and structural stability.[12] However, despite many
advantages, there are still disadvantages needed to be over come, such as their poor electronic conductivity and insufficient electroactive sites. Therefore, it is much more appealing
to develop facile and effective strategies to obtain earthabundant phosphates alternatives to the state-of-art precious
group metal-based electrocatalysts, thereby directly reducing
costs and improving the water splitting efficiency. Among
these currently reported strategies, the heteroatom doping
into the electrocatalysts is proven for boosting electrocatalytic
performance[17–30] including cationic doping (such as Fe, Ni,
Co)[2,17,18] and anionic doping (such as N, C, F, P and S)[19–31]
because they could regulate the electronic structure, improve
electrical conductivity, bringing in rich-defects and increase
their active sites, above all, the aliovalent anion substitution
could optimize the adsorption of intermediates, thus, driving
high current-density at low overpotential and enhancing their
electrocatalytic performance. For example, Huang et al
reported N-doped carbon shelled bimetallic phosphates higher electroactive sites, mass transfer and ion diffusion,
resulting in superb OER activity. Therefore, it plays an
important role to construct porous transition metal phosphates with heteroatom doping as highly efficient OER
electrocatalysts. Herein, we fabricated a mesoporous monometallic Co-based phosphate with oxygen vacancies by in-situ
transformation of a Co-phosphate material, namely,
NH4Co3(HPO4)2(H2PO4)F2 with NH4
+ cations and F anions.[36]
Further, we investigated OER performance of the preparedmaterials; what is more, the reversible reaction of transitionmetal phosphate materials as pseudocapacitors is similar to
the initialized reaction steps of OER in the alkaline
system,[11,37–39] thus, the obtained material was also used as the
electrode materials of supercapacitors. Firstly, the transitionmetal phosphate materials were annealed under N2 atmosphere at different temperature, finally, the optimal N, F codoped monometallic Co-based phosphate with rich oxygen
vacancies shows a remarkable boost in OER performance with
lower overpotential of 276 mV at the current density of
10 mAcm 2 and smaller Tafel slope of 57.11 mVdec 1 on
glassy carbon, compared with its pristine material (347 mV
and 76.25 mVdec respectively), besides, it has excellent
long-term durability, keeping 92% of the initial current density
after electrocatalytic oxygen production for 35 h. Furthermore,
the optimal material applied as supercapacitor displays
206.3 Fg and maintains cycling stability with 80%
after 3000 cycles. Thus, this study provides a facile, environmentally-friendly, and attractive strategy to discover advanced
metallic phosphates with superior electrochemical performance for energy conversion catalysts and energy storage.

286_intro.txt,"Over the past few decades, the demand for energy usage
has been rapidly increasing; therefore, the need for a more highly efficient, low-cost energy storage is vital [1–5]. Electrochemical supercapacitors, as a bridge between battery
and traditional capacitor, have garnered researchers’ attention and are considered part of emerging technology [6,
7]. Supercapacitors have fast charge/discharge rate, a high
power density, and a good cyclic stability, which can be
used in heavy electric vehicles and consumer electronic
devices, industrial power management, and military devices
[8–10]. The charge storage mechanism of supercapacitors
is associated with electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs)
and pseudocapacitors [11]. The EDLCs are based on the
charge separation at the electrode-electrolyte interface in
high surface area materials, while the pseudocapacitors
relied on the reversible faradaic redox reaction of active
species on the electrode surface [12]. The synergic interaction between the electrode and electrolyte needs to be improved in order to ultimately enhance the supercapacitors.
The specific capacitance of an active material depends on
the number of active sites and how easy it is to access by
the ions of the electrolyte. The number of active sites is
determined by the integrity of the lattice and the numbers
of oxygen vacancies [13]. In addition, it increases markedly
with the decreasing dimensions of metal oxide crystals [14]. Surface area affects the electrochemical performance;
therefore, many works focus on increasing surface area or
making porous nanostructure to improve the performances
[15, 16]. Although nanosized perovskite oxides with ABO3,
where the A and B sites have the ability to aliovalently
substitute ions with varying oxidation states, have been
widely investigated for various applications such as catalysts [17, 18], novel memory [19], and solid oxide fuel cells
[20], there is still more research needed to study the charge
storage in perovskite-structured materials. Currently, various nanosized materials, e.g., transition metal oxides [21,
22], carbon-base materials [23–26], conducting polymers
[27], and their derivatives [28] are primarily used as a super
capacitor electrode. Despite, the metal oxides having poor
conductivity, they are typically considered as ideal electrode
materials due to their higher energy density than carbon
materials, better stability than conducting polymers, and
large specific pseudocapacitance due to multi-electron transfer during the faradaic reactions [29]. Among the various
perovskite metal oxide materials [30–35], SrMnO3 (SMO)
has been rarely reported for supercapacitors so far. To our
knowledge, only pure and doped SMO nanofibers have
demonstrated as a supercapacitor electrode [15]. Even though
the high specific capacitance was achieved, the production process was extremely complicated, which increases its
cost. In order to be ready for a cost-effective and large-scale
supercapacitor manufacture, a simple, active material fabrication should be implemented. In this study, we provide the
very first report of the sized dependence on electrochemical
properties of SMO particles prepared by a simple solid-state
method. Then, the size of as-prepared particles was reduced
by a simple high-energy ball milling process, which is
ready to implement for large-scale production. The designed
supercapacitor electrodes with both as-prepared and nanosized SMO particles have some interesting behaviors after
numbers of charge/discharge cycles. Cumulatively, these
outstanding features make both sizes of SMO prepared by
a simple method a highly promising electrode material for
various types of power source. These could also pave a way
for a large-scale production for supercapacitors."
287_intro.txt,"The shortage of energy and the contamination of living
environment raised from the unrestrained economic
activities of human beings have become the two key
obstacles to the sustainable extension of the living environment on earth.1 In recent decades, many new technologies have emerged through the efforts of scientists,especially the rising stars in energy systems that point the
way to a brighter future.2,3 That is renewable energy
sources have become a new model to satisfy the energy
demands of our society.4-6 Therefore, efficient storage
and conversion technologies are the top priority for the
practical application of renewable energy in consequence
of the intermittent property. Among many energy-storage
patterns, electrochemical capacitors are peculiar charge
storage apparatuses, which possessed many superiorities
like high power density, durable cyclic property, and
quick-acting charging. Unfortunately, the inferior energy
density of supercapacitors hinders its further popularization and application when compared with secondary batteries.7 Is there a material that has a preferable energy
density while sacrificing a lower power density? The most
likely answer to that question today is pseudocapacitive
materials.8
Ni-containing materials, have superhigh specific
capacitance theoretically, easily prepared and abundant
on earth, have been intensively explored as electrode
materials for supercapacitors, which expected to substitute the scarce ruthenium oxide.9 Up to now, nickelbased materials used in electrode materials for supercapacitors mainly include nickel-containing oxides,10
hydroxides,11 sulfides,12 phosphates13 and selenides,14
etc. Unfortunately, the pristine above nickel-based materials more or less have deficiencies like inferior conductivity, narrow potential window, and mediocre cyclic
durability. To eliminate the aforementioned shortcomings, various attempts have been undertaken. Methods
such as improving the specific surface area of materials,15
decoration and incorporation with carbonaceous
materials,16,17 preparing nickel-containing compounds of
bimetal or ternary metals,18 nickel-containing organic
frame structures19 and doping of non-metallic elements20
have been reported to have positive effects on nickelbased supercapacitors.
A great deal of recent works have reported that the
intervention of oxygen vacancy could improve the charge
storage capacity of electrode materials.21 For instance, Liu
et al fabricated the oxygen-deficient bismuth oxide (rBi2O3/GN) by treating fresh Bi2O3/GN in sodium borohydride water solution, which exhibited more excellent performance than Bi2O3/GN in supercapacitors.22 Sun et al
reported a Fe2O3-δ nanorod array with oxygen-deficient
prepared by a facile and controllable method, which have
about a double capacitance when compared to the conventional Fe2O3-δ nanorods.23 Based on the analysis to the literature, the introduction of oxygen vacancies can
efficiently change the donor densities of materials, improve
the kinetics of the surface redox reactions, produce impurity states in its bandgap and consequently increase its
charge storage.24,25 Although many nickel-based materials
have been reported for supercapacitors electrode, the work
of nickel-vanadium bimetal chloride hydrate for electrode
materials of supercapacitors has not been reported.
Based on the above analyses of nickel-based capacitor
materials and oxygen vacancy, in this work, we prepared
nickel/vanadium chloride hydrate by a simple in situ
growth method. In addition, the synthesis conditions were
optimized to obtain the electrode materials with the best
specific capacity and cyclic stability by controlling the concentration of NaCl. Consequently, the prepared NVC-1.8Ov
electrode presents a specific capacitance of 9.41 F cm−2 at a
current of 10 mA cm−2
, which approximately 1.5 times
than the NVC electrode, and retained 75.7% of its original
capacitance after 5000 charge-discharge cycles. Furthermore, an asymmetric supercapacitor prepared with NVC1.8Ov cathode and AC anode, which shows a maximum
cell voltage of 1.7 V with a high areal capacitance of
1.175 F cm−2 at 10 mA cm−2
, and acceptability cycle stability of 69.0% retention after 5000 cycles. Surprisingly, the
NVC-1.8Ov//AC supercapacitor presents a highest energy
density of 0.471 mWh cm−2 under a high power density of
9.319 mW cm−2
. This work proposed a simple method of
preparing electrode materials for high stability supercapacitors and proved that the vacancy introduction could
accelerate the performance of supercapacitor materials. "
288_intro.txt,"With the continuous depletion of fossil fuels, as well as the
increasing global environmental pollution problems, the
demand for renewable energy or new energy technology is
becoming more and more urgent.1–4 Since the rapidly progressive development of human society urgently requires efficient,
clean and sustainable energy, many researchers have tried to
explore new techniques for energy conversion and storage.
Nowadays, it is well known that capacitors and batteries are two
of the most common energy storage devices, although the
relatively low energy density of capacitors and the low power
density of batteries, frequently limit their practical applications.5–8 Supercapacitors are potential candidates for energy
storage devices, which have the potential to compensate for the
gap between traditional capacitors and rechargeable batteries
by virtue of their unique advantages such as high power density
and energy density, long cycle life, safety and environmental
friendliness.9–11 As such, there is no doubt that the
supercapacitor will become one of the most promising energy
storage devices in the near future, and it is worth mentioning
that the key to improving the electrochemical performance of
the supercapacitor is to develop a high-powered electrode
material.
In recent years, MoS2 nanomaterials, especially MoS2 nanosheets, have been considered among the most promising electrode materials for supercapacitors due to their great surface
hydrophilicity and high electrical conductivity.12–14 However,
MoS2 nanosheets, with single- or few-layers, which have abundant active sites located at the exposed edges, are quite unstable
and agglomerate easily. They are not conducive to electron
transfer among different layers that are connected by van der
Waals forces so that in pure multilayer MoS2 nanosheets, the
free electrons have to hop through each layer to reach to the
active edge sites, which results in a much higher electron
resistance, thus greatly weakening the electrochemical performance.14–17 Therefore, it is a necessary but challenging task to
achieve stable prepared MoS2 nanomaterials via a suitable
synthetic method. As discussed in previous works,18–24 to obtain
edge-exposed ultra-thin MoS2 nanosheets, the growth of the
MoS2 nanosheets is limited to the surface of TiO2 nanorods
(TNr). As a substrate for the nucleation and growth of the MoS2
nanosheets, TNr with abundant anatase nanoparticles generated on the surface effectively inhibited the agglomeration of
the MoS2 nanosheets. Since the one-dimensional (1D) nanorod
structure is highly ordered, it is benecial for the transmission of electrons because the electrons can selectively transfer along
the one-dimensional nanorods due to the quantum connement in the transverse direction, and simultaneously shorten
the transport distance of the electrolyte ions.25 The TiO2 nanostructure also exhibited good stability in electrochemical reactions other than the substrate function, which greatly improved
the stability of the MoS2/TiO2 composites and effectually
promoted the sustainable utilization of electrode materials.26–28
Considering that the MoS2@TNr composites exhibit excellent piezoelectric catalytic degradation performance, and fully
extend the utilization of materials in practical application, the
electrochemical properties of the recycled MoS2@TNr catalyst
for supercapacitor testing were further explored in this study.
On the one hand, the reuse of the abandoned catalysts collected
aer the piezoelectric catalytic degradation process for the
typical energy storage devices could largely eliminate secondary
pollution of the natural environment. On the other hand, the
reclaimed catalyst serving as a potential electrode material for
energy storage may benecially promote the development of
renewable energy technology, as well as decrease the energy
consumption to some extent. Hence, the MoS2@TNr composite
is expected to act as an excellent multifunctional material to
solve both the environmental pollution and energy shortage

289_intro.txt,"Supercapacitors (S.C.s) have received extensive attention 
due to its high power density, specifc capacitance, fast 
charge–discharge rate and high stability. The storage and 
release of electrical energy are according to the electrostatic 
interaction between ions and electrodes in the electrolyte 
[1–5]. Cobalt oxide (Co3O4) is a potential candidate for a 
pseudocapacitor electrode material because of its features 
such as environmentally friendly, low cost, and outstanding 
theoretical specifc capacity up to 3560 F g−1. However, the 
rate capability and cycle ability of pure Co3O4 electrodes are 
hindered owning to poor conductivity. A promising strategy 
is to provide high specifc capacitance and generate new 
electron routes by introducing high conductive materials 
[6–9].
To date, extensive eforts are available for growing or 
anchoring Co3O4 onto graphene (Gr) with particular morphology or architecture to accelerate electron/ion migration, enhance electron transfer performance and improve 
its specific capacitance by shorting the distance of ion 
difusion and change the inner surface state [10–13]. For 
example, Yang et  al. presented the ultrafine Co3O4/Gr 
composites exhibit excellent S.C. performance by a onestep laser irradiation method. The specifc capacitance of 
978.1 F g−1 (135.8 mAh g−1) was obtained at the current 
density of 1 A g−1, with the current density up to 10 A g−1, 
and the highest capacitance retention of 916.5  F  g−1
(127.3 mAh g−1) was obtained [14]. Divyapriya et al. [15] 
synthesized reduced graphene oxide/cobalt oxide (rGO/
Co3O4) composite material and investigated a potential cathode for hybrid capacitive deionization (HCDI) systems. The cyclic voltammetry studies indicated that the rGO/Co3O4
electrode exhibited high specifc capacitance (210 F g−1
at 5 mV s−1) with redox properties. And it presents a significantly high ion removal capacity of 18.63  mg  g−1
(250 mg L−1, 1.6 V), which is 2.8 times higher than pure 
rGO-based CDI system. Lin et al. [16] used the in situ 
growth of Co-based zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF67) polyhedra in the presence of graphene oxide followed 
by thermal annealing to fabricated rGO/Co3O4 composites. 
The as-fabricated symmetrical supercapacitor based on rGO/
Co3O4 exhibits a high specifc capacitance of 277.5 F g−1 at 
25 A g−1 and an energy density of 24.7 Wh kg−1 at a power 
density of up to 40 kW kg−1. To our knowledge, most of 
the excellent electrochemical properties of Co3O4/graphene 
composite supercapacitors are challenging to trace from the 
nanoscale efects of uniformly distributed Co3O4 particles 
with particle sizes less than 100 nm [14, 17–19]. It is precisely because of the vibrant reaction activity of Co3O4; on 
the fip side, the potential misgivings about the instability of 
the nanometer device in practical application are still lingering around at scholar’s mind arising from the possibility of 
the Co3O4 grain size growth or its chemical corrosion in the 
electrolyte. From this perspective, it is a benefcial exploration to investigate the supercapacitor behavior by adopting 
the large-size marketable Co3O4 particles with low cost and 
facilitate access. However, the necessary precondition is to 
develop a practical graphene encapsulation approach onto 
the large-sized Co3O4 particles to generate intimate contact 
between graphene and pseudocapacitive materials. Also, by 
summarizing available literature reports, creating the oxygen 
vacancies is considered as an efective strategy to enhance 
the conductivity and chemical activity of Co3O4 [20–22]. 
As far as we know, there is rarely a report about the fabrication of the large-sized spherical Co3O4/graphene core–shell 
heterogeneous composites by regulating oxygen vacancy for 
electrode materials in supercapacitors.
Herein, we proposed a novel graphene encapsulation 
which is fabricated by microwave plasma chemical vapor 
deposition (MPCVD) method to produce marketable 
large-sized (~ 10 μm) Co3O4/graphene (LCG) core–shell 
composites with abundant oxygen vacancy. In the lowpressure environment, the gas molecules are decomposed 
into charged free ions, free radicals and active groups. The 
active group was adsorbed on the surface of the powder 
substrate to fnd the lowest position of energy for deposition. The sedimentary layer on the base surface is continuously grown by a continuous supply of gas. Other products 
of the reaction and the incomplete reaction of the gas molecules are discharged with the vacuum pump. Graphene 
shell was deposited onto spherical Co3O4 particles by 
decomposing CH4 in the MPCVD route without introducing any complicated process or pollution additives. At the 
same time, abundant oxygen vacancies are created by the 
H2 plasma etching efect. Compared with the traditional 
method, the MPCVD method has the various advantages 
of lower cost, faster and much more straightforward operation. The specifc capacitance of the Co3O4/graphene 
core–shell heterogeneous composites reached 192.8 F g−1
at the current density of 0.5 A g−1.
Moreover, it has shown excellent cyclic stability after 
20,000 cycles, which revealed an over 98.5% capacitance 
retention at even 10 A g−1. Finally, the composite microstructure on how to afect the electrochemical performances was also discussed in detail. The innovation of 
our work confrms a new possibility for realizing highperformance S.C. electrodes by the utilization of largesized transition metal oxide, especially for high stability."
290_intro.txt,"Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is a versatile material [1] extensively
investigated in materials science due to its optical, electrical, and
electrochemical properties. The main characteristics that contributes to this is the varying geometries and morphologies [2–4] that
TiO2 can be obtained with high surface to volume ratios, which
enable it to be used in many fields such as photocatalysis [5], solar
cells [6], and electrochemical energy storage devices [7]. Among
those morphologies, the nanotubular one has been claimed to
promote a rapid charge carrier separation to hinder recombination
[8]. TiO2 nanotubes (TiO2-NTs) can be synthesized using different
techniques [3], such as hydrothermal and electrochemical. The last
one has the advantage to attain a self organized and aligned
material [9], without problems of adherence [10], in organic and
aqueous media at distinct bath compositions [11]. On the other
hand, the as-grown film has to be thermally treated to obtain the
desired anatase crystalline phase [12]. Aside the conventional
annealing method using the muffle furnace, some other nonconventional methods such as flame annealing [13], hydrothermal-thermal annealing [14], and microwave annealing [15–17]
have been reported. Among them, the use of a microwave oven is a
faster and simple method to convert the amorphous TiO2-NTs into
crystalline without any detrimental changes to the morphology or electrical properties [16]. This facile annealing method is based on
a hybrid heating [18] through the use of SiC, which promptly
absorbs microwave radiations and convert them to heat.
Presently, the main application of TiO2-NTs is focused on water
treatment or as anode material in electrochemical devices [1].
Concerning the latter application, films of TiO2-NTs have been used
as double layer supercapacitors (DLSC) [19–21], or in combination
with other metal oxides [7], mainly due to their high active area
[22]; however, high values of capacitance are only achieved when a
cathodic pre-treatment is carried out (other reduction processes
are also possible [23] using other metallic oxides, such as MoO3
[24]) before galvanostatic charge-discharge experiments. That
behavior, often referred to electrochemical doping, seems to be
related with generation of oxygen vacancies and Ti3+ sites in the
TiO2 film (resulting in the so called black TiO2) with a consequent
diminishment of the film resistivity [25,26]. In this respect,
however, only few works are concerned on how electrochemical
properties are affected by the generation of these species in the
TiO2 film as well as their stability on air or in solution. Oxygen
vacancies formed on the surface of TiO2 react readily with
adsorbed H2O leading to hydroxyl groups on its surface [27,28],
which can affect the electrocatalytic properties of TiO2 [29]. Lattice
disorder and generation of midgap states has been also reported
[30,31] to be associated with reduced TiO2 nanoparticles resulting
in high efficiencies for photocatalytic reactions [32]. In addition,
other important factors that are not often investigated in the
literature, such as the use of non-conventional annealing methods
(for the generation of the anatase phase), may have significant
influence on the structure and thus on the performance of reduced
TiO2-NT films as supercapacitor.
Thus, the aim of the present work is to compare the
morphological, structural and electrical properties of TiO2-NT
films, grown in organic medium and thermally treated using a
microwave oven and muffle furnace. The performance of
electrochemically reduced TiO2-NTs as DLSC using both annealing
methods to crystallize the TiO2 film have been investigated.
Furthermore, the influence of the thermally grown oxide over Ti
and the effect of long term stability during a water aging process of
TiO2-NT films, after a cathodic pre-treatment, have been investigated through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy."

292_intro.txt,"To cope with the approaching depletion of traditional fossil fuels, 
developing environmentally friendly and renewable energy storage 
equipment are necessary to solve the current world energy crisis [1,2]. 
Supercapacitors are promising next generation energy storage equipment, but its energy density needs to be further improved compared 
with traditional batteries, which is also an important factor limiting its 
development [3]. The performance of electrode materials is directly 
related to the characteristics of supercapacitors, so developing highcapacity electrode materials is the key to solve the above problems [4]. 
Transition metal oxides are intensively investigated as pseudocapacitive materials for their reversible redox reactions due to their low cost, 
abundant reserves, various valence states and high electrochemical activity [5,6]. Among them, NiCo bimetallic oxide has been widely studied 
as an electrode material because the extremely nearly ideal theoretical 
capacity [7]. However, its poor conductivity and slow ion mobility lead 
to poor rate performance, low Coulomb efficiency and rapidly decaying 
of cycle stability [8]. Recently, some researchers reported that the 
introduction of oxygen vacancies can change the electronic structure 
and chemical properties of NiCo bimetallic oxide. Thus, it may be 
effective to generate more active sites, optimize the electronic structure, 
and then improve the electrochemical performance [9,10]. Furthermore, vacancy engineering also can effectively increase the diffusion for 
charge carriers and OH– adsorption energy of the NiCo2O4 electrode 
during charge/discharge process [11]. Therefore, the presence of oxygen vacancies greatly extends its cycle life and has great prospects in 
energy storage. Such as Han’s group designed a simple hydrothermal 
method to prepare oxygen vacancy-containing metal oxide arrays 
(NixCo3-xO4/NF) by in situ oxidation [12]. The electrode displayed 
improved capacitance, impressive cyclic stability and rate performance 
compared to the sample without oxygen vacancy. 
The structure and morphology of the nanomaterial electrode are 
closely related to the electrochemical performance [13]. Metal organic 
frameworks have been applied to the field of electrochemistry due to 
their advantages of large specific surface area and porosity [14,15]. 
Among which, Prussian blue analogues (PBA) have a three-dimensional 
structure (3D) open framework, which has excellent electrochemical 
performance due to its adjustable composition and controllable structure [16,17]. PBA derivatives has been gradually applied in the field of 
supercapacitors due to its simple synthesis and special mixed valence 
state [18,19]. For example, Yoon et al. used a simple new bottom-up method to deposit copper hexacyanoferrate nanotubes on graphene 
oxide as a binder free electrode of the supercapacitor. The electrode can 
reach the highest energy density value of 54.37 Wh/kg under the power 
density of 200 W/kg [20]. According to the reports, combining with 
conductive carbon materials is also an effective method to enhance the 
conductivity of NiCo bimetallic oxide [21]. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) 
has high specific surface area, good conductivity, and stable chemical 
properties, it has been widely used as additive in electrode materials 
[22–24]. In addition, they are intertwined to form a conductive porous 
network structure, which can shorten the transmission path of electrons 
on the electrode and ions between the pores. [25,26]. However, there is 
no report on the preparation of oxygen enriched vacancy NiCo bimetallic oxide nanocage with PBA as precursor and the intercalation of 
carbon tubes to improve its conductivity. 
Herein, a method of in situ derivatization of PBA was developed to 
prepare carbon nanotubes incorporated oxygen vacancy NixCo1-xO 
nanocages. The NixCo1-xO nanocages with oxygen vacancy have hollow 
cavity, which is helpful for the rapid insertion and diffusion of ions and 
the absorption of OH–
. Combined with one-dimensional CNT, the overall 
conductivity has also been further improved. Therefore, the CNT/OVNixCo1-xO electrodes deliver an acceptable capacity of 1400.7 F g− 1 at 1 
A g− 1
. The hybrid supercapacitor constructed by CNT/OV-NixCo1-xO and 
activated carbon achieved a maximum energy density of 52.7 Wh kg− 1 
at a power density of 800 W kg− 1
. Furthermore, the device exhibited a 
capacity retention of 85.7 % over up to 10,000 charge/discharge cycles. 
Therefore, this provides a new idea for designing high-performance 
bimetallic oxide with nanocage structure electrode in supercapacitors."
293_intro.txt,"Several sustainable energy retentions and conversion technologies 
have been created in response to severe energy shortages and pollution. 
The growing need for energy has accelerated the growth of highperformance conversion and energy storage technologies [1–3]. However, there is a pressing need for reliable and efficient energy sources, 
such as batteries. [4], fuel cells [5], electronic devices [6], and supercapacitors (SCs) [7]. Among all supercapacitors are a type of energy

another term for supercapacitors and are categorized for example either 
as electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs) or pseudo capacitors 
grounded on their energy loading techniques. Over batteries and fuel 
cells, supercapacitors (SCs) have various advantages, including a high 
power density greater than 10 KW kg-1, rapid charge-discharge rate, a 
long life cycle, safety, and low maintenance costs [9]. Furthermore, 
unlike batteries, which are more temperature sensitive and may overheat or even catch fire when used at high temperatures, supercapacitors 
operate effectively throughout a broad variety of temperature ranges 
and emit no heat [10]. 
Electrocatalytic water splitting can create hydrogen, which has the 
potential to be used as a portable energy source and a substitute for 
current fossil fuels. Due to its high gravimetric density, hydrogen has 
long been recognised as a green energy source. The performance of the 
system as a whole was largely dependent on what happened at the anode 
and cathode [11]. Both OER on the anode and HER on the cathode are 
crucial half-cell processes in a electro catalytic splitting of water cell and both might benefit from the use of effective and affordable electrocatalysts [12].. The OER reaction is an important half-reaction, has 
also employed a lot of attention due to its number of advantageous [13]. 
OER is the anodic half-cell reaction and can be performed in both pH 
such as acidic conditions (0.5 M H2SO4) and in alkaline conditions (1 M 
KOH). Because OER reactions are time-consuming so, highly active 
electrocatalyst materials are essentially need to be developed. OER in 
acidic conditions can only be catalyzed with minimum overpotential by 
using Ir or Ru alloys, which are highly precious and expensive metals 
[14–19]. They are not viable for extremely large-scale synthesis of O2 at 
a reasonable price per unit volume because of their rarity and substantial related costs [20]. OER catalyzed by 3d transition metals and their 
oxides/hydroxides, is stronger and, also only viable under alkaline 
conditions. This is significant because just one active electrode material 
can be utilised for water splitting and energy storage systems [21–25]. 
The material science community has taken an interest in spinel 
structures because of their unique physicochemical characteristics. 
Nano-sized spinel is gaining appeal for usage in a number of industrial 
processes due to its fundamentally unique features, which are better 
understood as particle size approaches the atomic scale [26]. Redox 
activity is crucial for both energy storage and OER, ZnAl2O4 is an 
inexpensive, ecofriendly, and having high stability because of the 
number of oxidation states and synergistic effects [27]. Most bimetallic 
materials have low conductivity and insufficient active site concentrations owing to volume changes during electrochemical operations which 
would bound its applications [28]. The electrochemical and electrocatalytic, kinetics and activity processes can be considerably improved 
by molecular modifications to supercapacitor electrode materials and 
electrocatalysts, such as correct structural proposal [29] and 
transition-metal doping [30]. Porous [31], ultrathin sheet-like and 
needle-like [32] structures have more visible exterior and inner surfaces 
than big pure bulk metal oxides, and their atomic coordination number 
is lower. While appropriately doped atoms can cause structural deformation, this enhances the material’s capacity to store energy and 
accelerate reactions [33]. 
Furthermore, the above-mentioned issues have been solved by 
different transition metals such as Cr [34], Mn [35] and Fe [36] with 
doping strategies to increase the electrochemical performance of 
metallic oxide. It’s worth mentioning that there are a few more optimizations to be considered in this area first, because of their crystalline 
nature, these metal-incorporated ZnAl2O4 products lack the necessary 
overpotential and specific capacitance [37]. Materials made of amorphous transition metals have multiple active sites and pathways than 
crystalized transition metal-based materials. As a result, the metal 
dopant Mo may be a better option for ZnAl2O4 than other dopants. Mo 
dopants, a high-valence non-3D metal with advantages in terms of 
maximizing the free Gibbs energy (G) for electrochemical and electrocatalytic interphase production, have been shown to be desirable. Mo’s 
atomic structure is also ideal for doping since it is quite similar to that of 
Zn and Al. An amorphous molybdenum doped ZnAl2O4 with a 
cross-linked structure is required to combine all these advantages [38, 
39]. Furthermore, Surjit saho et al., developed the NiCo2O4 spinel for 
energy storage devices via hydrothermal route. The electrochemical 
result of NiCo2O4 exhibited the specific capacitance (Cs) of 823 F g− 1 
and specific energy of 28.51 Wh Kg− 1 at current density of 0.83 A g− 1 
[27]. Thirumala Rao et al., synthesized the ZnAl2O4 via hydrothermal 
approach for the supercapacitor application. The spinel ZnAl2O4 display 
the specific capacitance of 260.4 mAh g− 1 with columbic efficacy of 98% 
over 500 cycle [40]. Rebakah et al., manufactured the MnCo2O4 
anchored on the nanosheet of graphineoxide for water splitting reaction. 
The MnCO2O4 show low over potential of 250 mV to attained 10 mA 
cm− 2 current density and lower tafel slope of 78 mv dec− 1
. Huafeng shi 
et al., examined the Fe fabricated Ni, Mn Co2O4 via ions exchange route 
for OER. The fabricated electrode material shows 242 mV low overpotential to attained the10 mA cm− 2 current density under the alkaline 
media of 1.0 M (KOH). Li et al., developed the Mn doped CoCo2O4 for 
hydrothermal method for energy conversion devices. The electrochemical result depicted that the doped material displayed the specific 
capacitance of 668.54 F g− 1 [41]. X.L. Wang et al., fabricated the Cd 
doped ZnMn2O4 via hydrothermal method in order to use supercapacitors. The Cd fabricated products exhibited 346 F g− 1 at scan rate 
of 2 mV s
− 1 and EIS result suggest that the material show small Rct and 
straight line 45◦ indicate the good electrical conductivity [42]. Nirmalesh Naveen et al., developed and investigated the electrical properties 
of the Mn doped CoCo2O4 for supercapacitor application. The electrochemical result suggest that the 20% doped CoCo2O4 exhibited the 
larger specific capacitance of 440 F g− 1 among the other fabricated 
materials. However, overall electrochemical result also show the good 
agreement with the result of the GCD analysis [43]. 
In this study, a hydrothermal process followed by calcination is used 
to make Mo-doped ZnAl2O4 nanoparticles on carbon fiber (Mo–ZnAl2O4/CF). The morphological, structural and textural properties of 
fabricated electrode material was measured with X-ray diffraction 
studies, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Burnnauer Emmett 
Teller analysis (BET). The electrochemical performance was measured 
with the meterohm autolab and their electrochemical result suggest 
that, fabricated material exhibited the specific capacitance of 1477.63 F 
g− 1 and lower tafel slope of 38 mV dec− 1 and 255 mV over potential to 
reached 10 mA cm− 2 current density. Contrast to other transition metal 
complexes, the Mo–ZnAl2O4/CF porous, cross-linked network architecture is more favorable for electron transport. It is also possible to alter 
the volume variation of Mo–ZnAl2O4 while maintaining oxidative stability by forming an amorphous structure. Another astonishment was 
that Mo–ZnAl2O4/CF exhibited extraordinary long-term stability even 
during OER, when it experienced a fast self-reconstruction process that 
resulted in the formation of numerous rich oxygen space According to 
this research, Mo-dopants have the potential to transform metal oxides 
into cost effective, multifunctional materials of electrode for supercapacitors and OER electrocatalysts. "
294_intro.txt,"There is continued advocacy for green, low-carbon, controllable 
energy, such as wind, tidal, electrical, and other power sources [1–3]. 
One urgent problem is the effective storage of electricity. Among energy 
storage devices, supercapacitors are one type with high specific capacitance [4,5], high power density, long cycle life, and safe [6–9]. The 
electrochemical properties of supercapacitors are closely related to the 
performance of the electrode composition, and its preparation with 
improved performance is currently a key research area. Recently, many 
efforts have been made to develop high-performance (SC) electrode 
materials, including metal sulfides [10–12], transition metal phosphate 
[13], and transition metal hydroxide/oxide [14,15]. Transition metal 
oxides are environmentally friendly, have multi-valence states of constituent elements, and are widely used in the preparation process of 
electrode materials [16]. Co3O4 is a typical pseudocapacitance material 
with many oxidation states, low cost, and excellent theoretical specific 
capacitance (3560F g− 1
) [16–18]. However, its ion diffusion path is slow 
and electron transport poor, which results in reported capacitance 
values lower than theoretical and low capacitance retention [19]. 
Studies have attempted to improve the electrochemical properties of 
Co3O4 by using different synthesis methods, including doping with 
various elements [20–25], design of material morphology [26–29], and 
composite with other nanomaterials [30–34]. Additionally, studies have 
shown that the introduction of oxygen vacancies is an effective method 
to optimize the electronic structure, increase the number of active sites, 
and improve electrochemical performance [19,35]. First, during charge–discharge, oxygen vacancies can be used as electron carriers and 
active reaction sites to promote ion/electron transport and accelerate 
Faraday redox reactions. Second, the oxygen vacancy can change the 
morphology and chemical properties of the active electrode material 
without sacrificing structural stability. Finally, oxygen vacancies can 
cause atoms to establish an electric field which significantly improves 
electrochemical properties [36,37]. One example is ultra-thin Co3O4 
nanosheets (NSs) with rich oxygen vacancies that are fabricated on 
conductive carbon nanotubes (CNTs) using the chemical reagent NaBH4 
and high-capacitance multidimensional Ov-Co3O4 electrode materials 
prepared by phosphating treatment [26,38,39],
. However, it is still a 
challenge to adopt an effective method to accurately control the content 
of manufactured vacancies and optimize the electrochemical properties 
of materials efficiently. 
Due to the limited conductivity of Co3O4, the synthesized electrode 
material has tended to have relatively low energy density and poor cycle 
stability [40,41]. Sharma et al. [42] prepared MnO2/PPy nanocomposites by electrochemical co-deposition, which improved the redox 
properties of the nanocomposites and exhibited high capacitance and long redox cycle life. Wu et al. [43] synthesized PPy/MoO3 nanorod 
composites using a two-step method to significantly improve the electrochemical capacitive performance and cycling stability of the electrode materials. These results indicate that the composites significantly 
improve the electrochemical capacitive performance and cycling stability of electrode materials. These are attributed to the large surface 
area of the PPy nanoconductive layer and the synergistic effect and 
electronic conduction between PPy and transition metal oxide nanomaterials. Therefore, this approach may significantly improve the 
electrochemical properties of Co3O4 [44–46]. Nevertheless, composites 
consisting of oxygenated vacancies of metal oxide nanosheets and 
conductive polymers are rarely prepared. Therefore, it is important to 
develop oxygenated vacancy Co3O4/PPy nanocomposites. 
Based on these findings, Ov-Co3O4@PPy arrays on NF were fabricated. The addition of NaBH4 not only changed the morphology of 
Co3O4 but also reduced Co3+ to Co2+ to produce more oxygen vacancies, 
thereby improving its electrochemical properties. In addition, PPy, an 
excellent conductive polymer, improved the conductivity of the active 
substance and promoted the contact between the electrolyte and electrode material to improve the stability of the structure during the 
charge–discharge cycle. Compared with Co3O4 without NaBH4 treatment and electrodeposition PPy, the specific capacitance and cyclic 
retention rate of Ov-Co3O4@PPy nanocomposites showed a good rate 
performance, capacitance retention, and stability, which were attributed to the synergy between oxygen vacancy and PPy, indicating this 
method could improve the materials electrochemical properties."
295_intro.txt,"Supercapacitors (SCs) are expected to overcome the limitations 
of other conventional energy storage devices (e.g., batteries,fuel cells).[1–6]
 Based on the employed electrode materials and electrolytes during the 
construction of a SC, namely its storage 
mechanisms, a SC can be generally 
defined as an electrical double-layer capacitor (EDLC), a pseudocapacitor, or a hybrid 
capacitor.[7]
 An EDLC (e.g., made from 
carbon nanomaterials) is characterized by 
its stable capacitance and high power density, whereas a pseudocapacitor (e.g., made 
from transition metal oxides or MXenes) 
has its high capacitance and energy density, but suffers from a short lifetime. This 
is because a pseudocapacitive electrode 
involves faradaic or redox reaction(s) and 
meanwhile most of pseudocapacitive electrodes have poor structural stability and/
or low electrical conductivities. A hybrid 
capacitor is a combination of an EDLC 
and a pseudocapacitor. In general, it has 
two asymmetric electrodes. One electrode 
owns an electrical double layer capacitance 
and another one possesses a pseudocapacitance. Consequently, a hybrid capacitor 
overcomes the drawbacks of both an EDLC and a pseudocapacitor, featuring higher performance than an individual EDLC 
or pseudocapacitor. Recent growth of wearable energy storage 
devices has triggered rapid development of smart SC devices 
in that they (e.g., self-healable and self-powered devices) play 
significant roles in next-generation electronics for our modern 
society.[8,9]
 To fabricate these smart SC devices with high performance, the design and synthesis of novel SC electrodes, especially pseudocapacitive electrodes that possess high electrical 
conductivities, excellent pseudocapacitive behavior, long-term 
stability and/or high flexibility are thus of great significance.
Among various pseudocapacitive electrodes, transition metal 
carbides, nitrides and carbonitrides (MXenes) have been paid 
extreme attention recently for the fabrication of high-performance SC devices, stemming from their characteristics of 
high conductivities, big specific surface areas, notable pseudocapacitive behavior and unique clay properties.[10]
 MXenes 
are generally identified with a chemical formula of Mn+1XnTx
(n = 1, 2 or 3), where M is a transition metal, X is carbon/
nitrogen and Tx is a surface functional group (e.g., oxygen, 
fluorine, or hydroxyl).[10–12]
 In acidic electrolytes, MXenes have 
exhibited high pseudocapacitances, originating from their 
surface redox reactions. Such pseudocapacitive behavior is 
opposed to their ion-intercalation based pseudocapacitances in neutral and alkaline electrolytes. Unfortunately, the strong 
van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonding interactions 
between neighboring MXene layers result in the restacking of 
MXene nanosheets into thick structures. Thereby, the intrinsic 
characteristics of MXenes nanosheets are hindered in most 
cases and their unique pseudocapacitive properties cannot 
be fully revealed.[2,13,14]
 To prevent the restacking of MXenes 
nanosheets, they have been composited with other functional materials (e.g., conducting polymers,[15–17]
 carbon materials,[18–20]
 and metal oxides[21–24]
). These composites have 2- or 
3D architectures, providing highly accessible surfaces or big 
specific surface areas as well as sufficiently exposed active sites. 
As a result, redox reactions of MXenes nanosheets are boosted 
or their pseudocapacitive behavior can be further improved, 
eventually leading to enhanced SC performance of MXenes 
nanosheets (e.g., enlarged capacitances and energy densities).
In addition to MXenes, metal oxides (e.g., MoO3, MnO2, 
TiO2, RuOx, ZnO, and WO3) have been widely employed as 
pseudocapacitive electrode materials for the SC construction.[25]
Since electrical conductivities of most metal oxides are very low, 
they are frequently combined with other functional materials 
such as carbon nanomaterials (e.g., graphene). Due to the synergistic effects between metal oxides and the added functional 
materials, these composites exhibit improved capacitive performance, originating from enlarged pseudocapacitances of 
metal oxides as well as additional capacitances from the added 
functional materials.[26–29]
 Note here that physical synthesis of 
such composites might not be conductive to the formation of 
strong synergistic effects between metal oxides and the added 
functional materials. Among various binary/ternary metal 
oxides, tungsten oxides (WOx, 2 ≤ x ≤ 3) are the most promising pseudocapacitive electrode materials since they feature 
excellent intrinsic properties (e.g., environmental friendliness, 
outstanding electrochemical stability). Moreover, the presence 
of various crystalline phases and oxidation states inside tungsten oxides makes their fast redox reactions (or charging/
discharging processes) possible.[30]
 Starting from monoclinic 
WO3, W18O49 (also called WO2.72), one of the most studied 
non-stoichiometric tungsten oxides (WO3−x), can be synthesized. More importantly, it is the most stable phase of tungsten 
oxides in either acidic, alkaline, neutral, or organic media.[31]
Depending on the pH value of the used solution, the charge 
storage mechanisms of tungsten oxides are different. In acidic, 
neutral and organic solutions, tungsten oxides exhibit pseudocapacitive characteristics, whereas in alkaline electrolytes they 
display battery-like behavior.[30]
 Once the composites of tungsten oxides with other functional materials (e.g., graphene) are 
formed, electrical conductivities, specific areas and number of 
active sites of tungsten oxides can be further improved, finally 
leading to improved pseudocapacitive performance of tungsten 
oxides.[32]
 In these cases, tungsten oxides prevent restacking 
or aggregation of other nanomaterials, while the added nanomaterials act as the conductive templates to enhance electrical 
conductivities of tungsten oxides, ensure their charge transportation and eventually improve their pseudocapacitive behavior.
In this study, we design and synthesize pseudocapacitive electrodes using two pseudocapacitive materials: Ti3C2Tx
MXene nanosheets and W18O49 nanoflowers. Since both materials are negatively charged, the existing electrostatic repulsive 
forces between them are expected to reduce the restacking 
of MXene nanosheets as well as to prevent the aggregation 
of W18O49 nanoflowers. In this way, different oxidation states 
and/or active sites of two pseudocapacitive materials are fully 
exposed. Such W18O49/Ti3C2Tx MXene composites will then 
own superior pseudocapacitive properties to individual W18O49
nanoflowers and Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets. These composites are expected to even possess better pseudocapacitive performance than those of Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets or W18O49
nanoflowers with other non-pseudocapacitive nanomaterials 
such as graphene. This contribution reports the details of the 
design and synthesis of these W18O49/Ti3C2Tx MXene composites, their characterization by means of different microscopic 
and spectroscopic techniques, their pseudocapacitive behavior 
investigated by means of cyclic voltammetry and the galvanostatic charging/discharging (GCD) method, followed by the fabrication of quasi-solid-state asymmetric SC (ASC) devices using 
the W18O49/Ti3C2Tx MXene pseudocapacitive electrodes as the 
anode and an activated carbon (AC) cathode coupled with a 
redox electrolyte of FeBr3, the performance as well as the practical applications of these ASC devices. "
296_intro.txt,"Energy storage devices such as lithium-ion capacitors 
(LICs), sodium-ion capacitors (SICs), aqueous batteries 
and supercapacitor have found the limelight due to environmental friendliness, reliable safety and cost-efective [1–5]. 
In comparison, the SICs have the advantages in natural 
abundance, low cost and weak solvation energy, which are 
favorable in large-scale applications [6–9]. Diferent from 
sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) through the insertion/extraction 
of sodium ions to achieve energy storage and output, SICs 
work reversibly under diferent charge-storage mechanisms, 
which are coupled with a battery-type anode electrode via 
insertion/extraction of sodium ions and a capacitor-type 
cathode electrode via surface adsorption/desorption [8]. 
However, the main challenge lies in the unsatisfactory 
kinetic behavior of the anode material when is assembled 
with the cathode material (typically active carbon, AC) [10, 
11]. For example, titanium dioxide (TiO2) is considered as 
an ideal anode material due to its low cost, good cycle stability, high theoretical capacity (335 mAh g−1), non-toxicity 
and nearly zero-strain during charging and discharging process [12–15]. Nevertheless, the low conductivity (~ 10–12 S 
cm−1) and the slow difusion rate of Na+ in TiO2 severely 
limit its practical application. Therefore, the development 
of suitable anode materials is an urgent goal for high-performance SICs.
Point defects engineering (vacancies and heteroatoms 
doping) in compounds is a popular way to modulate their 
electronic structure and chemical properties due to the lattice distortion and electron redistribution [16]. For instance, 
the introduction of oxygen vacancies (OVs) into TiO2 can 
reduce the energy band gap and increase the density of states 
(DOS), thereby enhancing their electrical conductivity and 
kinetic [17–19]. In addition, surface functionalization of 
TiO2 by phosphating can stimulate high chemical reaction 
activity, improve ion difusion dynamics and electrical conductivity to achieve fast and efcient charge transfer, resulting in better electrochemical performance [20–22]. Similar 
efects have also been reported by doping other heteroatoms 
(such as N, S, and F) in TiO2 [23–26]. Although the OVs 
and heteroatoms doping efects have been widely recognized, they still have problems, especially for a high content 
defect. For example, foreign heteroatoms doping content 
is usually low, making it difcult to enter the stable TiO2
crystal structure [27]. Moreover, some theoretical calculations and experimental results indicate that high amounts of 
OVs [28, 29] or dopants [30] can reduce the phase stability, 
which will decrease the difusion rate of Li+, the capacity 
and cycling performance. Therefore, a rational design of the 
point defects is still a challenging task.
Recently, some studies have found that the interaction 
between OVs and heteroatoms can alleviate the bottleneck 
of single point defect regulation [25, 31]. For example, Fang 
et al. reported a M-TiO2@rGO foam with rich OVs and 
F-doping, which can efectively improve electrons/ions conductivity [32]. It is reasonable to assume that more complicated efects can be generated when the OVs and P dopants 
are modulated simultaneously for TiO2, but yet has rarely 
been reported. Herein, the efects of OVs, P-doping, and the 
combined OVs plus P-doping (hybrid point defects, HPD) 
on the chemical states, crystal structure, conductivities and 
sodium storage performance of a TiO2/C anode derived from 
Ti-MOFs were investigated systematically by combining 
density functional theory (DFT) theoretical calculation and 
experimental characterizations. All the results indicate the 
superior of HPD in improving the kinetics and reducing the 
energy barrier of TiO2. When paired with nitrogen-doped 
porous carbon cathode and assembled into hybrid SICs, 
an extraordinary high energy density of 147.9 Wh kg−1 at 
360.0 W kg−1 can be obtained. Even at higher power density 
of 18.0 KW kg−1, the energy density still reaches 76.8 Wh 
kg−1. Furthermore, the SICs also exhibit an ultra-long life 
of more than 8000 cycles at 2 A g−1 with a high capacity 
retention of 83.2%, which endow them with great potentials 
in energy storage applications"
297_intro.txt,"The continuous increase of global warming (emission of CO2,
CH4, and N2O) and fast shortage of fossil fuels elicited more concern
to our society. In order to overcome these problems, finding sustainable and more efficient energy storage devices is important for
all of us [1,2]. In particular, supercapacitor (SC) is a well-known
electrochemical energy storage device, which plays pivotal role in
various sectors like automobile industry, electric vehicles, electronic gadgets, medical, military, and so on. SCs own unique versatile properties of rapid charge/discharge rate; high power
density; longer life span; eco-benign; non-toxic, safe operation, and
so on [3e6]. In recent days, the harvested electrical energy from
renewable resources (wind, solar, and thermal) is effectively stored
in extrinsic integrated hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs), which show
much more research interest and advanced one for self-charging
applications [7,8]. In SCs, the electrode materials are distinguished based on their charge-storage mechanism: (i) electric
double layer capacitor (EDLCs), (ii) pseudocapacitive, and (iii) battery type. In EDLCs, the electrode materials are undergoing nonfaradic with physically adsorption/desorption of ions at electrode/
electrolyte interface where carbonaceous-based materials such as
graphene, bio-derived carbon, and single/multiwall carbon nanotube (S/M-CNTs) are extensively used as anode or negative electrode, which is recognized as a high power source [9e12]. In
pseudocapacitive, the electrode materials follow surface-controlled
faradic redox process and store charges with varied potential. For
example, RuO2 and Nb2O3 are considered as pseudocapacitive-type electrode materials, which is performed intermittent between
EDLCs and battery type [13]. On the other hand, the battery-type
materials follow strong faradic redox reaction and store charges
with constant potential. For instance, NiO, Co3O4, Mn2O3, Cu(OH)2,
CuS, and CeO2 are used as battery-type electrode materials, which
are recognized as a high energy source [14e16]. Among them,
manganese(III) oxide (Mn2O3) is considered as a good battery-type
electrode material, which owns significant futures of higher electrochemical performance, various oxidation states, high theoretical
capacity, earthly abundant, low cost, nontoxic, and so on. Nevertheless, the existence of lower electrical conductivity, simple
structures, and larger-volume expansion severely affects the high
theoretical capacity and longer cyclic life of the material [17,18].
Defect engineering is prominence and believable strategy for
notably increasing of intrinsic conductivity of materials. In particular, the oxygen vacancy/deficiency significantly boost their electrical conductivity, as a result, the electrochemical performances
will be significantly increased [19,20]. Fox example, Wang et al. [21]
reported that the oxygen vacancy is created at the surface of Co3O4
nanowires by fast-reduction method. This beneficial property cause
to increase both electrocatalytic and electrochemical performances.
Similarly, Peng et al. [22] revealed that the created bulk oxygen
vacancy in necklaces-like multishelled hollow structure of binary
metal oxides (NiCo2O4, CoMn2O4, and NiMn2O4) increase their
charge storage capacity and cyclic performance of electrode material. Apart from the defect chemistry, the addition of high
conductive additive material also boosts their electrical/ionic conductivity; as a consequence, it could achieve superior charge storage capacity. For example, Xuemei et al. [23] revealed the prepared
binder-free composite of CNTs/rGO/MnMoO4 exhibits a high specific capacitance of 2374.9 F/g at the scan rate of 2 mV/s with good
cycle stability of 97.1% after 3000 cycles. Further, the assembled
asymmetric SCs delivered a high energy density of 59.4 Wh/kg at a
power density of 1367.9 W/kg with cyclic retention of 87.5% after
1000 cycles. Chun Wu et al. [24] reported that the hybrid rGO with
MneNieCo ternary oxide composite sample exhibits a high specific
capacity of 646.1 C/g at 1 A/g with rate capability of 89.16%. Further,
the fabricated aqueous asymmetric SCs delivered a high energy
density of 35.6 Wh/kg at a power density of 699.9 W/kg with capacity retention of 77.2% and columbic efficiency of 100% over
10000 cycles. Hanieh et al. [25] disclosed that the prepared heterostructured Co3O4/Co3S4 mixed with rGO composite sample show
good battery-type behavior and give high areal capacitance of
13.34 F/cm2 at an applied current density of 6 mA/cm2
. Besides, the
fabricated asymmetric SCs delivered an areal capacitance of
79.15 mF/cm2 at 1 mA/cm2 and delivered high energy density of
0.143 Wh/kg at a power density of 5.42 W/kg. From the above
discussion, we believe that the preparation of uniform morphology
with mesoporous, rich oxygen vacancy, and high electrical/ionic
conductivity will significantly improve the storage capacity of
battery-type cathode material. On the other part, the integration of
harvesting energy from thermal and solar resources with fabricated
SCs could direct the future sustainable self-charging SCs
applications."
298_intro.txt,"Regarding the increasingly serious environmental problems as
well as rapid consumption of fossil fuels, it is imperative to
develop renewable electrochemical conversion and energy
storage technologies.1–5 Supercapacitors (SCs), as a signicant
competitive candidate for energy storage devices in the eld of
portable and wearable electronics, have aroused tremendous
attention due to their superfast energy storage rate, durable
cycling life and high-power density,6,7 whereas their relatively
low energy density drastically limits their widespread application and practical development.8 The electrode material is the
key to determine the performance of the electrode. Therefore,
designing an electrode material with a large ion surface area,
magnicent conductivity, stable electrochemical stability and
a fast ion transport rate is the core of the eld of SCs.9–18
Recently, layered double hydroxides (LDHs), have been
broadly employed for high-performance SC materials owing to
their unique dimensional structures brought by electrochemical performance advantages, such as admirable redox
activity and notable anion exchange capacity.19–21 However, the
impoverished rate performance triggers a sluggish electron
transfer rate, which will lead to limited future application.22,23
For this reason, opening up convenient electronic access for
LDH materials is currently the most popular topic for
researchers now, in the eld of electrode material design.24
Thus, promoting material intrinsic electron transport plays
a pivotal role when taking corresponding measures. As a solution, defect engineering such as introducing oxygen vacancies
into materials, can signicantly elevate the electrochemical
performance by promoting a better OH absorption ability and
electron conductivity, which will lead to increased activity of the
faradaic reaction, and is well accepted.25,26 For instance, Zou
et al. reported that oxygen vacancy abundant NiMn LDH
modulated through mild H2O2 treatment delivers a maximum
specic capacity of 1183 C g1
, far superior than that of
untreated NiMn LDH.27 Similarly, Jin et al. prepared oxygenvacancy-rich CoAl LDH via NaBH4 treatment, which demonstrates a better specic capacity of 799.2 F g1 and possesses
better performance compared to pristine CoAl LDH.28 Although
many synthetic strategies to induce oxygen vacancy-containing
LDH for supercapacitor application have been reported, it is
still a huge challenge to fully expose the active sites of these
synthesized LDH materials and to achieve another leap in
performance, due to the instability of surface defects on materials in the electron transfer process.
A possible remedy to address the above challenge is to
construct heterojunctions that precisely create synergistic
defects at ideal locations to avoid the trade-off effects of individual defects.29 Dual-defect-modulated electrode materials
investigated recently show superior strength in further
enhancing the charge carrier transfer ability and the surface
active sites by using surface heterojunctions.30 In view of this, it is an effective method to design a well matched heterojunction
with double defect regulation for solving the problems of
oxygen vacancy-containing LDH. As a point defect-controlled
material, heteroatom doped carbon material has attracted
extensive attention for its ability to affect the electron donor
properties of carbon materials to enhance the capacitive
behavior for supercapacitors.31–33 The metal–organic framework
(MOF) derived carbon materials as an excellent matrix provider
especially stand out for energy storage application on account of
a designable framework, high specic surface area and great
porosity properties.34,35 For instance, MOF-derived N-doped
carbon nanorod arrays encapsulated with PtCo bimetallic
nanoparticles,36 as well as the carbon tube arrays dispersed with
MOF-derived N-doped carbon show excellent electrochemical
stability for high-rate performance supercapacitors.37
Compared with other dopants, phosphorus doping will produce
the highest electronic modulation efficiency.38 Hence, we expect
that the P doped MOF-derived carbon materials could be used
as an ideal candidate for heterojunctions of oxygen vacancycontaining LDH.
Herein, dual-defect heterostructures modulated by P
doping and the oxygen vacancy strategy with excellent supercapacitor performance are synthesized on CFs and derived
from the MOF-derived hierarchical carbon nanorod arrays via
low temperature phosphating and wet chemical reduction
methods. Both defect regulations on the unique selfsupporting structure create excellent supercapacitance and
are further systematically investigated in this paper. The
prepared MOF-derived P-Co3O4@NC@Ov-NiMnLDH demonstrates a great specic capacity of 285.56 mA h g1
. Additionally, the as-fabricated MOF-derived P-Co3O4@NC@OvNiMnLDH//CNT@ZIF-8 derived C ASC displays an energy
density of 49.06 W h kg1 at 800 W kg1 (power density) as well
as an exceptional capacity retention of 91.92% aer 12 000
cycles. Finally, to verify the practical application value of the
synthesized materials, two ASCs in series can successfully light
up dozens of parallel LEDs."
299_intro.txt,"Pouch devices, as an encapsulating technology for battery-type energy storage 
devices, include many advantages such 
as higher safety, lighter weight, and more 
flexible size adjustment.[1–3]
 Compared 
with the traditional metal shell battery, 
the pouch device’s energy density can be 
increased by 20–50%; the cycle attenuation can also be reduced by 7%. More 
meaningfully, if the battery is stimulated 
to explode, the pouch device can effectively relieve the internal high pressure 
to mitigate the explosion. In recent years, 
many new energy vehicles such as Buick’s 
Blue 6, Chevrolet’s Bolt, and Nissan’s Leaf, 
have introduced pouch encapsulating 
technology in the development of highenergy batteries. This undoubtedly confirms the vast potential of pouch devices 
for practical applications and commercialization. Fortunately, these have also been 
reported in the field of supercapacitors in recent years. Scorsone et al. synthesized a porous diamondcoated polypyrrole electrode by plasma vapor chemical deposition and encapsulated the pouch device with TEABF4  as the 
electrolyte.[4]
 A novel pouch device using Pd nanoparticles as 
the active material and ionic liquid as the electrolyte was successfully encapsulated to collect the energy generated by a wind 
turbine.[5]
 Without exception, most pouch devices rely on expensive and dangerous organic/inorganic solutions or ionic liquids 
as electrolytes, which run counter to the pursuit of low-cost, 
highly safe commercialization requirements.[6–8]
 Therefore, the 
development of a pouch device using an aqueous solution as 
the electrolyte could be commercially significant.
Molybdenum oxide combines excellent physicochemical 
properties such as high specific capacitance, low cost, natural 
abundance, and environmental friendliness, so it is regarded 
as an ideal electrode material for supercapacitors.[9–11]
 Recently, 
Down  et  al. optimized the nucleation conditions of MoO2  on 
the G/AME surface to assemble a MoO2-G/AME symmetric 
supercapacitor with a specific capacitance up to 1212  F  g−1
.
[12]
Zhou synthesized MoO3  nanoflakes with a length of 200  um 
using an improved hydrothermal reaction, which achieved 
a specific capacitance of 1198  F  g−1
  at 2  mV  s−1
.

 An in  situ 
N doping strategy for low-valence-state Mo is reported to synthesize N-MoO3−x with a volume specific capacitance of up 
to 4100  mF  cm−3

[14]
 As a guest intercalator, 
alkylamines, with their easy-to-control chain length, can be 
carbonized to form a conductive layer, while reducing carbon 
can further enrich the valence composition of the host MoO3. 
A few alkylamine intercalated MoO3  have been studied for 
photochromic material and dye composite. Hao  et  al. synthesized an advanced organic–inorganic photochromic material by 
inserting n-butylamine into MoO3.
[15]
 Pan et al. also conducted 
a detailed study on the intercalation between alkylamines with 
different chain lengths and MoO3, and successfully applied 
it to dye composites.[16]
 However, alkylamine-intercalated 
MoO3  materials have never been reported for supercapacitors to the best of our knowledge. The favorable features of 
alkylamine-intercalated MoO3  inspire us to investigate their 
applications as supercapacitor electrode materials.
In this work, using alkylamines as intercalant, a hydrothermal and annealing strategy suitable for industrialization 
has been implemented to successfully synthesize a unique 
alkylamine-tuned MoOx, which includes adjustable interlayer 
spacing, flexible graphitic carbon, and abundant oxygen vacancies. Appropriate interlayer spacing increases ion accessible 
surface area, which can ensure rapid ionic/electron transmission, reduce the diffusion resistance of the electrode/electrolyte 
interface, and improve the utilization of active material. Then, 
the flexible graphitic carbon layer can effectively alleviate the 
volume expansion of the electrode during electrochemical 
charge/discharge process, while accelerating electron transmission. Furthermore, oxygen vacancies can not only promote 
the interaction between the electrode and electrolyte ions by 
reducing the Bader charge of adjacent O atoms, but also reduce 
the band gaps to enhance conductivity. Benefiting from the 
novel three-in-one strategy, alkylamine-tuned MoOx achieves an 
excellent specific capacitance of 717 F g−1
 at 1 A g−1
 while taking 
into account record-breaking cycling stability with 2% capacitive loss after 100  000  cycles. We also encapsulated aqueous 
pouch devices with MoOx-HDA-3  as the anode and MnO2  as 
the cathode to examine the practicality. Encapsulated pouch 
devices can drive fans, tablets, smartphones, etc. stably during 
heavy strikes, fires, and pressures. This work not only illustrates a  novel strategy for preparing unique oxygen vacancyenriched MoOx with different interlayer spacing and flexible 
graphitic carbon in a controlled manner but also promotes 
the potential of the resulting materials for high-performance 
aqueous energy storage systems. We believe that this strategy 
is a general strategy that can be further extended to other pseudocapacitive metal oxides, thereby opening up new innovations 
for high-energy aqueous supercapacitors"
300_intro.txt,"
The remarkable performance and utility of graphene sheets in 
diverse applications, such as electronics, photovoltaics, and energy 
storage, have led to the investigation of new two-dimensional (2D) 
materials [1–3]. The exceptional mechanical and electronic properties 
of graphene have led to faster research and development of these 
two-dimensional materials [4–7]. The unique properties of 2D 
nano/micro-materials often result from charge carriers being confined 
to a single plane [8]. The characteristics of 2D architectures such as their 
surface heterostructure, surface-to-volume ratio, density, stacking efficiency, and defect structure govern their utilization in energy applications [9,10]. The control over these properties of 2D 
nano/micromaterials makes them more attractive as candidates for 
next-generation electronic devices, especially supercapacitors [11]. 
Although several reports have been published on the design and synthesis of higher dimensional materials, tailoring their properties is still 
challenging [12–17]. 
The non-stoichiometric molybdenum oxides (MoO3-x) have become 
extremely popular due to their ability to maintain multiple oxidation 
states, which in turn give them exceptional electrochemical performance [18,19]. Another interesting character of MoO3-x is its ability to 
exist in many metastable and stable polymorphs such as h-MoO3, 
β-MoO3, α-MoO3, etc. [20,21]. MoO3 polymorphs are known to exist as 
crystalline hydrates which upon application of sufficient heat (350-450 
℃) can transform into the stable phase, i.e., orthorhombic or α-MoO3 
[22]. α-MoO3 possesses a layered crystal structure which consists of 
MoO6 octahedra with well-defined planes which are held together by 
weak van der Waals (vdW) forces [23–25]. The weak vdW interlayer 
interactions and strong intralayer chemical bonds (Mo-O) enable MoO3 
to be exfoliated much like graphene and deposited in the form of 2D 
films with large surface-to-volume ratios [19]. By further tuning the 
morphology of 2D MoO3 into sub-categories such as 2D truncated 
microplates and microdisks which are reported in the present work, it is possible to vary the lateral dimension, thickness, interlayer distance, 
surface heterostructure and defect distribution that can further enhance 
the performance of MoO3. MoO3 with a suitable aspect ratio can yield a 
higher number of catalytically active sites. Specifically, due to a greater 
number of exposed facets associated with 2D architecture, these materials exhibit an enhanced level of surface defect structures such as anion 
vacancies, dislocation defects such as edges, kinks, terraces, etc., which 
enhances the surface-active centers and endow greater charge storage 
properties [26]. With its unique characteristics and eco-friendly nature, 
2D MoO3-x has also found a place in plasmon resonance systems, 
light-emitting diodes, photovoltaics, gas sensors, batteries and supercapacitors [27,28]. 
For optimum material performance, controlling the 2D morphology 
of MoO3 is essential. For instance, Parviz et al. [25] used urea to produce 
MoO3 nanoparticles and EDTA and sorbitol to generate MoO3 nanorods 
and microrods, illustrating the importance of bulk organic additives for 
MoO3 synthesis. Due to its high theoretical specific capacitance of ≈
2700 F g− 1 several synthesis methodologies for designing 2D MoO3 for 
supercapacitors have been reported in the literature [29]. For example, 
Murugesan et al. [30] used the reactive radio-frequency magnetron 
sputtering method to successfully deposit 2D MoO3 nanosheets on carbon cloth and achieve a specific capacitance of 240 F g− 1 at a current 
density of 1.5 mA cm− 2 and capacitance retention of 78.8% for 5000 
cycles. Wu et al. [31] demonstrated the synthesis of oxygen vacancy 
enriched MoO3-x nanobelts using a hydrothermal method with ethyl 
alcohol as a reducing agent and displayed excellent capacitance of 1230 
F g− 1 at a current density of 5 A g− 1 and cycling performance of 100% 
even after 38000 cycles. Wang et al. [32] demonstrated the hydrothermal method to produce MoO3 nanobelts that exhibited specific capacitance of 182 F g− 1 at a current density of 10 A g− 1 and 100% capacitance 
retention for 2000 cycles. Li and Liu [33] demonstrated the use of 
dichloromethane assisted hydrothermal method for the generation of 
MoO3 nanoplates, which displayed the specific capacitance of 280 F g− 1 
at the current density of 0.1 A g− 1 and were stable for up to 500 cycles 
with 90% capacitance retention. Cui et al. [34] demonstrated the use of 
a CTAB assisted hydrothermal method to produce MoO3 microbelts, 
which displayed a specific capacitance of 94 F g− 1 at the current density 
of 0.1 A g− 1 with more than 70% capacitance retention for over 1000 
cycles. In spite of reports indicating that 2D MoO3-x morphologies may 
be successfully generated, the additional cost of using expensive 
equipment and the requirement of hard templating agents such as CTAB, 
EDTA, PEG and its associated post-separation treatments and safety 
hazards add to the cost and complexity of bulk scale production. 
Another challenge associated with MoO3 is its low electronic conductivity, which renders a practical capacitor performance far below its 
theoretically realizable value [35,36]. A number of these issues have 
been addressed in the literature through newer synthetic strategies. 
These include mechanical exfoliation, pulsed laser deposition, sputtering, thermal evolution, spray pyrolysis, and electrodeposition techniques [37–41]. Even with the number of techniques reported to date, 
the fundamental requirement of achieving control over the 2D MoO3-x 
morphologies with a well-defined tunable, economical route remains an 
open research challenge to be addressed. We, therefore, emphasize the 
role of protonated urea, combined with the pH-dependent chemistry of 
polymolybdate ions, as a simple tool for achieving tunable 2D MoO3-x 
architectures in the present study. We achieved tunable synthesis by 
optimizing the protonated urea concentration and solution pH to synthesize 2D MoO3-x truncated microplates and microdisks. The present 
approach enables the synthesis of 2D MoO3-x microstructures that 
demonstrate excellent supercapacitor performance in a three-electrode 
and two-electrode asymmetric device configuration. The following 
sections provide more detail on these results.  "
301_intro.txt,"he shortage of fossil fuels, electrochemical energy storage devices are 
playing an increasingly important role and are considered to be one of 
the most promising energy storage systems [1–3], in which supercapacitors (SCs) and batteries have become the most valuable research 
fields due to their higher power density and higher energy density, 
respectively [4]. In addition, in the past few decades, the application of 
portable electronic devices has constantly emerged in the fields of 
consumer electronics [5], biomedicine [6–8], sensors [9] and so on, 
giving rise to flexible and wearable energy storage devices and putting 
forward higher requirements for energy storage devices [10,11]. Since 
SCs were first reported, they have attracted extensive attention due to 
their high power density, ultrafast charging/discharging rate and 
excellent cycling stability among electrochemical energy storage systems [12]. The development of flexible electrodes, solid-state gel electrolytes, separators and flexible packaging materials also makes it 
possible to obtain lighter, thinner, and more flexible SCs [4,13–16]. Lee 
and An [17] reported a flexible smart fibrous supercapacitor consisting 
of surface-engineered carbon fibers functioning as both the electrode 
and the current collector. The developed supercapacitor exhibits a 
robust energy storage performance superior to that of 
previously-reported fiber-based supercapacitors, with a high energy 
density of 3.5-2.0 μWh cm− 2 and a power density ranging from 4 to 30 
μW cm− 2
. 
According to the charge-storage mechanism, the energy storage 
mechanism of SC materials can be classified into two modes [18,19]: 
electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) and pseudocapacitors. Transition metal oxides (such as ruthenium oxide [20,21], manganese oxide 
[22–24], molybdenum oxide [25], nickel oxide [26], cobalt oxide [27], 
etc.) are widely used as active electrode materials mostly because of 
their variable valence states and highly reversible redox reactions. Wu 
et al. [27] constructed a novel wisteria flower-like microstructure of 
cobalt–nickel double hydroxide (CoNi-DH) on carbon cloth. With this 
CoNi-DH electrode as the positive electrode, the as-prepared asymmetric 
supercapacitor delivers an impressive capacity of 204.8 C g− 1
, a superior 
energy density of 42.5 Wh kg− 1
, and satisfactory cycle life. 
Among them, MnO2, as a type of pseudocapacitor material, is 
considered as one of the most promising metal oxides [28] relied on the advantages of a relatively high theoretical capacitance (1380 F/g), 
natural abundance, environmental friendliness and low cost. However, 
its poor ionic conductivity (10− 13 S/cm) and electronic conductivity 
(10− 5
-10− 6 S/cm) [29] along with its poor structural stability lead to a 
huge gap between the actual and theoretical capacitance values, thus 
inevitably affecting the full execution of the theoretically high performance MnO2. Dong et al.[30] developed a method that integrates MnO2 
with graphene and doped it with nitrogen to obtain nanoflower-like 
NG-MnO2 with a capacitance of 220 F/g at 0.5 A/g. Liu et al. [31] reported a hierarchical structure with N-doped hollow carbon spheres 
(NHCs) as the core and MnO2 sheets as the layer via a two-step method, 
in which NHCs were utilized as the template and conductive channel for 
MnO2 to grow on. In addition to combining with carbon materials, metal 
doping is also an effective strategy to improve the conductivity of MnO2, 
which makes it possible to enhance the intrinsic conductivity by 
adjusting the crystal structure and physical interaction without interface 
restriction [28]. Soni et al. [32] synthesized the three-dimensional 
MnO2 nanorods on a carbon cloth (CC) via hydrothermal method to 
fabricate binder-free electrode for flexible supercapacitor application. 
The MnO2/CC based symmetric supercapacitor shows maximum specific 
capacitance of 232 F g− 1 at current density of 0.5 A g− 1 in 1 M Na2SO4 
electrolyte. The high performance mainly corresponds to the porous 
characteristics of MnO2 nanorods developed on CC surface that provide 
active sites for redox reactions, along with low ion diffusion resistance. 
Zhang et al. [33] prepared a nitrogen-doped reduced graphene 
oxide/multi-walled carbon nanotubes/manganese dioxide (NGC/MnO2) 
fiber electrode for flexible all-solid-state supercapacitors. The flexible 
all-solid-state supercapacitor exhibited a high energy density of 5.9 
mWh cm− 3 and a good cycling performance. Zarshad et al. [34] reported 
a core-shell heterostructure made of binder-free Fe-doped MnO2 by a 
self-assembly method. The hierarchical structure contributes to the 
improvement of the conductivity and excellent performance of these 
aqueous SCs by providing abundant active sites that are accessible for 
ion storage, which indicates the improved capacitance of metal-doped 
MnO2 compared with that of pure MnO2. Similarly, Chu et al. [35] 
prepared a multifunctional Mo-MnO2 nanoflower-like structure that was 
subsequently applied to electrocatalytic nitrogen fixation, and found 
that the electronic defects resulting from molybdenum doping improved 
the conductivity of MnO2 and increased the active sites. Since the 
capacitance of the material is closely related to the number of active 
sites, in this study, we employ ammonium molybdate to synthesize 
Mo-doped MnO2 by a hydrothermal method to explore the effect of 
molybdenum doping on the nanostructure and capacitance performance, and then apply it in SCs. 
For asymmetric flexible-solid-state supercapacitors (AFSCs), the 
equation E = 1/2 CV2 determines their energy density [36], which 
shows that the energy of the devices can be further improved by 
increasing the capacitance of the electrode material and expanding the 
operating voltage window by choosing two types of electrode materials 
with the largest work function difference [4]. Previous studies have 
shown that MoO3 (6.9 eV), possessing the largest work function difference compared to MnO2 (4.2 eV), can be an ideal electrode material 
candidate [37]. MoO3 is believed to have the advantages of nontoxicity, 
low cost, and environmental friendliness [38], whereas its application is 
greatly limited due to poor conductivity and fewer active sites [39]. 
Therefore, introducing oxygen vacancies which act as shallow donors to 
increase the concentration of free carriers and expose more active sites, 
is an effective way to improve the conductivity and electrochemical 
activity of MoO3 [40]. Deokate et al. [41] synthesized a nanosheet-type 
α-MoO3 thin film with capacitances up to 1249.2 F•g− 1
, and explored 
the mechanism of redox-type and intercalation-type pseudocapacitance. 
Etman et al. [42] fabricated a self-supporting MoO3-x-CNT film electrode 
by a one-step method, which can be utilized in charge storage devices 
with high charge/discharge rate performance. Wu et al. [43] developed 
oxygen-rich MoO3 nanotubes with a 20% oxygen vacancy content, and 
assembled an asymmetric capacitor with oxygen-rich MoO3 nanotubes 
as the cathode and AC as the anode, which displayed satisfactory 
capacitance. Based on the above research on oxygen vacancies in MoO3, 
in this paper, we use a hydrothermal method to synthesize MoO3, and 
further obtain MoO3-x after phosphorylating combined with annealing 
treatment. Then, an AFSC is constructed by Mo-doped MnO2 and MoO3-x 
as the positive and negative electrode materials, respectively, and 
PVA-LiCl gel as electrolyte, whose electrochemical behaviours are 
emphatically studied and the application prospects are briefly discussed. 
This work provides a new option for metal doping and defect engineering to improve electrode performance and develop new energy 
storage devices, and it provides assistance to energy conversion. "
302_intro.txt,"Rare earth manganites (RMnO3, R = rare earth) are an important
type of perovskite, due to their novel magnetic, electrochemical,
electrical, and magnetoresistive properties.1–9 The physical
properties of perovskites are highly correlated with their structural parameters.8,10 MnO6 octahedra are the basic building
blocks of the structures of RMnO3 perovskites. A tolerance
factor (t) 1 is found in the case of an ideal perovskite structure,
while a range of 0.89 o t o 1.02 is seen for stable perovskite
structures. In cases when t lies between 0.75 and 0.9, the
orthorhombic unit cell is enlarged as a result due to the tilting
of MnO6 octahedra.10 Structural deformation in the perovskite
lattice occurs because of asymmetry in Mn–O bond lengths and
the tilting of MnO6 octahedra. This deformation is known as
Jahn–Teller distortion. J–T distortion is common in perovskites
such as manganites, and the physical properties are highly
correlated with the distortion. The J–T distortion can be
determined from XRD, photoluminescence, and Raman spectra.
Li et al. have derived an important conclusion from Raman data:
orthorhombic distortions or MnO6 octahedral distortions can
be tuned using an applied magnetic field, with the suggestion
that the amount of orthorhombic distortion visible in the Raman
data reduces gradually in response to an increasing magnetic
field.11 GdMnO3, because of its complex low-temperature magnetic
and ferroelectric ordering with an orthorhombic structure, has
been widely studied by research groups.12–15 Previously, many
authors have tuned the physical properties of GdMnO3 through
doping at Gd or Mn sites with different dopants.16–20 One can
relieve the octahedral distortion via doping monovalent or divalent
cations at rare earth sites. Similar modifications can also occur if a
non-J–T active element is doped at Mn sites. In this context, Nandy
et al. have reported that when Na is doped at Gd sites, J–T
distortion is reduced. Due to a reduction in distortion, the
Mn–O–Mn bond angle increases and, as a result, TN increases
from 42 K to 51 K.16 Similarly, Sarguna et al. have shown that
when yttrium (Y3+) is doped at Gd sites, a decrease in TN from
34 K to 32 K is observed due to a reduction in the Mn–O–Mn bond
angle.17 Doping with 5% Tm3+ suppresses the AFM ordering,18
while substitution with Yb3+ enhances the magnetoelectric coupling of GdMnO3.
19 Therefore, changes in J–T distortion
due to dopants present the opportunity to study the physical
properties and investigate technological applications. Apart from
this, perovskite supercapacitors have attracted widespread attention.
In this regard, many authors have reported the electrochemical
properties of perovskites after doping either at A or B sites. Lang
et al. found higher specific capacitance after Sr doping at La sites in
LaMnO3.
21 Wang et al. reported the electrochemical behavior of
GdNiO3 after Sr doping at Gd sites.22 In the present case we want to
study the effects on the structural, magnetic, and electrochemical
properties after Fe doping, with Fe having the same ionic radius but
a different electronic configuration to Mn. In our previous work, we
studied the effects of the Fe concentration x, when x 4 0.2, on the
physical properties,1 where we showed the existence of structural
transformation from an O0
- to an O-type orthorhombic structure,
with an anomalous increase in TN to B298 K, almost room
temperature, when x was varied from 0.3 to 0.5. Along with an
increase in TN, the spin reorientation transition decreases following
an increase in x from 0.3 to 0.5.1 The interesting structural
transformation and magnetic properties led us to study any
structural modifications and the magnetic and electrochemical
properties as a result of Fe doping when x r 0.2. To the best of
our knowledge, up to now there have been no studies on the
structural, magnetic, and electrochemical properties of sol–gelsynthesized 20 at% Fe-doped GdMnO3. Rietveld refinement of
the XRD patterns shows that J–T distortion is decreased, with an
O0 type orthorhombic structure, irrespective of the composition.
The reduction in the J–T distortion factor with an increase in the
Fe concentration is further confirmed from Raman spectra. The
temperature-dependent magnetization reveals that TN increases
from B42 K to B84 K as x varies from 0 to 0.2, and variations in
other magnetic transitions observed at B11 and 5 K are also
seen. The magnetic AC susceptibility is discussed in detail to
understand the spin dynamics of GdMn1xFexO3 (x = 0, 0.1, and
0.2). To study the effects of Fe on the capacitive nature of
GdMnO3, the electrochemical properties are also studied."
303_intro.txt,"As one of the emerging electrochemical energy storage devices, lithium-ion capacitors (LIC) can simultaneously exhibit high specific energy, high specific
power and excellent cyclic life due to their mixed
positive and negative energy storage characteristics
[1–3]. The positive electrode material of LIC generally
uses commercial activated carbon material with
capacitive energy storage. The non-Faraday process
(the double-layer capacitor formed by adsorption and
desorption) produced by the positive electrode
material gives LIC high power density and long-cycling stability. The high-energy density is attributed
to the Faraday reaction (such as lithium-ion intercalation behavior) that occurs on the negative electrode
material [4–6]. However, since the dynamic characteristics of lithium-ion battery (LIB) electrode materials are extremely slower than those of
supercapacitor (SC) capacitor materials, the current
LIC has a long way to go on the road to practical
applications. Thus, battery negative electrode materials with fast Li? release and good rate performance
and high specific capacity electric double-layer
capacitor materials are urgently needed by us, which
can bring about good coordination and efficient
matching of positive and negative electrodes [7, 8].
In recent years, due to the unique size effect, surface effect, synergy and good physical and chemical
properties of nanomaterials and nanocomposites,
they have received extensive research attention. For
example, transition metal oxide nanomaterials are
widely used in photocatalysis, electrocatalysis,
rechargeable secondary batteries and other fields
[9–14]. In addition, some transition bimetal oxide
nanostructure materials and nanocomposite materials have been successfully prepared for the study of
electrochemical hydrogen storage performance, and
exhibit excellent electrochemical performance
[15–19]. Next, based on our previous research work
[20, 21], we then selected oxygen elements belonging
to the same main group as non-metal sulfur and
selenium to construct MoO2 molybdenum-based
compounds as LIC negative electrodes for research.
The reason for the choice is when the transition metal
molybdenum oxide MoO2 material is used as a
lithium storage negative electrode based on the fourelectron conversion reaction, it can exhibit high
reversible capacity (838 mAh g-1
) and high
conductivity ([1 9 104 S cm-1
), better thermodynamic stability, low price and cost, and the existence
of transport channels that are conducive to Li?
transfer in the structure have received extensive
research interest [22–25]. However, the specific
capacity of MoO2 as a negative electrode is mainly
contributed by the semi-infinite diffusion control
behavior, which makes it unable to release a higher
specific capacity when cycling at a higher current
density, and then inhibits the normal performance of
the rate performance of the molybdenum dioxide
anode material [26, 27]. Furthermore, a large amount
of lithium-ion storage will cause significant volume
expansion and smash within the MoO2 lattice structure, which will cause the loss of electrical contact
between the active material and the current collector,
resulting in a shorter cycling life [28]. Thus, the huge
gap between MoO2 negative electrode and activated
carbon positive electrode in rate and cycling performance results in very poor specific power and cyclic
stability of LIC.
In order to address this problem well, the nanoelectrode structure as a very effective method can
greatly improve the rate performance and cyclic life
of its negative electrode material [29]. Compared
with the ordinary block structure, the new nanoelectrode structures (such as nanosheets, nanospheres, nanoparticles and nanotubes, etc.) not only
alleviate the collapse and crushing of the negative
electrode during charge and discharge, but also have
rich specific surface activity. The site allows ion diffusion and charges transfer to become faster [30]. In
addition to nanostructures, another measure is to
combine MoO2 with conductive materials (such as
amorphous carbon, carbon nanotubes, graphene,
conductive polymers) to construct an integrated
composite electrode that can effectively further
improve energy storage performance [31, 32]. Here,
according to the research progress on MoO2 electrode
materials described in Wei’s work [33], it is clear that
nanocomposite materials formed based on the combination of the above two methods are more effective
in improving the electrochemical performance of
MoO2. This not only improves the transport properties of ions/electrons, but also improves the stability
of the structure. At the same time, the previous
research work is relatively cumbersome for the
preparation process of MoO2 carbonaceous composite nanomaterials. Therefore, it is necessary to construct a new nano-carbon-based MoO2 composite
electrode by simple means.
In this work, we report a messy and disordered
composite structure in which carbon nanotubes and
carbon materials are introduced into molybdenum
dioxide (CNT@C@MoO2), which is specifically processed by the solvothermal method in the early stage
and the low-temperature calcination in the later
stage. Then, we characterized the phase structure,
microscopic morphology and pore analysis of the
material, and studied its lithium storage performance
and mechanism. The electrochemical results show
that the new electrode structure with such dimensional hybridization, when used as a high-performance negative electrode material for lithium-ion
capacitors, exhibits better rate performance and
cycling stability than pure MoO2 electrodes in a halfcell. Finally, we use CNT@C@MoO2 as the negative
electrode and commercial activated carbon as the
positive electrode. The assembled LIC exhibits higher
energy density, power density and better long circular life. This research result can be a good reference
for the development of lithium-ion capacitors with
long cyclic life and high-energy density."
304_intro.txt,"Supercapacitors are important equipment for clean energy
storage, which are widely applied in transportation, medical
equipment, aerospace, power supply systems and other fields.1–4
In order to meet the commercial requirements, a promising
supercapacitor unit possesses the characteristics of high power
density, high energy density and long cycle life.5,6 As the core part
of a supercapacitor, the electrochemical performance of the
electrode has been of concern. Transition metal oxides/hydroxides show high specific capacitance as electrode materials due to
their crystal structure and variable valence properties.7–9 Among
them, nickel and cobalt based transition metal oxides/hydroxides
have attracted extensive attention for supercapacitor electrodes,
which is due to their variable valence, thermal stability, high
theoretical specific capacity and low cost. The charge storage
process of Co3O4 involves the Faraday reaction. It has stable
chemical properties and an ultra-high theoretical specific capacitance (B3600 F g1
).10 Co3O4 is also an environmentally friendly
electrode material.11 However, the conventional Co3O4 material
shows low conductivity, which influences its charge transfer process.
Recent studies have shown that the synergistic effect and oxygen
vacancies of composite materials can improve their electrochemical
performance. Moreover, it is worth noting that transition metal
oxides/hydroxides derived from MOFs can memorize the topological
structure of the MOF and become novel materials with good
conductivity and capacitance. Three-dimensional oxygen-deficient
carbon/Co3O4 composites derived from a Co-MOF have a good
electrochemical performance of 423 F g1 at 1 A g1
.
12 ZIF-67
derived Co3O4 rich in oxygen vacancies shows a high specific
capacity of 414 C1 g at 1 A g1 due to the improvement
of charge and ion transfer.13 Besides, nickel hydroxide nitrate
(Ni3(NO3)2(OH)4, named NiNH) is also a transition metal hydroxide, which possesses a unique layered crystal structure, and high
specific capacitance (B1500 F g1
).14,15 For example, porous
NiNH is prepared by one step calcination, which exhibits a good
energy storage performance of 1579 F g1 at 1 A g1 with high
mass loading.16
Herein, we report a novel sandwich layered Co3O4/NiNH
electrode material for high performance supercapacitors. Co3O4
was prepared by calcination of ZIF-67 at 350 1C in a nitrogen and
air atmosphere. The prepared Co3O4 is considered as the crystal
seed which provides growth sites for NiNH under hydrothermal
conditions at 180 1C. ZIF-67 derived Co3O4 induces self-assembly
of NiNH to form sandwich layered Co3O4/NiNH. It possesses
oxygen vacancies and a novel structure which can improve the
performance of supercapacitors. The induction and self-assembly strategy contributes to the development of composite electrode
materials derived from MOFs."
305_intro.txt,"ZnO has received increasing research interest for optoelectronic device applications because of its wide band gap, large
exciton binding energy of ∼60 meV, and ecofriendly nature.1 It
has also shown promising potential as an electrode material in
the field of supercapacitors because of its high electrochemical
stability, high energy density, and high efficiency of charge
storage arising from the fast-reversible redox reaction at the
electrode−electrolyte interface.2 Hence, it can display better
properties as a battery active material.
The fascinating physical properties of ZnO are highly
governed by the atomic-scale defects it possesses. The nature
and the concentration of defects significantly influence the
optical properties of the materials. The optical, electronic, and
physicochemical properties of ZnO can also be tailored by
some suitable substitution and by varying the particle size.
A lot of theoretical and experimental work has been done to
improve the electrical and optoelectronic properties of ZnO by
substituting appropriate dopants. Such an introduction of a
specific dopant enhances the conductive properties of the
material and can hence be used as transparent conductive
oxides (TCOs) as electron transporting layers. An example of
such a usage can be found in a recent work where Cs-doped
ZnO nanoparticles were used as electron transporting layers in
colloidal quantum dot solar cells.3 Improved electrical and
optical properties have been reported in ZnO doped with
group 13 (IIIA) elements, that is, Al,4 Ga,5 and In.6 These
dopant elements have a lower ionization energy than group II
elements such as Zn (ns2
) and hence they can substitute Zn2+
in the ZnO crystal structure and donate excess electrons,
resulting in increased conductivity.
Previous experimental and theoretical studies demonstrated
that Al-doped ZnO has better optical transmittance in the
visible light, whereas Ga-doped ZnO has better conductivity
compared to aluminum- and indium-doped ZnO.7 However,
there are some issues with only Al- or Ga-doped ZnO, which
restrict its utility for large-scale technological applications. For
example, the reaction of Al with oxygen reduces conductivity in
the Al-doped ZnO system. On the other hand, doping with a
large concentration of Ga in ZnO degrades its photoluminescence properties. Also, higher dopant contents inevitably result in a secondary phase, which would deteriorate
the carrier transport properties.
Some theoretical and experimental studies reported the
improved structural, optical, electrical, and thermoelectric
properties of ZnO co-doped with Al/Ga. The results proved
the capability of codoped samples in optoelectronics and the
possibility of obtaining codoped ZnO samples with a lower
resistivity and a higher thermoelectric power factor compared
to conventional only Al- or Ga-doped ZnO.8,9 Thus, it appears
that simultaneous substitution of Ga and Al could be an
effective method to eliminate the drawbacks of singly (Al or Ga
or In) doped ZnO and enhance the various properties. The
strength of one dopant can compensate for the shortcoming of
another dopant. The codoping of Ga/Al in ZnO offers a
balance of performance with respect to only Al- or Ga-doped
ZnO. The size of Ga3+ (0.61 Å) is more comparable to that of
Zn2+ (0.74 Å) as compared to Al3+ (0.53 Å). Thus, the
codoping of Ga3+ and Al3+ at Zn2+ sites results in a lesser lattice
distortion and crystal defects in the ZnO lattice. The 3+
valence state of both Al3+ and Ga3+ ions can reduce the latent
oxygen vacancies and can generate oxygen interstitials.
Codoping Ga and Al simultaneously in ZnO has been
studied.10,11 Various methods have been used to prepare Ga3+/
Al3+ codoped ZnO nanomaterials. In literature, mostly thin
films and the bulk nanoparticles of these materials were
examined detailing the synthesis and optical properties of the
same.12,13 However, a detailed structural, optoelectronic, and
electrochemical analysis of such nanoparticles has not yet been
studied. The tailoring of different electronic properties with
doping concentration is an extremely important aspect of the
functionality of these materials.
The present study investigates this aspect to assess the
properties of these modified materials for supercapacitor
applications. In this work, various compositions of polycrystalline Ga3+/Al3+ codoped ZnO nanomaterials were prepared
using a sol−gel route to ensure a better crystallinity and
homogeneity of the samples. Different kinds of defects present
in the samples and their correlation with the physicochemical
properties have been discussed."
306_intro.txt,"The rapid consumption of natural energy coupled with the everincreasing environmental crisis drives us to develop highly efficient 
energy storage systems [1–5]. Supercapacitors show great application potential as novel high-efficiency energy storage devices, owing 
to their high power density, excellent rate performance, long cycle 
life, and being safe to use [6–10]. Transition metal oxides are regarded as a kind of the most attractive active electrode materials for 
supercapacitors, which store energy by rapid and reversible Faradaic 
reactions and can obtain high energy density, owing to their high 
theoretical capacitance, multiple valence states, and reversible redox 
reaction [11–13]. Among them, Mn-Ni based oxides with multiple 
metal oxidation states are considered as a kind of attractive pseudocapacitive materials, which combine features of the high rate 
capability of MnO2 and greatly high theoretical capacity of NiO [14]. 
Unfortunately, the intrinsically poor electrical conductivity, relatively low utilization efficiency, and sluggish reaction kinetic hamper 
their widely practical application in supercapacitors [11].
To tackle these problems, tremendous efforts have been devoted. 
For instance, a series of nano-scale metal oxides have been synthesized to enlarge the electrochemical active surface area [15,16]. 
Combining metal oxides with highly conductive carbon materials, 
such as reduced graphene oxide (rGO), is also a feasible strategy to 
promote electrons transfer [17–19]. However, some intrinsic limitations of transition metal oxides, such as poor electrical conductivity and sluggish reaction kinetics, cannot be well solved by 
these approaches. Engineering O vacancies into transition metal 
oxides has been proved as an effective approach for modulating their 
electronic properties, considerably optimizing their electrical conductivity, and accelerating the kinetics of the redox reaction [13]. For 
example, Cheng’s and Chen’s groups [20,21] reported that the O 
vacancies can modify the Mn−O bond and the surface configuration, 
enhancing the interaction between MnO2 surfaces and O-containing 
species; a modest O vacancy can reduce the kinetic barrier, resulting in enhanced electrochemical performances. Previous study showed 
that O vacancies in NiMn-layered double hydroxides (LDH) can 
provide unsaturated coordinated atoms, which act as adsorption 
sites to adsorb OH− [22]. In addition, anion-doping in transition 
oxides can improve electrical conductivity, due to the generation of 
detects and the decreased band gap. Liu et al. [14] revealed that the 
simultaneous incorporation of F atoms and O vacancies into FCo2MnO4−x can achieve higher electrochemical performances than 
those of pure Co2MnO4, due to decreased band gap of Co−O, enhanced reaction kinetics, and increased electronic conductivity. 
Their group also revealed that incorporating P into P-CoMoO4−x 
lattice induces lower oxidation state of Mo species and reduces the 
bond energy of Co–O, thus facilitating redox reaction kinetics and 
providing enhanced surface reactivity [11]. Inspired by these valuable results, constructing Mn-Ni based oxides with moderate O vacancies and anion dopants is expected to achieve high capacitance 
performances.
Herein, novel P-Ni2MnO4−x @rGO nanosheets without addition of 
polymer binders were directly grown on Ni foam by hydrothermal 
method, dipping procedure followed by phosphorization treatment. 
The simple thermal treatment with NaH2PO2·H2O can introduce P 
atoms and induced O vacancies into the parent material, which can 
facilitate the electron transfer, provide additional active sites, and 
enhance the surface wettability. Moreover, the interconnected rGO 
nanosheets with P-Ni2MnO4−x can provide continuous pathways for 
electron transfer. Thus, the utilization efficiency and the reaction 
activity of P-Ni2MnO4−x @rGO can be significantly improved. The 
obtained P-Ni2MnO4−x @rGO electrode exhibits greatly enhanced 
electrochemical performances compared with Ni2MnO4, Ni2MnO4 @ 
rGO, and P-Ni2MnO4−x"
307_intro.txt,"Efficient and affordable environmental energy storage devices have 
drawn a significant amount of attention in recent times [1]. Supercapacitors (SCs) have widely been explored for the last decade due to 
their rapid charge–discharge capability, superior cycling stability and 
fabulous power density [2–3]. Conductivity, pore size distribution (PSD) 
and specific surface area (SSA) of electrodes are critical factors to 
accomplish high-performance SC materials [4]. 
Spinel Co3O4 has been proven to be a promising electrode for 
supercapacitors, owing to its high theoretically predicted specific 
capacitance, cost-effective and remarkable lifecycle [5]. Significant efforts have been paid to fabricate different nanostructures of Co3O4 for 
larger SSA with appropriate PSD [6–8]. However, the Co3O4 electrode 
couldn’t meet the requirements for commercial applications because of 
its low conductivity. Fabrication of a binder-free electrode by growing 
active materials directly on the high-conductive substrate is an effective 
way to increase conductivity. This is because the electrochemically 
inactive binder may block the pores and electroactive sites of the electrodes and increase the resistance [9]. Anion doping is found to be 
another approach to improve the electrochemical properties of Co3O4 
electrodes. These improved electrochemical properties are achieved by 
increasing the conductivity, tuning the valence state of metal ions and 
inducing more active sites into the structure [10–12]. Zhao et al. 
developed nitrogenized mesoporous Co3O4 nanoflakes with a capacity 
of 473.3 C g− 1 with a wide potential range by increasing the conductivity and electroactive sites of the structure [10]. In another study, Chen 
et al. fabricated sulfur-doped Co3O4 flower-like microstructures with a 
specific capacitance of 1424 F g− 1 and good cycling stability by 
increasing the intrinsic conductivity and boosting the rate of charge 
transfer [11]. P doped Co3O4 electrode with a specific capacity of 669 
mC cm− 2 and excellent cycling stability of 95.2 % was also reported 
[12]. The improved performance was attributed to the introduction of P 
dopants that could regulate the conductivity and thereby better electrochemical performances [12]. However, the specific capacitances of 
the above-reported electrodes are far away from the theoretical capacitance and the cycling stability reported was not suitable for 
practical applications. 
Recently, transition metal selenides as electrode materials have 
attracted extensive research due to their high conductivity and 
improved electrochemical performance. For instance, Zhao et al. produced HMCS/NiSe2 nanosheets by the selenization of HMCS/Ni(OH)2, 
where HMCS/NiSe2 electrode exhibited improved electrochemical performance (1153.5 C g− 1 at 1 A g− 1 and 80.05 % retention after 5000 
cycles) [13]. In another report, Yang et al. fabricated MXene@CoSe2/ 
Ni3Se4 via an anion-exchange process and the electrode delivered a high 
specific capacitance (283 mAh g− 1 at 1A g− 1
) and 75 % retention after 
10,000 cycles [14]. Similarly, Zhang et al. designed NiSe2/MnSe/rGO 
electrode through the hydrothermal method and the electrode displayed 
a high specific capacity of 1450.7 C g− 1 at 1 A g− 1 and 87 % retention 
after 8000 cycles [15]. These studies further confirmed that O2– replaced 
by Se2- could be a promising method to increase the electrochemical 
performance for energy storage. 
Hence, the selenium partially reduced Co3O4@carbon cloth 
(COS@CC) was synthesized through a straightforward hydrothermal 
method and selenium reduction under nitrogen atmosphere. The 3D 
interconnected nanowire architecture of material with a high SSA provides a large contact area between the different interfaces for ion 
transfer. Selenium reduction regulates the valence states and introduces 
large amounts of oxygen defects in the spinel Co3O4 structure, which 
work as electroactive sites during the electrochemical reaction. The 
COS@CC electrode reveals an excellent specific capacitance, superior 
rate capability and brilliant cycling stability. Electrochemical tests and 
characterizations of materials after the cyclic test were performed to 
investigate the cycling stability of the electrode. Moreover, the flexible 
solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor (FSASC) of COS@CC//Fe2O3@CC 
with PVA-KOH electrolyte reveals high energy density, excellent power 
density and good flexibility."
309_intro.txt,"Supercapacitors, as one of the emerging energy storage devices, have 
been widely applied in the fields of portable electronic devices and 
hybrid electric vehicles [1-5]. Compared to fuel cells and rechargeable 
lithium-ion batteries, supercapacitors show advantages of lost cost, 
high-power density, fast charge and discharge rates, safe operation, and 
long lifespan [6]. However, the low energy density of supercapacitors 
still plays a cask effect for their practical applications. According to the 
definition of energy density E = 1/2 CV2 (C: specific capacitance, V: 
voltage window) [7], two strategies can be considered to enhance the 
energy density, i.e., enlarging the operating voltage range and boosting 
the specific capacitance of electrode materials. The former approach 
appears to be readily achievable by utilizing organic electrolyte, which 
shows a wide range of theoretical decomposition voltages (>3 V). 
However, most organic electrolytes are characterized with toxic, high 
cost, and complex synthetic pathways. Therefore, the development of 
electrode materials with high specific capacitance is a feasible pathway 
to enhance the energy storage capacity of supercapacitors [8,9]. 
In recent years, spinel cobalt-based binary metal oxides, (e.g., 
NiCo2O4 [10,11], CuCo2O4 [12-14], MnCo2O4 [15-17], and ZnCo2O4 
[18,19], etc.) have attracted considerable attention owing to the 
complementarity and synergy effects between two different metal cations: cobalt ions offer multilevel oxidation states and high capacity, 
while the other metal ions are primarily responsible for enhancing the 
conductivity, thus giving rise to better pseudocapacitive performance 
and a nearly double increase in conductivity compared to Co3O4 [20]. Of 
note, MnCo2O4, which inherits the merits of high theoretical capacity 
and excellent durability from Co3O4 and MnO2, respectively, has been 
highly anticipated. The current research on MnCo2O4 electrode materials prefers to focus on further improving electrical conductivity to 
enhance electrochemical performance. For example, Li et al. fabricated MnCo2O4 nanosheets on activated carbon shell (C@MnCo2O4), which 
achieve specific capacitance as high as 728.4F g− 1 [21]. Liu et al. reported a hydrothermal method to synthesize ordered MnCo2O4 nanowire array grown on nickel foam, which exhibited an excellent specific 
capacitance of 2146F g− 1 at a current density of 1 A g− 1 [22]. Zhu et al. 
synthesized a novel battery-like Mn-Co oxide/rGo hybrid nanostructure 
with desirable cycle stability of 95.7% retention over 8000 cycles at 1 A 
g− 1 [23]. Beyond increasing the conductivity, rational structure design 
for electrode materials is also an effective means to improve electrochemical performance, which is more visual and conducive to analyzing 
dynamic behavior in the energy storage process. 
Up to now, several reports regarding simple geometry of MnCo2O4 
powders, including 1D nanorods [24] and nanowires [25,26], 2D 
nanosheets [27], and 3D nanospheres [28], have been successfully 
synthesized and exhibited impressive electrochemical performance as 
compared to their counterparts. However, these MnCo2O4-based electrode materials still face the embarrassment of low practical capacity, 
which is far below the theoretical value. It is well-known that rationally 
increasing the structural complexity of electrode materials will likely 
endow them with enhanced specific capacitance and cycle stability 
through the following aspects [29]: (1) high specific surface area can 
provide large electrode/electrolyte interface and expose plenty of extra 
electroactive sites for surface Faradic reaction, further improving the 
pseudocapacitance properties; (2) continuous phase and structure defect 
can enhance electron transfer capability; (3) more accessible mesopores 
and well-defined cavity structure are conducive to ions diffusion as well 
as enhanced volume change accommodation; (4) coupling effect between the same or different components [30-36]. Unfortunately, to our 
knowledge, there is no comprehensive investigation in the previous 
reports on the effect of morphological evolution on electrochemical 
performance of MnCo2O4 electrode materials with complex structure. 
Inspired by this backdrop, we develop a versatile heating ratecontrolled synthetic route to construct MnCo2O4 microspheres with 
complex interior structures, such as solid structure, hollow structure, 
core–shell structure, and yolk-shell structure. The systematic electrochemical study reveals that morphological change, especially specific 
surface area, strongly affects the charge storage behavior of electrode 
materials. Among four types of interiors, MnCo2O4 microspheres with 
core–shell structure (MCO-CSS) exhibit superior electrochemical performance with high specific capacitance, outstanding rate capability, 
and excellent cycle stability. Higher specific surface area in MCO-CSS 
can provide more electroactive sites for surface Faradic reaction, 
while the well-defined gap acts as an ion reservoir for low-resistant ions 
diffusion paths. In addition, the robust shell and core, which are full of 
accessible mesopores, endow MCO-CSS with excellent rate capability 
and cycle stability. Importantly, the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor device composed of MCO-CSS and porous carbon spheres 
(MCO-CSS//PCS ASC device) delivers higher energy density (33.9 Wh 
kg− 1 at 187.4 W kg− 1
) than those of recently reported manganese 
cobaltite and the relevant ASCs, which brings new opportunities for 
applications in miniaturized and lightweight electronics. "
310_Intro.txt,"The rapid exploration of green and sustainable energy sources
in energy technology has become of great importance due to
the depletion of conventional fossil fuels.1–3 Traditionally,
supercapacitors are good candidates for fullling energy
demands because of their advantage of high power density in
various microdevices.2 Although supercapacitors possess
a long lifetime and excellent reversibility, their intermediate
energy density features (oen <10 W h kg−1
) are not competitive with batteries, restricting their practical applications.2,4
Flexible energy storage devices are becoming an alternative and
mainstream for electrochemical storage equipment in modern
society.5,6 Particularly, exible hybrid supercapacitors (FHSs)
play a leading role as exible devices in wearable electronics,
because of their good exibility, safety, and lightweight
compared to other devices as well as long cycle life with
impressive energy/power densities.7,8
The construction of FHS devices with maximum energy
density while maintaining their structural exibility and power
densities is becoming a hard and challenging task for
researchers. Bare exible current collectors, such as carbon
cloth (CC), carbon paper, graphene-coated woven fabrics, silver,
and nickel fabrics show relatively low-capacitive performance,
but they act as backbones to design such FHS devices.9,10 Among
the given substrates, CC is one of the versatile current collectors
and it has considerable diverse merits such as lightweight, costeffectiveness, and good mechanical strength. Covering the
surface of CC bers with partial nanostructures has the disadvantages of weak bonding and poor compatibility.5,11 Ultimately, the active species can be easily removed from their
surfaces, which leads to inert surfaces and thus poor cycling
results in an electrochemical system. The key to overcome this
issue is aiming for the design or growth of uniform nanostructures with well-maintained three-dimensional architectures on the entire surface of CC bers, which can help to build
more effective active sites with a larger surface area. The developed active sites are the key to achieve a rapid diffusion
rate and greater energy storage which lead to high capacitance
of electrodes.
Recently, cation-doping in single and bimetallic oxide-based
compositions has attracted much attention and is found to be
a good technique to increase electrical conductivity, charge
transfer ability, and capacitance.12–14 It has been well proved
that introducing a foreign transition metal ion into a selective
host matrix can overcome the existing drawbacks in electronic
states and trigger electrode reactivity by improving the iondiffusion kinetics, and further it also opens an avenue to
develop new approaches.12,15,16 Among the various metal ions,
Cu possesses good electrical conductivity, and it is available at
a cheap cost and is recommended for doping. In addition to the
cation-doping strategy, the introduction of some vacancies into
the host crystal lattice could intrinsically alter its physicochemical behavior.17,18 The generation of oxygen vacancies
(OVs) is a very rare study in electrochemistry that can assist in
increasing the number of active sites and enhance the electrical
conductive properties of electrodes.19,20 As is known, the
generation of OVs is complex usually consisting of multiple
steps and requiring harsh atmospheric conditions. However,
the development of OVs in the lattice crystal structure without
any hazardous experiments is becoming an innovation in the
energy storage eld.21,22
By considering the above-mentioned advantages, we
designed a-NiMoO4 nanosheets decorated on CC by a facile
hydrothermal method. In addition, a series of concentrations
of Cu metal ions (1, 3, 5, and 7 mol%) were introduced into
the Ni host lattice site by a cation-doping strategy under the
same experimental conditions of pristine a-NiMoO4@CC.
During the cation exchange process between Ni and Cu, the
host crystal lattice and morphology were majorly changed
and hierarchical urchin-like microowers were observed. In
the higher Cu content (a-Ni0.95Cu0.05MoO4@CC) electrode,
the Cu metal disturbed the adjacent metal atom vacancies in
the host a-NiMoO4 composition to maintain local charge
balance during the cation-exchange process which further
leads to the generation of OVs (a-Ni0.95Cu0.05MoO4−y@CC).
As explored, the advantages of OVs and the synergistic effect
of Cu and other metal ions in the a-Ni0.95Cu0.05MoO4−y@CC
electrode led to a specic capacity of ∼342 C g−1 at 1 A g−1
current density with impressive rate capability, which is
higher than those of the pristine a-NiMoO4@CC and other
low Cu-content electrodes. Based on the superior performance, the designed pouch-type FHS (a-Ni0.95Cu0.05MoO4@-
CC//activated carbon (AC)@CC) device further showed
maximum energy/power densities along with long-term
cycling stability. Portable electronic energy storage devices
were successfully operated using two FHS devices with
a maximum voltage window of 3.2 V. Consequently, the
synergistic effects in the optimal a-Ni0.95Cu0.05MoO4@CC
electrode enriched with OVs resulted in an impressive electrochemical performance compared to its counterparts,
which can also inspire researchers to develop new ideas for
high-performance electrodes"
312_Intro.txt,"The improvements in various electrochemical energy storage
and conversion systems are reshaping our daily life and
leading to sustainable energy in the future.1–3 Hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs) and zinc-ion batteries have attracted worldwide attention as important electrical energy storage devices
driven by the demand for portable medical and electronic
devices, electric vehicles and aircraft.4,5 Nonetheless, these
devices need considerable improvement to meet the requirements of electric vehicle applications, as well as high energy
storage and portable electronics.6,7 As we all know, the characteristics of electrode materials directly determine the overall
performances of energy storage devices.8 In the past decades,
various strategies have been proposed to improve the electrochemical properties of electrode materials while obtaining brilliant achievements.9,10 However, the research progress of
cathode materials is relatively sluggish, which has become a
major obstacle to the practical application of hybrid supercapacitors and Zn-ion batteries.
Recently, transition metal oxides (TMOs) have been extensively used as functional electrode materials thanks to their
noteworthy advantages, and different TMOs such as Co3O4,
NiO and MoO3 have been synthesized.11–13 However, the low
specific capacity due to their low electrical conductivity is
unsatisfactory, limiting the transport of ions at the electrode
and electrolyte interface. To overcome these problems, binary
metal oxides with larger specific surface areas have become
hot research objects, which are expected to improve in terms
of rate capability and cycling stability.14–16 Amongst these,
binary metal Ni/Co-based oxides have attracted much attention
as electrode materials, and all kinds of nanosized NiCo2O4
materials including nanotubes, nanowires, microspheres,
nanosheets, etc. have been successfully designed, and exhibit
extraordinary electrochemical properties owing to their inherently high active area available due to multiple redox reactions.17–20 Nevertheless, the electrochemical kinetics of
NiCo2O4 are still constrained by its unsatisfactory material utilization efficiency and poor electronic conductivity. Fortunately,
the accelerated progress in two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials with the advantages of long-range marginal electronic propagation and improved active surface area makes it
very suitable for energy storage. In particular, the transition of
metal ions from a low-spin state to a high-spin state along the
edge layer enhances the charge transfer ability and carrier
migration rate.
In the previous work, the first-principles calculations show
that defect engineering can generally improve the charge transfer rate in the multistage redox processes and enhance the performance of electrochemical kinetics in hybrid supercapacitors
and zinc-ion batteries.21–24 For example, Cui and co-workers
report that a facile modification of the interface of the original
Co3O4 nanoribbons (Co3O4 NRs) is operated to obtain the
vacancy-rich Co3O4 NRs via the wet chemistry reduction of
NaBH4. The results show that the richness of oxygen vacancies
in Co3O4 NRs prepared by the NaBH4 reduction method can
result in more electroactive sites and reduce the electrical resistance for boosted supercapacitor performance. And the DFT
studies showed that existing oxygen vacancies decrease the
band gap and endow the electrodes with enhanced intrinsic
electrical conductivity and charge transfer, which are beneficial for the enhancement of electrochemical performance in
supercapacitors.25 However, as the electrode structure serves a
critical factor, tailored integrated nanoarchitecture design plays
a crucial role in constructing excellent electrochemical performance supercapacitors and batteries.26 Therefore, it is desired to
design and prepare advanced 2D NiCo2O4 nanosheet electrodes
with abundant oxygen vacancies for hybrid supercapacitors and
zinc-ion batteries, but it is still challenging.
Herein, ultra-thin NiCo2O4 nanosheets with abundant
oxygen vacancies (V-NiCo2O4) are introduced by a simple
hydrothermal method followed by NaBH4 reduction. The concentration of the vacancies can be controlled by tuning the
concentration of NaBH4 and reaction time. DFT reveals that
the presence of rich oxygen vacancies not only can efficiently
lower the conduction band as the electron capture center, but
also provide more exposed active sites and facilitate the redox
reaction. As a consequence, the V-NiCo2O4-4 electrode delivers
a high specific capacity (751.7 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1
) and favorable rate capability. In addition, the assembled V-NiCo2O4-4//
AC HSCs achieve a specific energy 57.1 W h kg−1 with a high
specific power 241.5 W kg−1
and outstanding cycling durability
(only 8.1% decay within 10 000 cycles). Furthermore, when
they are employed as a cathode in Zn-ion batteries, a specific
capacity up to 420.1 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 with a good cycling
performance of 80.1% capacity retention after 2000 cycles was
observed. Unexpectedly, a remarkable extremely high energy
density (717.4 W h kg−1
) and power density (1710 W kg−1
) are
achieved, which is superior to most reported aqueous Zn-ion
batteries in the literature. These consequences can provide a
compelling insight for the design of high-performance electrodes and widespread application to electronics in the future."

sources. However owing to the inherent fluctuations in renewable and 
alternative energy sources, energy storage systems are critical. Hence 
energy storage systems will play an important role in the transition from 
carbon-economy to a renewables based one. These energy storage/ 
conversion devices themselves ought to be sustainable, and economically viable. In fact it is rather clear that it should be of substantial 
utility, with all the electrical and life cycle parameters duly achieved, to 
meet the energy demands on scale associated with electric vehicles, 
large-scale smart grids, and the fast-growing consumer electronic industry [1,2]. 
Supercapacitors (SCs) or electrochemical capacitors are promising 
and efficient energy storing devices owing to their considerably high 
capacitance, faster charge-discharge rates, high power density (>
10,000 W kg− 1
) and long cycle life ( ̴ 105 cycles) [2,3]. SCs can be 
classified into pseudocapacitors and electric double-layer capacitors 
(EDLC) based on the mechanism of charge storage. The charge storage in 
pseudocapacitors happens through a series of redox reactions at the 
surface of the electrode material. On the other hand, EDLCs store 
charges through the adsorption-desorption process that occur at the 
electrode-electrolyte interface. This results in the formation of 
double-layer of charges at the interface [4]. 
Typically, EDLC electrode materials include carbon derivatives such 
as graphene [5], activated carbon [6], carbon nanotubes [7], etc. 
because of their high specific surface area (up to 3000 m2 g− 1
) and 
desirable pore architecture [8]. Electrochemically active materials with 
variable oxidation states such as metal (transition and rare earth) oxides 
[9–12], sulphides [13,14], nitrides [15], carbides [16], oxynitrides [17], 
and conducting polymers [18,19] are examples of pseudocapacitive 
electrode materials. 
Pseudocapacitors deliver higher energy density (20–80 Wh kg− 1 for 
pseudocapacitors) than EDLC materials (10–20 Wh kg− 1
). For instance 
A.K Yedluri and co-workers developed a flexible hybrid supercapacitor device (FHSCs) with Ni(OH)2@ZnO–ZnCo2O4 nanowire arrays as electrodes [20]. This FHSC device has an excellent energy density of 80 Wh 
kg− 1
, which is much better than the usually reported values for pseudocapacitors. Furthermore pseudocapacitive materials exhibit very high 
specific capacitance/specific capacity, which is nearly 10–100 times 
greater than that of EDLCs [4,21]. 
An example to the high specific capacity of pseudocapacitive material is the Cu-Co sulfide nano-reed electrodes developed by J.H Yoon and 
group [22]. This Cu-Co based electrode material delivers a specific capacity of 158.9 mAh g− 1 at a current density of 2 A g− 1
. A.K Yedluri et al. 
have reported a binder free, multicomponent electrode material 
composed of NiCo2O4 @ NiMoO4 with honey comb structures [23]. This 
electrode material not only shows excellent specific capacitance of 2695 
F g− 1 but also good energy density of 61.2 Wh kg− 1
. Because of advantages like high energy density, specific capacity, redox reactions, 
etc., pseudocapacitive electrode materials can be considered ideal candidates for SC applications when compared to EDLC materials [24]. 
However, the large-scale applications of pseudocapacitors is limited 
because of their poor electrical conductivity, cyclic and structural 
instability, and kinetic irreversibility (quasi reversible Faradaic reactions) [25]. The reason for this can be attributed to the volume 
expansion-induced structural deformation in these materials during the 
charge-discharge processes (redox reactions) of energy storage [26]. 
Given this, there is need to improve the performance of pseudocapacitors by developing novel electrode materials that possess better 
physicochemical properties (i.e. a combination of structural stability, 
while also offering good enough pseudocapacitance). Another approach 
involves the use of composite materials through the introduction of 
carbon conductive networks to the TMOs which results in hybrid SCs. 
Hybrid SCs benefit from the synergy between the EDLC and pseudocapacitive material, thus enabling enhanced storage properties. However, 
the process deployed in the synthesis of the composite materials is 
complex and improper bonding of the materials with the substrate can 
cause serious stability and cyclability issues [27]. 
As an alternative to TMO electrodes, and to overcome the inherent 
drawbacks associated with volumetric shrinking-swelling caused structural instability (as is the case with oxides), transition metal nitrides 
(TMNs) have been employed. TMNs possess higher conductivity, mechanical and chemical stability, and low leakage currents ( ̴ 1 μA) when 
compared to their corresponding TMOs [17]. For instance, titanium 
nitride (TiN) has a conductivity in the range of 4 × 103 to 5.55 × 104 S 
cm− 1
, whereas TiO2 has a value that ranges from 0.1 to 1 S cm− 1 [28]. 
Nevertheless, TMNs suffer from the disadvantage of lower storage capacity and poor rate capability [25,26] which can be addressed by using 
the materials that have the desirable properties of both TMOs and TMNs. 
Transition metal oxynitrides (TMONs) are an emerging class of 
electrode materials wherein some of the oxygen atoms of TMOs are 
replaced with nitrogen atoms. TMONs offer the advantages of both 
TMOs and TMNs such as higher electronic conductivity, specific 
capacitance, improved hydrophilicity, chemical inertness, and stability 
[17]. The higher electronic conductivity is due to the reduced bandgap 
in TMONs compared to TMOs. This is because the 2p orbitals of nitrogen 
have higher energy compared to oxygen, which either narrows the 
bandgap or results in the overlap between the conduction band and 
valence band of TMONs [29]. Higher electronic conductivity results in 
better rate capability of the TMON electrode materials [17]. Also the 
replacement of oxygen atoms of charge − 2 with nitrogen atoms of 
higher charge − 3 creates the tendency for oxygen vacancy formation in 
TMONs, thus paving a way for bringing more active sites in contact with 
the electrolyte [27]. Thus the Gibbs free energy of the redox reactions 
occurring at the surface of the electrode reduces. This enables more 
Faradaic reactions at the electrode-electrolyte interface resulting in 
higher capacitance when compared to corresponding TMOs or TMNs 
[26,27]. Importantly, TMON will have an amorphous layer on the corresponding TMOs, and this layer helps in suppressing the structural 
deformation of the materials. Thus TMONs can offer improved structural 
and cyclic stability compared to TMOs [1]. 
In this context, various transition metals are reported whose oxynitrides have proven useful for supercapacitor applications. These 
include cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), vanadium (V), chromium (Cr), iron (Fe), 
tungsten (W), titanium (Ti), molybdenum (Mb), etc. For example, 
recently Naveen Kumar et al. made nano-spherical CrOxNy using a 
simple soft urea technique. This material exhibited excellent cyclic 
stability with a 98% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles [2]. Zou 
and co-workers have reported a binder-free TiOxN1-x nanogrid film 
which delivered a high power density of 166.1 kW kg− 1 with 95.8% 
capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles [30]. Hao et al. prepared 
TMON (Fe, Co, Ni, V) nanowires electrodes which gave a cyclic stability 
of 94% after 10,000 cycles. The material also showed a two-fold increase 
in specific capacity compared to the corresponding pure TMO [26]. 
Binary TMO electrode materials wherein there is a co-existence of 
two metal cations with variable oxidation states offer the possibility of 
fast and reversible redox reactions [31]. The higher electrical conductivity offered by bimetallic oxides over monometallic oxides improves 
the transportation of electrons and ions during electrochemical reactions [32–34]. From this perspective, and because of advantages such 
as eco-friendliness, abundant availability, and low cost, Ni-Co oxide has 
gained a lot of research interest [1,35]. 
The redox reactions in Ni-Co oxide will have contributions from the 
multivalent Ni (Ni2+/Ni3+) and Co (Co2+/Co3+) which is expected to be 
much higher than that of unary Co oxide or Ni oxides. Ni-Co oxides 
exhibit very high capacitance and energy density but they also suffer 
from the inherent drawback of low cyclic stability (structural instability) 
and rate capability. These disadvantages are because of the poor mechanical stability and electrical conductivity issues associated with NiCo oxides. These challenges can be addressed by introducing oxygen 
vacancies in Ni-Co oxide. One can do this by making oxynitrides (NiCoOxNy) from the corresponding parent oxides (Ni-Co oxide in this case). 
Given this, it does seem reasonable that nickel-cobalt oxynitrides can 
offer a combination of advantages associated with both the pure bimetallic oxide and nitride phases. In NiCoOxNy oxygen vacancies are 
created by replacing some of the oxygen atoms by nitrogen atoms. These 
vacancies can not only act as active sites for the electrochemical reactions but also can act as electron donors there by enhancing the 
electrical conductivity of the Ni-Co oxide [1]. Therefore, NiCoOxNy has 
the advantages associated with its better electrical conductivity, stability (mechanical and chemical) and superior electrochemical properties, 
including rate capability, energy density, and power density. Importantly, NiCoOxNy (bimetallic oxynitride) nanostructures are unexplored 
as supercapacitor electrode materials. In this context, an attempt is 
made here to study the electrochemical energy storage characteristics of 
NiCoOxNy nanostructures. 
To its evaluation, we prepare bimetallic nickel-cobalt oxynitrides 
using the soft-urea synthesis route. The preliminary material performance evaluation is carried out in a 3-electrode system. An asymmetric 
device has also been fabricated to investigate the relevance of the material in practical applications. Interestingly our findings show that 
NiCoOxNy nanostructures as supercapacitor electrode materials exceed 
the supercapacitive performance (in terms of energy density) of all 
oxynitrides reported thus far. The material’s performance is owing to its 
composition which contains oxygen and nitrogen atoms along with two 
multivalent cations. This study reveals that nickel cobalt oxynitrides are 
promising electrode materials for next-generation high energy and 
power density electrochemical energy storing devices.

314_Intro.txt,"The emerging industries such as artificial intelligence, 
wearable equipment, fexible display, and robot developed 
dramatically over the past 10 years, pushing energy storage devices to be the research hotspot. Supercapacitors 
have been favored as an efcient renewable energy storage 
device, especially since the introduction of the asymmetric hybrid supercapacitors concept, which has signifcantly 
improved the working cell potential and energy density of 
supercapacitor devices [1]. Transition metal oxides have also 
attracted the attention of researchers as common electrode 
materials in supercapacitors [2, 3]. As a transition metal element, vanadium exists in the form of a mineral in nature. 
It abounds in natural resources in China. Compared with 
cobalt, ruthenium, and manganese, vanadium is cheap, 
green, and produces less pollution. The fve valence electrons in the outermost layer of element V can participate 
in the bonding, so vanadium is a multivalent metal compound. Among them, V5+ is the most stable, followed by 
V4+, and V3+ and V2+ are relatively poor. Therefore, V2O5, 
VO2, and V6O13 are widely studied [4, 5]. It is well-known 
that vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) has a unique layered structure and unique properties in the felds of electronics, optics, 
and electrochemistry. It also has the advantages of low cost, 
convenient synthesis, and various chemical valence states. 
Therefore, it is widely used in catalysts, sensors, capacitors, 
electrochromic devices, and lithium-ion batteries [6–9].
However, due to the intrinsic low conductivity and slow 
charge difusion in the cycling process, V2O5 electrode material has poor cycling performance and small capacitance, 
which hinders its practical application. In order to solve this 
problem and improve the electrochemical performance of 
V2O5, many methods have been developed. For instance, 
the size and morphology of the V2O5 nanostructures can be further optimized by designing and synthesizing the composition and assembly method of V2O5 electrode nanostructures, which can efectively promote the mass and charge 
transfer of the electrode materials in the charge–discharge 
process, and adapt to the volume change in the cycle process 
[10–12], for example, Li et al. [13] reported the ultrathin 
nanoplate morphology and sulfde content account for the 
impressive electrochemical performance. Finally, the V2O5
nanomaterial with diferent morphologies such as nanowires, nanosheets, and nanospheres for supercapacitors has 
been studied [14–16]. For example, Xu et al. [17] reported 
V2O5 nanobelt arrays with a specifc capacitance of 498 F 
g−1, and Robert et al. [18] revealed 3D V2O5 architecture 
with a high specifc capacitance of 451 F g−1. In addition to 
designing its morphology and structure, many researchers 
also try to combine V2O5 electrodes with carbon nanotubes, 
graphene, or conductive polymer to form composite materials, so the conductivity and the chemical performance of the 
interface between electrode and electrolyte can be improved 
[19–21]. Bi et al. [22] compounded V2O5 nanoflms with a 
diverse genre of conductive polymers to obtain the higher 
performance supercapacitor electrode (the capacitance is up 
to 618 F g−1). Besides, defects can also be used to change 
the surface crystal structure of V2O5 electrode materials. 
Studies have shown that when V2O5 was synthesized at high 
temperature, because of the high concentration of oxygen 
vacancies, some thermally activated polarons in the sample 
are quite high, and these polarons can be used as carriers 
of intrinsic n-type semiconductor V2O5 [23]. Therefore, the 
overfow of oxygen ions caused by defects will be more conducive to ion doping and adsorption, which will efectively 
improve the ion transport efciency in the electrochemical 
process [24, 25].
In order to investigate the impact of structure and lattice defects on the electrochemical performance of V2O5, 
we also analyzed the crystal structure of V2O5. V2O5 crystal has orthorhombic structure with lattice constants of 
a=1.1519 nm, b=0.3564 nm, c=0.4373 nm [26, 27]. The 
V in V2O5 is in the distorted V2O5 three-way biconical structure unit. Five oxygen atoms exist in three kinds of shape, 
which makes the VO4 tetrahedral unit be linked into a chain 
through the oxygen bridge. The two chains are connected 
to a chain through the ffth oxygen atom, forming a layered 
structure, and then connected with the oxygen atoms in the 
other layer. Six oxygen atoms are formed around one vanadium atom, The layer spacing is 0.28 nm, which forms a 
distorted octahedron, and fnally forms a V2O5 crystal [28]. 
Hence, the O in the V2O5 tetragonal pyramid can be divided 
into three types: (1) the O is nearest to the center V (denoted 
as O1), the V=O double bond between vanadium and oxygen, with a bond length of 154 pm; (2) connected with two 
Vs, it is a bridge oxygen atom O2 with a bond length of 
202 pm; 3) one bond length is 177 pm and the other two are 
188 pm [29]. This kind of crystal structure is favorable for 
the doping and difusion of ions, and oxygen ions can easily 
overfow to produce vacancy defects, which can improve the 
electrochemical performance of V2O5.
The concept of oxygen vacancy was proposed by Tompkins [30] in the 1960s, which is considered to be a substance 
in solid surface chemistry. Oxygen vacancy is caused by the 
omission of oxygen atoms in the lattice of metallic oxides, 
which also happened in oxygen-containing composites. This 
sort of vacancy will create crystal defects and accelerate the 
form of vacancies in the lattice. Therefore, a large number 
of oxygen vacancies introduced in metal oxides lead to great 
changes in the physical and chemical properties of materials, 
such as electronic structure, optical absorption, geometric 
structure, and surface adsorption properties, which greatly 
expands their applications [31, 32]. A large number of scholars have studied their physicochemical properties diferent 
from stoichiometric oxides. Most of the research concentrate 
mainly on how to emerge oxygen vacancy and the distribution of oxygen vacancy in oxide [33, 34]. For example, Liu 
et al. [35] revealed that the structural and electronic properties in F-Co2MnO4 − x is efectively tuned by introducing 
F dopants and oxygen vacancies, synergistically increasing 
electrical conductivity and providing rich Faradaic redox 
chemistry. The resultant F-Co2MnO4 − x achieves a high specifc capacity of 269 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1, and superior cyclic 
stability with 93.2% capacity retention after 5000 cycles at 
15 A g−1. Kim et al. [36] compared the reduced α-MoO3
with the fully oxidized α-MoO3 and found that the introduction of oxygen vacancies in the α-MoO3 lattice increases 
the interlayer spacing and MO4+ content, thus prolonging 
the cycle life and specifc capacitance. Wang [37] et al. 
reported the capacitance of Co3O4 nanowires reduced by 
NaBH4 was increased to 978 F g−1; Sun [38] et al. had proposed to upgrade the creation of oxygen vacancies in metallic oxide anodes by laser irradiation and chemical reduction 
in solution. The outcome reveals that the optimized anoxic 
conditions are of great signifcance to achieve electron/ion 
balance and promote ion storage. These reports reveal that 
the conductivity and specifc capacitance of metal oxides 
can be efectively improved by surface functionalization or 
introducing oxygen vacancies as shallow donors.
Based on the above discussion, the electrochemical performance of V2O5 based electrode materials for supercapacitors still needs to be improved. Through this study, it 
is not difcult to fnd that oxygen vacancy, as a unique lattice defect, can regulate the electronic structure of transition metal oxides, but keeping the whole lattice invariant, 
thus signifcantly advancing the electrochemical properties 
of transition metal oxides. In addition, oxygen vacancy can 
upgrade the charge transfer in electrode materials, even in 
the case of large layer spacing, and retain the structure of 
electrode materials during the electrochemical cycle process. Therefore, by introducing oxygen vacancy into the transition 
metal oxides, the specifc capacitance of the electrode material can be enhanced and the cycle time can be lengthene"
316_Intro.txt,"Increasing environmental pollution and energy crisis have stimulated research on the design of efficient and environment-friendly energy storage system. Among these novel and renewable energy storage 
devices, supercapacitors and metal–ion batteries have attracted extensive attention because of their safer operation, faster charge–discharge 
and longer cycling life than conventional batteries and capacitors. 
Therefore, the selection of electrode materials to simultaneously satisfy 
the requirements of supercapacitors and metal–ion batteries is still 
critical and challenging for the development of clean and sustainable 
energy technologies. 
Currently, numerous transition metal oxide nanomaterials are 
considered a type of promising alternative cathode materials because 
they possess various oxidation states, which are essential for redox reactions. Ni–Co-based oxides with large theoretical capacity and low cost 
are the key research objects. Nevertheless, the currently developed 
Ni–Co-based oxides are far from satisfying the practical requirements in 
the field of energy storage. This finding is mainly due to inferior 
conductivity (semiconducting nature), slow kinetics of electrochemical 
conversion reaction and large volume changes during charge/discharge 
process. As a result, the approach obtains poor rate and cycle performance, which remains to be further improved to satisfy the application 
requirements. 
Carbon and nitrogen are introduced into the supercapacitor electrode materials to effectively improve electronic conductivity and cycle 
performance. The combination of highly conductive carbon materials, 
such as carbon nanotubes [1], graphene [2] and nitrides [3], with 
transition metal oxides (TMOs) can not only serve as physical support of 
TMOs, but also provide multiple channels for faster charge transport. 
Our previous literature focused on studying the structure and electrochemical properties of the nitrogen-doped carbon layers coated on 
NiCoO2. It has also been confirmed that an appropriate N-doped carbon 
layer can induce sufficient active sites and accelerate electron transfer 
[4]. 
In addition, the optimisation of annealing temperature in TMOs can 
significantly adjust the electronic structure [5], generate oxygen vacancies [6] and optimise adsorption energies of active species [7] to improve the electrochemical properties of electrode materials in the 
field of aqueous metal–ion batteries. 
Based on the above considerations, a facile hydrothermal method 
followed by annealing process was designed to fabricate a hierarchical 
urchin-like NiCoO2@N-C nanosphere assembled by numbers mesoporous nanorods. Herein, we reported a very simple approach to 
modulate the surface defects of these as-synthesised electrode materials 
by controlling the calcination temperature. The electrochemical measurements in a three-electrode supercapacitor revealed that the NiCoO2@N-C sample calcined at 300 ◦C exhibited the best electrochemical 
performance among all other samples. Furthermore, an admirable capacity of 323 mAh g− 1 was achieved by the assembled NiCoO2@N-C// 
Zn battery at a current density of 0.5 A g− 1
. More importantly, to provide 
critical insights into the mechanism of charge storage and conversion of 
the supercapacitors and aqueous zinc–ion batteries, X-ray Absorption 
Fine Structure (XAFS), ex-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and in-situ Raman 
spectroscopy have been applied to probe subtle structural evolution of 
electrode materials during charge and discharge processes. This work 
demonstrates the great potential of NiCoO2@N-C hybrid electrodes in 
high-performance energy storage devices."
318_Intro.txt,"The electronics market includes a huge variety of smart TVs, 
smartphones, speakers, cameras and medical devices just to mention a 
few. The power required to operate them has also increased because 
they need to work over longer periods of time. Currently, the lithium-ion 
batteries (LIBs) are used for this purpose, but they produce a huge 
ecological damage when they are disposed in the environment 
(contamination of the water and soil by corrosive compounds and nonbiodegradable plastics) [1]. In fact, the LIBs batteries cannot be fully 
recycled and they are stored in special containers at the end of their life 
to avoid any leakage of corrosive compounds to the environment [2]. On 
the other hand, the supercapacitors (SCs) are now of great interest 
because they possess a high power density, good cycle stability, simpler 
structure than the Li-ion batteries and are able to deliver their charge in 
miliseconds if necessary [3,4]. In fact, the modern electronics tries to 
incorporate flexible SCs on fabrics or clothes. In this sense, several works 
have developed various efficient electrode materials for SCs such as: 
NiCo2S4@CoMoO4 core–shell nanowire arrays on carbon cloth [5], hierarchical carbon cloth@CoMoO4@NiCo-layered double hydroxides [6] 
and Zn0.76Co0.24S/NiCo2S4 nanosheets on carbon cloth [7]. Those materials could be used for portable and wearable devices because they 
produce remarkable capacitance values of 2000–2700 F g− 1
. The solid 
state devices made with these materials exhibited high energy densities of 48–67 Wh kg− 1 while maintaining a high capacitance retention of 
80–92% after 5000 cycles of charge/discharge. Furthermore, the 
capacitance and energy density of the flexible SCs have been enhanced 
by using other state of the art materials such as: N-doped graphene (NG) 
encapsulated witn Nickel-Cobalt nitride (NiCo2N@NG) or NiFeN@NG 
[8], free-standing Ni-Mo-S and Ni-Fe-S nanosheets [9], nanoporous 
manganese nickel selenide (MnxNi1-xSe2) and manganese iron selenide 
(MnxFe1-xSe2) nanosheets [10], ultra-thin copper nickel sulfide (Cu1-xNixS) nanosheet [11] and nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes 
(Co–NCNTs) grown on NG [12]. Those materials have been employed to 
make electrodes of flexible SCs with outstanding energy densities in the 
range of 80–95 Wh kg− 1
. The solid state devices made with these materials also presented high capacitance retention of 95–100% after 10, 
000–25,000 cycles of charge/discharge. Moreover, carbon-based materials (carbon nanotubes, activated carbon, graphene and porous carbon) 
have been extensively used in flexible SCs. Particularly, graphene is 
interesting because it has high surface area (2675 m2 g− 1
), high electrical conductivity and excellent mechanical characteristics (~1 TPa) 
[13]. Some works about the use of graphene in SCs are: Zheng et al. [14] 
made aerogels with graphene oxide (rGO) and carbon nanotubes (CNT) 
and fabricated a flexible solid-state supercapacitor that produced a 
capacitance of 252 F g− 1 and capacitance retention of 99.5% after 1000 
cycles of charge/discharge. Another research group synthesized metal 
organic framework (MOF) materials with high porosity and made 
electrodes composed of MOF and graphene oxide (GO). These were used 
to construct a SC that reached a maximum capacitance of 273 F g− 1
, 
energy density of 50.5 Wh kg− 1 and ≈100% capacitance after 10,000 
cycles of charge/discharge [15]. The group of Obeidat et al. [16] synthesized mesoporous graphene as electrode for flexible SCs, which 
showed a moderate capacitance of 214 Fg− 1
, energy density of 33.3 Wh 
Kg− 1 and a capacitance retention of 99.9% after 4000 cycles of charge/recharge. Another report demonstrated that electrodes of holey 
graphene framework (HGF) with high surface area (~1030 m2
g− 1
) 
produced a capacitance of 298 Fg− 1 and energy density of 35 Wh kg− 1
, 
while maintaining 91% of its initial capacitance at the end of 10,000 
cycles of charge/discharge [17]. Moreover, Romanitan et al. [18] made 
a solid state SC using an electrode of graphene/nanoporous silicon 
electrode. The device produced a maximum capacitance and energy 
density of 162.4 F g− 1
, energy density of 25 Wh kg− 1 and capacitance 
retention of 80% after 1000 cycles of charge/discharge. In general, all 
the SC electrodes/devices based on graphene reported so far present the 
following issues: (i) they present low capacitance values (<300 F g− 1
), 
(ii) their graphene component is synthesized with complex procedures 
and (iii) their energy densities are low (<51 Wh kg− 1
). For these reasons, 
the current research is looking new materials to be combined with 
graphene in order to increase its electrochemical performance. 
On the other hand, the high consumption of plastics and electronic 
products has leaded to the contamination of soil, rivers, oceans and air. 
This occurred because massive amounts of electronic waste, bottles, 
packaging etc. are disposed in the environment without strict ecological 
controls and those contaminants release heavy metals, toxic electrolytes, 
dyes among others [19]. This last issue is critical for the human health, 
since the water and soil contaminated with chemicals can produce 
cancer, skin diseases and body intoxication. In order to address this 
critical issue, the residuals/waste should be reused to avoid such 
contamination. An important approach currently used to take advantage 
of such waste is using it for the fabrication of flexible supercapacitors or 
making flexible SCs whose components can be recycled. For example, 
Wu et al. [20] fabricated a reclyclable SC employing electrodes of Polyvinylidene fluoride - acetylene black - polyethylene glycol - polyaniline 
(PVDF-AB-PEG-PANI) film electrode. In consequence, the device produced a maximum specific capacitance 798 F g− 1
, energy density of 
79.15 µWh cm− 2 and 72.5% of capacitance retention after 5000 cycles of 
charge/discharge. After the electrochemical tests, the 
PVDF-AB-PEG-PANI electrodes were cleaned with deionized water, 
dried and dissolved to form a slurry-paste. This mixture was again used 
to make more electrodes and demonstrated the reusability of the electrodes to make other SCs. Another research group synthesized activated 
carbon from the waste filter carbon in household water purifier and was 
used to make SC electrodes that showed a capacitance of 122.8 F g− 1
, 
energy density of 15.4 Wh kg− 1 and capacitance retention of 69.1% after 
800 cycles of charge/discharge [21]. Thus, the results proved the possibility of reusing the carbon from simple and common carbon sources. 
Moreover, coffee is one of the most popular drinks in the world, agricultural and economically important for many nations and millions of 
tons of coffee waste are produced worldwide [22]. This waste is a source 
for cellulose based materials and a precursor for porous carbon materials 
that can be utilized for SCs [20]. By considering this last situation, Jisha 
et al. [23] synthesized porous carbons by pyrolysis of coffee waste with 
high surface area of 1945 m2 g− 1 and made a device that produced a 
maximum capacitance of 121 F g− 1
, energy density of 35.4 Wh kg− 1 and 
capacitance retention of 90.5% after 5000 cycles [24]. Another 
byproduct that is wasted by millions of tons is the tire. It contains 
30–35% of carbon and have been used to synthesize porous activated 
carbon (AC) with surface area of 1627 m2 g− 1 by pyrolysis and chemical 
activation processes [25]. After this, the AC was mixed with a conducting polymer of polyaniline (PANI) to form a PANI/AC composite, 
which was employed as electrode for SCs. Those presented a maximum 
capacitance of 480 F g− 1
, energy density of 17 Wh kg− 1 and capacitance 
retention of 98% after 10,000 cycles of charge/discharge [25]. Another 
team explored the use of activated carbon obtained from newspaper 
waste by pyrolysis (400 ◦C) and a chemical activation process with 
H3PO4 for SCs and found a maximum capacitance of 380 F g− 1 [26]. 
Furthermore, Farzana et al. recycled Zn-C batteries and recovered 
Mn3O4 particles. Those were annealed at 900 ◦C and spherical manganese oxide particles were obtained. Next, these were converted to 
electrodes for SCs and the devices exhibited a maximum capacitance of 
125 F g− 1 and moderate capacitance retention of 80% after 2100 cycles 
[27]. This last approach demonstrated that useless batteries are a source 
of key elements for a new generation of electrochemical energy storage 
devices through an environmentally friendly approach. Similarly, the 
waste from Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic (which is produced 
by the high consumption of drink bottles, bags, containers, etc.) can be 
used to generate active carbon for SCs according to Mirjalili et al. [28], 
who made SCs with such derived PET carbon and found a maximum 
capacitance of 32.6 F g− 1 and a outstanding capacitance retention of 
126.7% after 7000 cycles or charge/discharge. As observed, the previous reports demonstrated that the contamination produced by biomass 
or plastics can be reduced if the wastes are processed appropriately to 
make solid state SCs. Making those devices with recycled materials is 
relevant because they can be used to provide electric charge to conventional products such as smart phones, watches among others. However, the SCs mentioned above have the following drawbacks: (i) the 
capacitances and energy densities provided by these SCs fabricated with 
recycled materials/waste are still very low for the commercial standars, 
(ii) complex logistic chains would be required to constantly supply such 
waste for the mass production of SCs and (ii) high temperature processes 
are required to generate the activated carbon from the waste, which is 
necessary to make the SC electrodes. Due to these disadvantages, it is 
necessary the exploration of other abundant wastes for the fabrication of 
SCs. In this sense, the tetrapak waste could be a good candidate because 
it is produced by 100 millions of tons per year and it is widely produced 
by the food industry (190 billions of packages worldwide per year) [29]. 
This waste is abundant and it is made of biodegradable cellulose. The 
average composition of the tetrapak container is cellulose (71%), 
aluminum (5%) and plastic polymers (24%) [29]. Thus, we studied in 
this work the fabrication of flexible graphene SCs using tetrapack based 
electrodes. For this purpose, we cut pieces of tetrapack recycled from 
milk containers and deposited on them a layer of graphene nanoplates to 
make the tetrapak conductive. After this, we deposited on the graphene 
a redox composite of Ag/BaMoO4 (BAMO). This molybdate compound 
was selected because it is eco-friendly, has a low optical band gap, has a low cost and it can be synthesized from abundant elements such as Mo 
and Ba [30]. Furthermore, the Barium molybdenum was chosen due to 
its high thermal and chemical stability [31]. In addition, the presence of 
the Ag nanoparticles (NPs) on the surface of the molybdate was beneficial because they increased its capacity of redox reactions for the 
charge storage. In fact, it has been demonstrated that the presence of Ag 
NPs enhances the capacitance by 2–10 times [32]. 
The main novelty of this work is demonstrating that efficient solid 
state SCs can be fabricated using recycled tetrapak (an abundant waste 
worldwide) as part of their electrodes as well as showing that recycled 
paper from notebooks can be used as separator into the SCs. Devices 
made with these recycled materials has not been reported to the best of 
our knowledge. Moreover, we used the BAMO as redox material to 
improve the electrochemical performance of the SCs, which has not been 
previously demonstrated. Basically, we found that adding the Ag/ 
BaMoO4 composite into the SCs enhanced the capacitance and energy 
density by 90% and 110%, respectively. The BAMO/tetrapak based SCs 
also presented a good electrochemical stability because their capacitance retention was above 92% after 500 charge/discharge cycles and 
above 83% after 500 bending cycles. Hence, the findings of this work 
can inspire to the development of highly efficient SCs from recycled 
materials, which would reduce the contamination of the environment by 
plastic or electronic waste. If these devices are efficient enough, they can 
be used to feed everyday products such as cell phones, watches, sensors, 
remote controls among others."
319_Intro.txt,"Supercapacitors have received a great deal of attention as an energy storage device
in the electric vehicle and consumer electronics industries because of their fast charge–
discharge features, long cycle stability, and high power densities [1–5]. However, due to
their low energy density, they are unable to meet the demands of high-performance supercapacitors in the market [6,7]. As a result, high-performance electrodes are urgently required.
A significant amount of attention has been focused on the transition metal hydroxides
(LDHs), particularly cobalt-based LDHs, due to their rich morphology, low cost, and high
activity [8,9]. For example, NiCo-LDH had superior high theoretical specific capacitance
of 774 F·g
−1 at the current density of 0.2 A·g
−1
[10]. However, the relatively sluggish
electrochemical reaction kinetics of NiCo-LDH, like the relatively low charge transport rate,
the low specific surface area, poor conductivity, and limited exposed electroactive sites,
consequently, hinders the electrochemical performance [11–13]. The energy storage mechanism of the supercapacitor depends on the faradaic reactions
and charge accretion [14]. Double-layer capacitance and pseudocapacitor are two important
storage principles to determine the capacitance of a supercapacitor. However, pseudocapacitive material based on LDHs has a larger capacitance per gram than double-layer
capacitors [15]. Aside from the choice of LDH materials, the nanostructure of LDHs plays an
important role in facilitating ion transport within the electrode materials [16,17]. Based on
the aforementioned issues, hierarchically porous materials and other hierarchical structures
can help to improve superior specific capacitance and energy density, which is thought to be
a viable strategy to improve NiCo-LDH electrochemical performance. For instance, NiCoLDHs with desirable morphologies, e.g., nanosheets [18], nanowires [19], nanoflakes [20],
nanotubes [21], nanoflowers [22], and microspheres [23], have been synthesized to improve
the electrochemical activity by exposing more active sites and shortening the diffusion
lengths of both electrons and ions. In addition, creating surface defects is also an efficient
strategy to change the nanostructure of LDHs, which has the potential to improve the
activity of electrode materials. In particular, the improvement in intrinsic conductivity
can accelerate the diffusion of ions and promote charge transfer dynamics, resulting in
enhancement of electrochemical performance [24–27].
Several modification methods, such as thermal annealing treatment [28–30], acid
etching [31] or alkali etching [32], NaBH4 reduction treatment [26,33,34], and hydrazine
hydrate reduction treatment [24,25,35], have been reported in previous studies to generate
the defective structures in electrode materials. Among these methods, hydrazine hydrate
as a mild reducer has received considerable attention. For example, Li et al. adjusted the
generation of oxygen vacancies in Co3O4 electrodes through controlling the hydrazine
hydrate volume to optimize the electrochemical lithium storage [24]. In order to improve the
catalytic performance of Co3O4 nanosheets for rechargeable Li-O2 batteries, Gao et al. used
hydrazine hydrate reduction to control the production of oxygen vacancies and roughen
the surface of Co3O4 nanosheets [25]. In addition, hydrazine hydrate reduction was also
employed by Chen et al. to increase the activity of the oxygen evolution reaction [35]. Thus,
hydrazine hydrate as a reducing agent has obvious advantages in manufacturing surface
defects and oxygen vacancies for transition metal oxides. However, it should be noted that
the above-mentioned methods mainly adopt the “open” system of liquid-phase treatment.
Although hydrazine hydrate is a strong polar compound and can be well mixed with water,
the surface defects of oxides are affected by the concentration of hydrazine hydrate and
other factors.
Compared to the modification method of gas-phase treatment, liquid-phase treatment
has the disadvantages of lengthy cleaning and drying operations, as well as a complex
preparation process. In our previous work, we used the solvent vapor to process oxides
via a novel “sauna reaction”, and successfully synthesized MoO3−x nanobelts with rich
oxygen vacancies [36]. To this end, considering the reductive characteristics of hydrazine
hydrate and the low boiling point temperature, combined with our previous research, we
consider using the steam of hydrazine hydrate to directly treat the electrode surface.
In this paper, we present a simple vacuum-assisted hydrazine hydrate reduction strategy for the production of 3D flower-like NiCo-LDH microspheres which are enriched in
pores and have surface defects. As expected, the obtained 3D-NiCo-SDBS-LDH electrode
delivered an enhanced specific capacitance of 1148 F·g
−1 at 1 A·g
−1
, as well as long-term
stability with a capacitance retention of 94% after 4000 cycles. Moreover, the assembled 3DNiCo-SDBS-LDH//AC device presented a maximal energy density of 73.14 W h·kg−1 at
800 W·kg−1 and remarkable cycling stability of 95.5% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles. Results show that LDH improves electrochemical performance and cycling stability
by altering electrode structure of the nanosheets."

of photons and converting them into electrical energy, they
can be chosen as the electrode materials [2]. Excited electrons
at the photosensitizer were transferred to the semiconductor
(SC) anode via the sensitizer–SC interface, which were further
used in the external circuit. Anode SC needs to possess a
high surface area, high exciton energy, high photon-to-electron
conversion, and high electron mobility possessing material
for high efficiency [3]. In DSSCs, insufficient adsorption of
photosensitizer on the electrodes and recombination of photogenerated charge carries are the major challenges [4]. Recently,
metal oxide SCs such as TiO2, ZnO, Nb2O3, ZrO2, and SnO2
are used as DSSC electrodes and they attained the maximum
efficiency of 14% in their pristine format [5]. Among the anode
materials mentioned, SnO2 nanostructures are found to be the
most appealing due to their better electron mobility [∼100–
200 cm2/(V·s)] and wider bandgap (∼3.6 eV) nature [6].
Incorporation of noble metal particles such as Ag and Au
on the surfaces of SnO2 nanoparticles facilitates the surface
plasmon resonance (SPR)-assisted hit electrons’ formation
at visible light [7]. Considering the efficient energy storage
system for future, development of high-energy supercapacitors
is an important field of research interest. Supercapacitors are
designed to store high electrochemical energy and to offer
high power density, high energy density, larger capacitance,
and longer lifetime and be eco-friendly [8]. Pseudocapacitors,
a type of supercapacitor, possess high energy density and
exhibit higher efficiency [9]. SnO2 nanostructures are found to
be n-type SC and more suitable for electrode preparations due
to their high electrochemical stability, high oxygen evolution
over potential, and high theoretical specific storage capacity
(782 mAhg−1) [10]. However, pristine SnO2 suffers from
low carrier density at room temperatures which decreases the
capacitance performance and charge–discharge stability [11].
This can be rectified by utilization of conductive metal
nanoparticles such as Ag and Au on the SnO2 nanoparticles
by means of reducing the charge transfer resistance and
providing excellent electronic/ionic conductivity, as reported
in [12]. Additionally, metal nanoparticles unveil pseudocapacitive nature and retain a high specific capacitance with
improved energy density and power density [13]. Recent
reports exhibited the specific capacitance values for CO2O3,
GZnO, SnO2, ZnFe2O3, and MoS2SnO2 to be 54, 84, 154.33,
122, and 61.6 F/g, respectively. Nano size of the particles featured amazing capacitive behavior that is responsible for
fast moving of ions from electrolyte to electrode [14]. Also,
the Ag/Au nanoparticles increase the redox potentials and
also provide more stability even under stretching circumstances [13], [15]. Considering the above-mentioned advantages, Ag/Au-incorporated SnO2 nanoparticles have been used
in both DSSCs and pseudocapacitor applications. A facile
green synthesis has been conducted for the preparation of
Ag/Au-integrated SnO2 nanoparticles as an efficient electrode
for these applications [15]. Since this method is nonpolluting
and cost-effective, it is regarded as the most efficient method
of fabrication of nanomaterials. The extract is obtained from
the rhizome of the plant Corallo Carpus epigaeus, since it
contains several chemical substances such as crude protein,
carbohydrates, and alkaloids, which are responsible for the
reducing properties and also act as a capping agent [14]."
322_Intro.txt,"Current industrial activities contaminate water and soil with
dyes, acids, pharmaceutical products, metal ions (Cr(VI) and
As(III)) [1, 2], plastics (residuals of polyvinyl carbonate, polyethylene terephthalate and poly(styrenesulfonate)) and electronic waste (circuit board and batteries) [3, 4]. Most of this
toxic waste cannot be released into water or the atmosphere
because it will produce huge ecological damage [5]. Such
toxic waste is normally recycled or treated to decrease the
level of toxicity before its release in the environment, but this
carries a high financial cost for the companies because special facilities are employed for this purpose [6]. Due to the
high cost for recycling, most companies prefer the storage of
toxic waste in confined places (underground, caves in desserts
or industrial metallic tanks), but sometimes these containers
are broken after long periods of use and the toxic waste is
slowly released into the environment [7]. At the same time,
we have in the world an energy crisis because human activities require energy for cars, buildings, industrial activities, etc
and currently this energy is produced by burning fossil fuels,
which in turn, produces changes in weather patterns and global
warming [8]. For this reason, the scientific community is looking for renewable and environmentally friendly solutions for
the generation and storage of energy, above all to replace
technologies that employ fossil fuels as the main source of
energy. In this sense, supercapacitors (SCs) have emerged as
a viable solution for energy storage due to their characteristics
of high-power density, good operational safety, controllable
charge/discharge times and long lifetimes [9]. Furthermore,
SCs are becoming important for printed electronics because
recent reports have demonstrated that they can be printed on
materials such as paper substrates, textiles and plastic substrates while maintaining a high power density, high electrochemical stability and long lifetimes [10]. In this sense, some
interesting woks about printed SCs have appeared. Cheng et al
[11] reported flexible planar micro-supercapacitors fabricated
with inkjet-printing, which exhibited an outstanding capacitance 46.6 mF cm−2
and high capacitance retention of 86.6%
after 1000 cycles of charge/discharge at an angle of 180◦
.
Another work by Li et al [12] studied the electrochemical performance of flexible solid state SCs based on Ag NWs/PEDOT:PSS electrodes. Those devices reached a maximum areal
capacitance of 8.56 mF cm−2
and 90% of capacitance retention after 2500 cycles of charge/discharge.
In general, SCs can be manufactured with attractive physical characteristics such as small size, thin shape, lightweight
and flexibility. Those last features and the use of porousorganic-polymers/solid-electrolytes in the SCs allow their use
in portable electronic devices such as flexible cell phones, flexible displays, electronic skins, implantable medical devices,
among others [13–16]. Researchers worldwide are looking
for new procedures and methodologies to integrate recycled
materials in the manufacture of SCs. Here, the main goal is
giving a second use to the waste generated by human activity
to generate energy while contributing to the care of the environment. For example, coffee waste [17] can be processed to
produce battery electrodes with a high capacity of 1428 C g−1
.
A promising alternative to produce green SCs with moderate
energy densities (17–30 Wh kg−1
) is employing aqueous neutral electrolytes [18]. Another option is burning any biomasswaste for the generation of biocarbon, which can be used to
make electrodes for SCs: For example, Wu et al [19] prepared
carbon microrods form albizia flowers, which had a high surface area of 2757 m2 g
−1
and produced a high capacitance of
406 F g−1
(at 0.5 A g−1
) and energy density of 26.3 Wh kg−1
.
Furthermore, Biswal et al [5] synthetized a microporous conducting carbon with a high surface area of about 1230 m2 g
−1
using a biomass source of dried leaves from the Neem tree
(Azadirachta indica). This carbon exhibited a maximum specific capacitance of 400 F g−1
(at 0.5 A g−1
) and energy density of 55 Wh kg−1
in an aqueous solution of 1 M H2SO4.
Moreover, Konikkara et al [20] prepared hierarchical porous carbons (HPC) using leather waste as the precursor. HPC
showed a maximum capacitance of 1960 F g−1
in 1 M KCl
electrolyte. This carbon electrode also showed high capacitance retention above 95% after 500 cycles of charge/discharge.
Additionally, Wu et al [21] developed flexible supercapacitors
using electrodes made with activated microporous carbon and
this was obtained by carbonizing almond shells. They reported
a high energy density of 53.3 Wh kg−1
and a specific capacitance of 283 F g−1
(at 1 A g−1
) for their devices, which
also showed a high stability, since their capacitance retention
was 82.7% after 5000 cycles of charge/discharge. Similarly,
Quian et al [22] synthesized (N, S, Fe, Mg, As)-doped porous carbon flakes via carbonization of human hair for flexible
supercapacitors, these doped materials exhibited high specific
capacitance of 340 F g−1
(at 1 A g−1
) and an energy density of 29 Wh kg−1 when characterized in an aqueous solution of 6 M KOH. Those devices also demonstrated a good
stability because their capacitance retention was 98% after
20 000 cycles of charge/discharge. Another work by Chen et al
[23] fabricated a flexible all-solid-state supercapacitor device
with nitrogen-doped pyrolyzed bacterial cellulose (p-BC-N)
as the electrode material, this device could deliver a maximum energy density of 6.07 Wh kg−1
and showed a good cyclability, since its capacitance retention was 95.5% after 5000
cycles of charge/discharge. Also, Ma et al [24] proposed a onestep pyrolysis method to convert tassel tree flowers into 3D
honeycomb-like hierarchically porous carbons, which would
be used for energy storage applications. The capacitive property of this material was studied, and the authors found a high
capacitance of 394 F g−1
(at 0.5 A g−1
) when they employed
an aqueous solution of 6 M KOH as electrolyte. A symmetric flexible all solid-state capacitor was fabricated using a
polyvinyl–alcohol (PVA)/KOH gel electrolyte and exhibited a
high energy density of 18 Wh kg−1
as well as a good capacitance retention of 96% after 5000 cycles of charge/discharge.
Other biomass waste such as jack fruit peel has been used by
Rajabathar et al [25] to synthesize a porous nanostructured
carbon, which was utilized to make electrodes for flexible SCs.
The specific capacitance of the device was 324 F g−1
at the
scan rate of 5 mV s−1
and the electrolyte was an aqueous solution of Na2SO4. In addition, the capacitance retention was 93%
after 5000 cycles of charge/discharge. Finally, Wen et al [26]
converted waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET) beverage bottles into porous carbon nanosheet (PCNS) by using catalytic carbonization and KOH activation. The PCNS with high
surface area of 2236 m2 g
−1 was tested as electrode for SCs
and produced a maximum capacitance of 169 F g−1
in an
aqueous solution of 6 M KOH. Also, the maximum energy
density was 30.6 Wh kg−1
(at 0.2 A g−1
) and the capacitance
retention was 90.6% after 5000 cycles of charge/discharge.
On the other hand, there are also reports about the use of
waste to make electrodes for batteries. For instance, Li et al
[27] demonstrated that biomass-derived proteins (white egg)
could serve as an ideal precursor to synthesize carbon materials for energy applications. The carbon material obtained
from eggs was employed as the anode in flexible LIBs. A
maximum capacity of 1780 mAh g−1
and specific capacitance of 390.4 F g−1
(at 0.5 A g−1
) were obtained. Further,
this carbon material showed a capacitance retention >93%
after 10 000 cycles of charge/discharge. The waste of walnut shells has been used by Tao et al [28] to prepare carbon
nanofibers and were employed as flexible anode electrodes in
LIBs. Those exhibited a maximum capacity of 380 mAh g−1
(at 0.03 A g−1
) during the first 10 cycles but decreased to
280 mAh g−1
after 200 cycles of charge/discharge. The carbonization of textile fibers is another useful strategy to produce carbon electrodes for LIBs: Zhao et al [29] reported the
synthesis of 2D carbon nanosheets (CNS) using Kapok fiber
as the precursor. The CNS were used as electrodes in Liion supercapacitors, which produced a voltage of 4 V, energy
density of 30–100 Wh kg−1
(at 0.1 A g−1
) and a capacity of
51.3 mAh g−1
. However, the capacity retention of this device
was low, only 70% after 5000 cycles of charge/discharge. The
production of porous carbon from waste of biomass (from
seeds, eggs, algae etc) or plastic and its use as electrode in
supercapacitors or batteries have become attractive in the last
few years because such waste is abundant and can be found
everywhere. Nevertheless, that porous carbon produced from
biomass/plastic waste still has the following problems: (1) Its
synthesis from waste needs to be carried out at high temperatures of 400 ◦C–1000 ◦C [30], which involves a high consumption of energy. (2) Its surface must be activated with chemical
agents such as KOH, NaOH, H3PO4, ZnCl2 or with oxidizing
gases, such as air, O2, CO2, steam, etc [31] in order to control
the porosity and surface area [32], a procedure that requires
long times and a complex setup. (3) The methods to synthesize carbon from wastes are not scalable, which makes their use
for the industrial production of electrodes for supercapacitors
difficult.
The waste employed for the fabrication of carbon electrodes for supercapacitors is not toxic or inert and does not
cause contamination problems to the environment in general,
but the ultimate trend is using/recycling toxic waste for the
fabrication of energy storage devices. Investigations about this
are very scarce, since we could find only two works about the
use of toxic materials for batteries: Ajeya et al [33] reported
a method to recover vanadium compounds (VCs) in the form
of vanadyl sulfate (VOSO4) from industrial waste and used it
as an electrolyte in redox flow batteries (RFB). VCs are not
suitable in industrial effluents because those are released in
rivers and oceans. As a result, that group obtained a maximum
capacity of 1.21 Ah and energy efficiencies above 80% after
50 cycles of charge/discharge. Moreover, Schlemmer et al
[34] explained that lignin (a complex polyaromatic biopolymer which is produced in a large scale of 50−100 megatons
per year in the pulp and paper industry) could be used as
source to produce vanillin, and this in turn, would be the source
to produce redox active quinone 2-methoxy-1,4-hydroquinone
(MHQ), which is employed as the electrolyte in RFB batteries. Basically, the authors demonstrated that MHQ produced
from lignin was useful to make a battery with a maximum
capacity of 93 mAh l−1
, energy density of 27.1 Wh l−1
and
97%–99% coulombic efficiency over 250 cycles of charge/discharge. Those cycles were carried out during 8 months of continuous battery operation, since each cycle of charge/discharge
lasted 24 h. Although those RFB batteries have demonstrated
good performance using toxic materials as electrolytes, they
have the following disadvantages: (1) The electrodes of these
batteries are fabricated with expensive materials such as gold
and NAFION membrane. (2) The batteries employed a mixture of liquid acids (H3PO4 or H2SO4)+ contaminant as the
electrolyte, thus, the electrolyte was not exclusively made of
the toxic waste and this reduces the consumption rate of the
toxic material. In addition, the use of liquid acids in batteries is currently not suitable because they are toxic compounds
for the environment and humans. (3) The cycles of charge/discharge of the RFB batteries can last 1–24 h, which make their
use impractical for real applications. (4) They are not compact solid state devices, they were tested in specialized setups
where a huge cell and two tanks are employed, due to the
enormous size of the RFB batteries, they cannot be used for
portable applications such as cell phones, tablets, laptopts etc.
Although the use of some toxic contaminants have been
reported to make RFB batteries. Nobody has reported compact, flexible and solid-state energy storage devices that
employ any contaminant as the electrolyte. The contaminant
vinasse could be an interesting candidate for this purpose.
It could be used as electrolyte for supercapacitors because
it has the following characteristics: (1) it has an acidic pH
(which favors ion conductivity), (2) it has a high content of
ions (derived from the distillation process) such as: K, Ca,
Mg, S, Zn, Mn, Fe and Cu [31] and (3) it is a waste generated
in quanitites of millions of liters from distillation processes.
Vinasses are generated from the tequila industry in Mexico,
it is a brown liquid contaminant produced during the distillation process of tequila (20 l of vinasses are produced per
liter of distilled alcohol) [35, 36]. The pH of this contaminant is 3–4 and has a high content of organic compounds [37].
Due to their low pH, vinasses are considered corrosive compounds and cannot be stored in metallic containers, therefore,
this contaminant is stored in plastic containers [37]. These
vinasses are dangerous for ecosystems. If they are released in
rivers, the amount of light passing through the water is drastically decreased, which stops photosynthesis activity. Also, they
diminish the oxygen content in the water (causing damage
to aquatic life) and contribute to the proliferation of insects,
which could be a source for human diseases [35–37]. Several strategies have been implemented as an effort to reduce
the contamination produced by vinasses. Some strategies for the mitigation of contamination are: (1) Production of unicellular protein through aerobic fermentation, (2) production of
methane through anaerobic fermentation, (3) as a fertilizer for
agricultural production and (4) for the generation of electricity
after burning the organic elements in distillery-slop [38, 39].
All those strategies have demonstrated certain effectiveness to
decrease the contamination by vinasses, but their consumption
in agriculture or for energy generation is not high enough. In
addition, the construction of treatment plants to transform the
vinasses in value-added products such as biofuel or fertilizers
is very expensive [40]. Therefore, new alternatives should be
proposed for the use of vinasses at mass scale.
As an effort to eliminate from the environment the toxic
vinasses as well as to increase their mass consumption, we
developed in this work a carbon nanotube based solid-state
supercapacitor that employed an electrolyte made mainly
of vinasses (≈83%). The device was assembled with two
electrodes made of CNT sheets coated with Ag/TiO2 nanoparticles. The synthesis route of these nanoparticles and their
use to store charge in flexible supercapacitors has been previously reported [41]. The flexible device made with two electrodes of CNTs and an electrolyte of vinasse + H3PO4 presented a high capacitance of 679.7 F g−1 which increased up
to 1852.8 F g−1 when the Ag/TiO2 nanoparticles is added
in the anode electrode. This last value is among the highest
values reported so far for solid state supercapacitor made
CNTs and other compounds such as: MnO2 (393 F g−1
) [42],
PANI/TiO2 (472 F g−1
) [43] and Ca2.9Nd0.1Co4O9+δ perovskite (620.4 F g−1
) [44]. Surprisingly, the voltage of the
supercapacitors became stable after 400 min of continuous discharge, suggesting that the devices also have a battery-like
behavior. This stable output voltage increased from 0.26 V
to 0.87 V when the Ag/TiO2 nanoparticles are added in the
anode of the CNT SCs. This work demonstrates for the first
time that the mixture of vinasse + H3PO4 can be used as a
reliable electrolyte to store charge in supercapacitors. Our results could be used to design future batteries for cars, trucks etc,
which would employ vinasses as the main component of the
electrolyte instead of sulfuric acid, which is the most common
compound employed in high power batteries. Finally, this new
class of supercapacitor based on vinasses could be promising
to substitute the current technologies of Li batteries, which are
becoming expensive due to the continuous increment of costs
forthe rare Li material [45]."
323_Intro.txt,"In the background of the overconsumption of fossil fuels and
related environmental issues in modern society, the investigation of sustainable energy storage systems undergoes a highspeed development period, especially for the design of portable and wearable electronic devices [1, 2]. Compared to secondary battery systems, supercapacitors (SCs) have been
widely considered as an effective electrochemical energy storage system to remit the energy crisis due to their superior
power density, long lifespan, and rapid charging time [3].
However, their practical application is still impeded by the
relatively limited energy density caused by the low capacitance and narrow voltage window of the electrodes [4–6].
Constructing asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) by combining battery-type Faradic electrodes as energy sources and capacitive electrodes as power sources has been documented as
an effective strategy to expand the operating voltage and boost
the energy density [7, 8]. However, conventional ASCs mainly operate in aqueous electrolytes, suffering the inevitable solvent evaporation and harmful electrolyte leakage [9, 10]. In
contrast, solid ASCs (SASCs) with the binder-free flexible
electrode and gel electrolyte are preferred device configurations to avoid the shortcomings and meet the requirements of
flexibility, lightweight, wear resistance, and high mechanical
integrity for portable and future electronic products [11–14].
Despite that the great progress of SASCs has been made, the
design and fabrication of high-energy SASC equipment without sacrificing its power density and working lifespan is of
great challenge. The delicate structural design and subsequent
surface modification of novel nanostructured electrode materials are highly desired.
Transition metal oxides (TMOs, especially multiple-metal
oxides) have attracted wide attention as advanced SASC electrodes owing to their attractive merits of low price, natural
abundance, high theoretical capacity, and environment benign [15–17]. Among them, mixed metal molybdates such as
NiMoO4 [18], CoMoO4 [19], and MnMoO4 [20] exhibit superior electrochemical performances than their singlecomponent counterparts due to their versatile oxidation state
and superior electrical conductivity [21]. Specifically, the outstanding electrochemical activity of Ni endows the versatile
redox reactions and abundant charge reserves in NiMoO4,
making it a promising candidate for high-performance
SASC electrodes [22, 23]. For instance, the free-standing
NiMoO4 nanosheet arrays on carbon nanofiber (CNF) as the
positive electrode in an ASC can deliver a high energy density
of 44.4 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 800 W kg−1 [21].
However, the current-stage NiMoO4-based electrodes are still
subjected to poor conductivity, sluggish charge transport, and
limited electrochemically active sites [18].
Incorporation of anion doping or rich oxygen defects into
bimetallic oxide electrodes is an underlying strategy to increase the intrinsic electronic conductivity and active sites
[24–26]. Recently, the fluorine (F) dopant has been confirmed
to boost the supercapacitive properties of Co2MnO4, delivering a high specific capacity of 204 mAh g−1
. And the density
functional theory (DFT) calculation revealed that the F dopants can decrease the band gaps of Co2MnO4 to enhance the
electronic conductivity and are beneficial to create low valence states of Mn2+ and Co2+ ions, thus enabling rapid reaction kinetics [27]. Moreover, the highly ionic nature of the MF bonds could expand the redox potential and increase energy
density [28]. On the other hand, the oxygen vacancies in metal
oxides can effectively adjust their electronic properties and
subtly induce impurity states in its bandgaps to significantly
improve their electrochemical performances [29]. For example, Wu et al. [30] proposed that O vacancy–enriched MoO3-x
nanobelts can efficiently increase the concentration of the carrier, contributing to improved electrical conductivity and accelerated reaction kinetics than the fully oxidized MoO3, and
attain an excellent specific capacitance of 1230 F g−1 at 5 A
g−1
. Therefore, integrating the advantages of F heteroatoms
and O vacancy into TMOs is expected to achieve outstanding
electrochemical performances, but the fabrication of novel
electrodes is still very challenging.
Here, we report an effective synergistic engineering strategy to promote the performance of F-NiMoO4-x nanosheets
grown on carbon fiber cloth (CFC) by introducing F dopant
and creating O vacancy. A series of flexible NiMoO4-based
electrodes were prepared by controlling the F dopant and
modulating the O vacancies in the NiMoO4-x to reveal the
synergistic effects on the performances of electrodes. The obtained results disclosed that the dopant F, which existed as
NiF2 in NiMoO4, not only regulates the uniform growth of
NiMoO4 nanosheets on CFC but also promotes the electrode
kinetics. The O vacancies further improve the electrical conductivity and redox process. Thus, the obtained F-doped and
O-deficient F-NiMoO4-x electrode delivers excellent areal
capacitance (2.45 F cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2
) and outstanding cycle
stability (94% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles).
Moreover, the assembled flexible solid ASC device (FNiMoO4-x//AC) yields a wide voltage window of 1.8 V and
an impressive energy density of 336.5 μWh cm−2 (50.9 Wh
kg−1
) at a power density of 1790 μW cm−2 (264.8 W kg−1
). In
addition, the device retains 85.7% of the initial areal capacitance at 25 mA cm−2 over 10,000 cycles and can also work at
various bending angles"
324_Intro.txt,"Ni and Ni oxide composite materials, possessing the merits of
earth-abundance, low cost, and easy processing, have been widely
studied in diverse fields, such as bio-medicine [1], bio-sensing [2],
electronics [3], energy storage [4,5], magnetics [6], and optics [7].
Ni/NiO nanocomposites in the structures of zero to three
dimensions have been reported and the fabrication strategies are
generally divided into two categories: (a) self-conversion: building
up a nanostructured Ni followed by oxidation treatment to the
surface, or conversely, partially reducing a nanostructured Ni oxide
in a reductive environment; (b) external introduction: deposition of
nanostructured Ni oxides on Ni metal substrates (e.g., Ni foams).
Particularly in energy storage, Ni/NiO nanocomposites not only
exhibit excellent capacity, cycling stability, and rate capability as
anodes of lithium-ion batteries [5,8], but also offer superior specific
capacitance, cycling stability, power and energy densities as
supercapacitor electrodes [4,9]. Supercapacitors bridge the gap
between conventional capacitors and rechargeable batteries. They
simultaneously exhibit rapid charging-discharging and battery-like
high electrical capacitance. Typically, for a Ni/NiO supercapacitor
electrode operated in an alkaline electrolyte, fast and reversible redox reactions occur via the equation: NiIIO þ OH 4
NiIIIOOH þ e. That is, in the charging state, OH anions are
absorbed and intercalated in the crystal lattice of surface NiO to
temporarily form a thin layer of NiOOH and charge (electrical energy) is stored. While in the discharging state, NiOOH is reduced to
NiO with deintercalation of OH anions and the charge (electrical
energy) is released [10]. A majority of reported Ni/NiO supercapacitor electrodes undergo capacitance decay after large
numbers of charging-discharging cycles. It is explained by that, on
one hand, repeated intercalation-deintercalation of OH anions
leads to a breaking of the NiO crystal structure, and on the other
hand, the Ni backbone may be gradually oxidized and this results in
a weakened mass transport [11,12]. However, as observed in some
recent publications, capacitances of Ni/NiO supercapacitors increase with continuous charging-discharging up to thousands of
cycles [9,13e17]. Therefore, influential factors for the cycle life of a
supercapacitor electrode are complicated. The full picture of the
cyclic charging-discharging process, including electrolyteelectrode interaction and electrode structure variation, is yet to
be comprehended by experiment [9,18].
Neutron reflectometry (NR), often combined with X-ray reflectometry (XRR), is a mature technique for studying thin films and
multi-layer interfaces, such as in inorganic magnetic materials [19],
polymers [20], and bio-membranes [21]. The method takes
advantage of the neutrons’ strong material penetration capability,
sub-angstrom resolution in thickness, and high light-element
sensitivity. NR measures the reflectivity of a neutron beam at
small scattering angles as a function of the scattering vector Q. For a
specular reflected neutron beam, Q is directed perpendicular to the
sample surface, and its magnitude is expressed as follows:
Q ¼ 4psinq/l, where q is the reflection angle and l is the wavelength of the incident neutron beam. An analysis of a polarized
neutron reflectometry (PNR) experiment will reveal the chemical
and magnetic depth-profile of a thin film along the surface normal
direction, (i.e., in the direction of Q), by determining the depthdependence of the local in-plane averaged scattering length density (SLD), the latter being a measure of the material’s scattering
ability [22e24]. The nuclear SLD of a given volume-element is the
product of the bound coherent scattering length bnuc of a given
isotope and the atomic density N of that isotope within the volumeelement. If the material is made up of several elemental isotopes,
the total SLD is the sum of the individual isotopic SLDs. In addition,
if the volume-element carries a net magnetic moment, then a
magnetic SLD will also result, which is proportional to the magnetic
scattering length ± bmag. The “±” symbol applies when the polarization direction of the incident neutron beam is oriented parallel
(spin up (Rþ)) or antiparallel (spin down (R-)) to the magnetizing
sample field. The total local neutron SLD is, therefore, given by:
SLDtotal ¼ SLDtotal nuc ± SLDtotal mag ¼ (bnuc 1 ± bmag 1)  N1 þ (bnuc
2 ± bmag 2)  N2 … [25,26]. X-ray reflectometry (XRR) is conceptually very similar to NR, however, because X-rays interact with the
electron clouds of atoms, X-ray SLDs scale with the local electron
density as bX-ray ¼ re  f1, where re is the classical electron radius
and f1 is the real part of the atomic scattering factor [27,28]. As a
result, XRR is particularly powerful for investigating interfaces
between light and heavy materials, but lacks sensitivity to detect
interfacial details between layers which have similar electron
concentrations. In contrast to NR, magnetic scattering is very weak
in XRR and can usually be omitted [27e29]. In electrochemistry, NR
has been utilized not only for fundamental research into transition
metal oxides [30] and conducting polymers [31], but also into
lithium-ion batteries, particularly in aspects of solid electrolyte
interphase formation [32,33], lithiation of amorphous silicon
electrodes [34,35], and lithium permeation through Si [36,37].
Studies of supercapacitors using NR or XRR are limited, despite the
great potential to undertake in situ monitoring of layer changes of
electrode materials, and to reveal details of electrochemical reactions at interfaces [38].
In the present study, we simplify the Ni/NiO supercapacitor
electrode into a layered Ni/NiOx model, and study its cyclic
charging-discharging properties in a deuteroxide (D2O)-based sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution electrolyte, via the combination of
in situ PNR and ex situ XRR techniques. Owing to the great penetration capability of neutron beams (here through the Si substrate),
PNR measurements can be performed in situ, which is not possible
using a comparable X-ray based reflectometry experimental setup.
The electrolyte-electrode interaction and associated structural and
compositional changes at the electrode, can therefore be monitored
directly, while unnecessary adverse effects resulting from sample
cleaning procedures, electrolytic cell assembly, etc. are eliminated.
For the particular case of Ni/NiO, it is difficult to pinpoint possible
charging-discharging induced layer and interface changes by XRR
or standard unpolarized NR, because bulk Ni and NiO have very
similar structural SLD values for both X-rays and neutrons (Ni:
9.414  106 Å2 for NR and 6.44  105 Å2 for XRR; NiO:
8.66  106 Å2 for NR and 4.82  105 Å2 for XRR). Therefore,
PNR is applied in our study. Since Ni is ferromagnetic (bulk: 0.60 mB
per Ni atom at 298 K resulting in a total SLD of 10.87  106 Å2 for
spin up neutrons and 7.94  106 Å2 for spin down neutrons), and
NiO is antiferromagnetic (nil net magnetic moment resulting in nil
magnetic SLD), distinctly different PNR patterns can be expected for
spin-up (Rþ) and spin-down (R) polarized neutron beams. The
ferromagnetism of the Ni layer induces neutron spin up/down
scattering contrast to identify not only the density of the Ni layer,
but also its net magnetization. Consistent refinement of PNR and
XRR data allows to identify the density and composition profiles of
the layered system with higher precision. This allows, for the case of
PNR, the extraction of both chemical (nuclear) SLD and magnetic
SLD profiles as a function of sample depth, and, using the same set
of structural parameters in the analysis of the XRR data, the
chemical (electronic) SLD depth profile is extracted. As such, during
the charging-discharging process, the degradation of the Ni/NiOx
electrode is measured; moreover, the structural and compositional
variations within the NiOx layer are monitored."
325_Intro.txt,"Supercapacitors (SCs) as a potential energy storage device between 
batteries and traditional capacitor with the advantages of fast charging/ 
discharging speed and long life and high power density, which have 
broad application prospects, such as portable equipment, data storage 
system, electric vehicle power supply and emergency backup power 
supply, etc. [1–12]. Electrode materials are one of most critical components to determine the performance of SCs [13–21]. Various 
transition-metal oxides like Co3O4, RuO2 and MnO2 exhibit prominent 
specific capacitance, which have been supposed as predominant materials for developing of SCs with excellent performance [22–32]. Among 
them, MnO2 has attracted much attention for the reasons of its high 
theoretical specific capacitance, easy approach for preparing, multiplex 
oxidation valences, inexpensive, plentiful abundance and nontoxicity 
[1]. However, the inferior conductivity and poor structural stability of 
MnO2 lead to low specific capacitance and poor cycle stability [33]. 
To improve above mentioned deficiencies, presently, combining 
MnO2 nanostructures with outstandingly conductive materials is one of 
the most common solution [34–36]. For example, Zhou et al. used 
electrodeposition method to prepare the composite of porous network 
MnO2/poly (5-cyanoindole) at 8.3 A g− 1 up to 322.5 F g− 1
, yet the total 
capacitance loss was 28.3% after 1000 cycles [37]. Yao et al. reported 
that at 2 mV s
− 1 the specific capacitance of MnO2@polypyrrole coaxial 
nanotubes was 346 F g− 1
, but the total capacitance loss was 10% after 
1000 cycles [38]. Mohammadi et al. reported that defective mesoporous 
carbon/MnO2 nanocomposite at 0.5 A g− 1 showed 292 F g− 1
, yet the 
total capacitance loss of 21% after 2000 cycles [39]. Although the 
conductivity of the MnO2 can be increased by introducing additional 
conductive components, the enhancement of the electrochemical properties is still limited due to this type of composites are greatly affected by 
the interfacial properties of the two phases [40]. Moreover, because the 
MnO2 nanostructures are coated on the outer surface of various 
conductive carriers, the instability of bulk MnO2 in continuous electrochemical cycles still exists [41]. 
Metal doping into MnO2 is an alternative strategy to achieve high-performance electrode materials due to metal doping can create uniform 
oxygen vacancies from the bulk to surface, change electronic structure, 
increase layer spacing, and establish highly active redox sites [42–44]. 
In the meantime, oxygen vacancies also can adjust the structure of 
electronic band and facilitate the rapid transfer of charge [45,46]. 
Therefore, metal doping into MnO2 will markedly enhance the intrinsic 
conductivity, the capacity of ion transport, structural stability and SCs 
performance. For instance, Lan et al. reported that at 1 A g− 1 the specific 
capacitance of Sn-doped MnO2 nano-flowers reached 243.6 F g− 1
, and 
after 10,000 cycles the capacitance retention was 95% [47]. Kim et al. 
showed a specific capacitance of Co-doped MnO2 at 1 A g− 1 about 250 F 
g− 1 and 97.3% of cycling stability after 5000 cycles [48]. Mondal et al. 
covered that the Cu-doped a-MnO2 nanosphere at 0.5 A g− 1 had 
capacitance value of 334.2 F g− 1 and 96% charge retentivity after 2000 
cycles [49]. Unusual other elements of metal, the rare earth (RE) elements equip large ion radius, low electronegativity, peculiar outer layer 
4f electronic structure, etc., and the RE element doping can modulate 
the electronic configurations of inorganic nanomaterials, morphologies, 
crystallographic phases, sizes and endowing materials with new properties [50,51]. In recent years, RE-doped metal oxides have drawn 
attention for SCs electrode materials [52]. For instance, Shao et al. 
attained a high specific capacitance of 382.38 F g− 1 for Ce-doped MnO2 
[53]. Zhou and coworkers reported that Ce-doped MoO3 ultrathin 
nanoflakes with oxygen vacancy showed extraordinary specific capacitance of 1446 F g− 1 and superb capacitance retention [51]. As the most 
active element of rare earth, Eu has the ground state valence of 4f7
6s2
. In 
addition losing two 6s electrons to form Eu2+, it also can lose one 4f 
electron to generate paramagnetic Eu3+ [50]. The Eu3+ doping in ZnO, 
MoO3 and TiO2 have been proved to promote the structural stability and 
photocatalytic activity [54–56]. In terms of SCs performance, there are 
few reports on Eu doped electrode materials, including Eu-doped MnO3 
[57]. Eu-doped CaTiO3 [58]. and Eu-doped Fe3O4 nanoparticles [59]. 
However, as far as we know, the Eu-doped MnO2 for SCs electrode 
materials has not been reported. 
In this paper, we prepared Eu-MnO2 ultrathin nanosheets with oxygen vacancies through the creation of impurity energy levels within the 
band gap by chemical redox co-precipitation procedure. This synthesis 
method is simple, low cost, time-saving, and batch production compared 
with other methods such as hydrothermal process, sol gel method, high 
temperature (thermal) ion implantation etc. Through detailed characterization, it is found that Eu doping not only improves the electronic 
conductivity of MnO2 but also reduces the thickness of MnO2 nanosheets. Moreover, the specific capacitance of the optimized Eu5%-MnO2 
nanosheets at 1 A g− 1 reaches 361.2 F g− 1
, outbalancing MnO2 nanosheets (198 F g− 1
). The assembled asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) 
with Eu5%-MnO2 as cathode and active carbon (AC) as anode shows a 
high energy density of 19.8 Wh kg− 1 at a power density of 373.2 W kg− 1
. 
Insights into the structure activity relationships of Eu-MnO2 nanosheets 
are also discussed, which will help researchers gain a good understanding of Eu-MnO2 nanosheets and also further promote their development in SCs.  "
326_Intro.txt,"With the rapid development of flexible wearable electronics in 
the commercial market, there has been an increasing demand for 
high-performance and multifunctional characteristics in the field of 
flexible energy storage devices [1–4]. Among the diverse flexible 
energy storage devices, flexible asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) 
have aroused extensive concerns due to their broader voltage 
window compared to symmetric supercapacitors [5–7]. ASCs usually 
composed of two electrode materials with distinct charge storage 
mechanisms, e.g., a pseudocapacitive electrode and a double-layer 
capacitive electrode with complementary voltage windows [8–10]. 
Therefore, exploiting appropriate electrode becomes the prerequisite for designing flexible asymmetric supercapacitor with desirable electrochemical performance.
Manganese dioxide (MnO2) with various polymorphs is intensively explored as the positive electrode materials for ASCs on 
account of their various crystal structures, variable Mn oxidation 
states, outstanding theoretical specific capacitance (1370 F g−1), and 
broad potential windows ∼1 V in the aqueous electrolyte [11]. Recently, ε-MnO2, which derives from the ramsdellite structure, spring 
up as a promising catalyst for rechargeable batteries [12–15]. Like γMnO2, the tunnel-like structure of ε-MnO2 can serve as energy storage site, which renders it a decent candidate for electrodes of supercapacitors. However, the capacitive performance of ε-MnO2 
remained rarely explored, limited existing studies show that the 
capacitive performance of ε-MnO2-based supercapacitor is not very 
excellent because of the low electron transfer efficiency and underutilized electrochemically active sites, which impede their potential application in high-performance supercapacitors [16–20]. 
Furthermore, the energy density of the most assembled flexible ASCs 
based on the ε-MnO2 electrode is far below expected, leading to poor 
application satisfaction because of the low practical capacitance and frustrating structural collapse during the repetitive charging/discharging process [18].
Strategies such as doping with heteroatoms [21], modifying with 
highly conductive compound [22], and inducing oxygen vacancies 
[23] have been investigated to create more electrochemically active 
sites for better capacitive performance and to ensure the structural 
integrity of MnO2-based electrodes. Among these methods, introducing of oxygen vacancies has attracted broad attention to 
achieve the favorable electrochemical performance of MnO2 [24]. 
These oxygen vacancies can adjust the electronic configuration and 
accelerate the charge transfer, consequently optimizing the electrochemical performance of the MnO2 [25]. Besides, recent studies 
on amorphous or low-crystalline transition metal oxides/hydroxides 
have verified that low crystalline transition metal oxide/hydroxides 
deliver better capacitive performances than their high crystalline 
counterpart because of the abundant structural defects and disorder 
[26–29]. The low-crystalline structure of metal oxides with intrinsically isotropic behavior can effectively accommodate the strain 
caused by volume changes and thus improve the structural collapse 
of the electrode material during long-term cycling [30]. Up to now, 
many approaches, such as thermal treatment, chemical reduction, 
N2-plasma treatment, etc., have been used to introduce oxygen vacancies or to fabricate low-crystalline MnO2 [24,31,32]. However, the 
conditions of these methods are relatively complicated to control. 
Therefore, there is still a challenging to design a simple way to 
prepare oxygen-defective MnO2 with low-crystallinity.
Recently, carbon quantum dots (CQDs) have gained increasing 
attention as electroactive electrode materials because of their unique physicochemical properties [33,34]. Previous literature reports 
have confirmed that CQDs can improve the electrical conductivity of 
electrode and supply abundant active sites for charge transport 
during charge-discharge processes, resulting in the enhancement of 
the electrochemical performance of electrode [35,36], in which CQDs 
can serve as a structure-directing agent for the assembly of functional micro/nanomaterials due to the quantum confinement and 
edge effect [37–39]. However, there are very few reports about CQDs 
being utilized as an inducer to induce low crystallinity in electrode 
material.
Herein, CQDs were in-situ immobilized into ε-MnO2 by one-step 
electrodeposition to enhance the capacitive performance while 
holding the structural integrity of the ε-MnO2 electrode. Owing to 
their unique physicochemical properties, CQDs can play a dual role 
as structural stabilizer and inducer, which can effectively increase 
oxygen vacancies and induce low crystallinity in ε-MnO2. On the one 
hand, CQDs acted as structural stabilizer to stabilize the original 
structure of ε-MnO2 through the formation of strong interfacial 
bonding between ε-MnO2 and carbon cloth by the abundant functional groups on the surface of CQDs, and finally obtain the robust 
electrodes with good mechanical properties. On the other hand, 
CQDs can induce low-crystalline ε-MnO2, the presence of structural 
disorder can significantly increase efficient active sites and promote 
active site exposure for energy storage. The obtained CQDs/ε-MnO2 
composites were uniformly grown on the skeletons of carbon cloth, 
and the corresponding electrode was designated as CQDs/ε-MnO2. 
This structure maintains structure continuity of the ε-MnO2, enables 
the maximum utilization of electrochemically active sites and sufficient electron transfer efficiency by providing direct contact between CQDs/ε-MnO2 and carbon cloth, which is essential for 
excellent electrochemical performance. The as-prepared CQDs/εMnO2 electrode yields improved specific capacitance of 334.5 F g−1 
at 1 A g−1, while maintaining remarkable rate capability and long 
cycling stability (with 90% of capacitance retention after 6000 
cycles), which is superior to that of pristine ε-MnO2. The characteristics of low-crystalline and rich oxygen vacancies of CQDs/εMnO2 electrode ensure adequate pseudocapacitive reaction active 
sites. The structural stabilizing effect of CQDs not only stabilizes the 
original structure of CQDs/ε-MnO2, but also buffers the large volume 
variation of ε-MnO2 during the repetitive charging/discharging 
process. Moreover, a flexible asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) based 
on the CQDs/ε-MnO2 electrode shows an energy density up to 
68.2 Wh kg−1 and outstanding cycle stability with 96.5% retention 
after 6 000 cycles. These results demonstrate an instructive route to 
achieving oxygen defect and low crystallinity for high-performance 
advanced electrode materials for flexible energy storage devices."
327_Intro.txt,"Among kinds of compound oxides, the perovskite-type ceramic
with unique ABO3 structure[1] can provide various excellent
properties, such as dielectric, piezoelectric and ion transport
properties,[2] which lead to its wide application in different
fields. Due to the outstanding ion transport capability, the
perovskite-type composite oxides have been applied to develop
different energy storage devices, for instance, as cathode
materials for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) or as solid electrolyte
materials for Li-ion battery.[3] The previous researches show that
ion transport property of oxides causing by the adsorption and
diffusion of oxygen can be promoted by additional oxygen
vacancies, indicating the ability of oxygen vacancy for charge
storage.[4] In particular, a novel oxygen intercalation mechanism
proposed by Mefford’s group has further demonstrated that the
perovskite composite oxides can store charge through its own
oxygen vacancies.[5] Based on this principal, these oxides
possessed well energy storage performance through pseudocapacitance can show high specific capacitance (Cs), wide
voltage window, good cycling stability and high environmental
resilience.[6] However, these composite oxides materials suffer
from their natural rigidity, resulting in inability to meet the
demand of flexible and wearable energy storage device.[7]
Although some papers have reported the application of
composite oxides materials in flexible electrodes,[8] these studies
mostly focus on the inorganic/polymer nanocomposite films[9]
or flexible electrodes prepared by coating oxide powder on the
current collector.[10] However, these fabrication approaches
would limit the electrochemical performance of perovskite-type
oxides owing to their finite contents in active materials. To
solve this problem and expand their application in flexible
energy storage field, the synthesis of oxides films with good
softness is regarded as a feasible solution.
So far, various flexible self-supporting oxides films[11] with
pyrochlore[12] or fluorite[13] structures have been synthetized and
used as electrode active materials. And the results confirm that
energy storage efficiency of the flexible devices can be
significantly improved by these flexible composite oxides. For example, Cao et al.[14] have successfully synthesized a series of
pyrochlore-type La2YxZr2-xO3 flexible self-supporting films (LNFx) as electrode materials by electrospinning combined with
calcination method. With an appropriate Y content, the sample
has developed a high areal capacitance of 605.3 mF· cm-1"
328_Intro.txt,"The demand for clean energy has gained greater interest as
the energy generated from conventional fuels releases toxic
gases which shows severe environmental impact that indirectly affects the standard of living [1,2]. To overcome this
drawback, making use of renewable energy resources is a
suitable choice of interest as it is environmentally benign and
abundantly available. However, the availability of such energy resources is intermittent which requires some efficient
energy storage and conversion devices [3,5]. The success of
those efficient energy devices depends on the utilization of
promising electrode materials with excellent electrochemical
properties which has gained extensive interest in the current
arena of research. Supercapacitors also called electrochemical capacitors (ECs) are one among the energy storage
devices that are being used in electric vehicles (EVs), portable
devices because of their high power density, high specific
capacitance, simple mechanism of charge storage, rapid
charging rate and high stability during its performance for
numerous number of cycles [4e7]. Based on the charge storage mechanism, supercapacitors are designated as electrical
double-layer capacitance (EDLCs) or pseudocapacitors. EDLCs
conserve the charges across the interface of electrode and
electrolyte either by diffusion or charge accumulation process.However, in pseudocapacitors, the charges are conserved
through Faradaic processes thus revealing higher specific
capacitance (SC) than that of EDLCs [8e10]. Nonetheless, the
energy density is not till attained the requirement of
increasing demand for practical applications. To date, various
types of electrode materials based on single metal oxides
such as V2O5 [11], MnO2 [12], MoO3 [14], and WO3 [13], bimetallic oxides based on conversion-type (NiFe2O4 [16], ZnFe2O4
[17], MnNi2O4 [15], etc.) and intercalation-type (LiCoO2,
LiMn2O4, etc.), metal oxide/carbon composites, the different
combination of transition metals modified with conducting
polymers and carbon materials have extensively investigated. Similarly, hydrogen production by water electrolysis
process is a facile and eco-friendly approach that requires an
efficient electrocatalyst for catalyzing oxygen evolution and
hydrogen evolution reaction. Nevertheless, HER is a simple
process compared to OER which is a complicated multi-step
process. To vitalize this reaction, IrO2 and RuO2 was a
strongly proved efficient candidate, however high cost and
scarcity has lead to discovering an alternative electrocatalyst
which is of inexpensive and abundantly available. Transition
metal-based catalysts have revealed outstanding performance in catalyzing OER and in this regard, the efficacy of the
prepared electrocatalysts towards OER and the electrochemical performance for supercapacitor application was
briefly investigated.
Transition metal oxides exhibiting spinel structure (AB2O4)
with divalent A cations occupying the tetrahedral sites and
trivalent B cations residing in the octahedral sites demonstrate outstanding electrochemical properties with elevated
specific capacitance due to the presence of various oxidation
states [18]. But they suffer from poor electron conductivity
owing to its small surface area and aggregation when reduced
to nanoscale [19] which results in poor electrochemical
performance and poor stability during cycling for a longer
period [20]. However, exploring it with some carbon rich materials such as carbon nanotubes, graphene, g-C3N4, activated
carbon and various conducting polymers was a suitable path
to enhance the conductivity [42], capacitive behavior of spinel
oxides [18].
In recent times, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has to
emerge as a promising material owing to its considerable
surface area, good chemical stability and excellent surface
properties suitable for optical applications. It is a two
dimensional CeN rich polymeric material composed of tri-striazine bonding without electron localization and due to the
existence of pristine hydrogen impurities at the edges makes
it a promising material for catalysis [21]. The existence of a
large amount of nitrogen helps in elevating the electron-donor
property of the carbon skeleton which enhances the electron
transport suitable for Faradaic reactions [27]. However, the
utilization of pristine g-C3N4 as an electrode material for
supercapacitors is greatly limited due to poor conductivity
and easy recombination of charge carriers [22]. Hence intercalation of g-C3N4 with transition metals helps in the significant improvement of structural characteristics and thereby it
helps in the enhancement of the specific capacitance. In
addition, intercalation of g-C3N4 with metal species the
bridged C and N atoms get delocalized and this delocalized p
bonding significantly helps in improving the electron transfer
[23].
This work mainly focuses on the development of Ni
substituted MnCo2O4 intercalated with g-C3N4 (Mn0$4Ni0$6-
Co2O4/g-C3N4) by simple hydrothermal technique. Initially, gC3N4 is prepared from melamine using thermal condensation
technique and the intercalation of Mn0$4Ni0$6Co2O4 with gC3N4 is carried out by hydrothermal technique and subsequently calcining in an inert atmosphere. The prepared materials were intensely investigated towards OER
electrocatalysis and as an electrode material for supercapacitor. It was clearly evident that Mn0$4Ni0$6Co2O4/g-C3N4
delivered an outstanding response in favor of evolving oxygen
molecules efficiently with low overpotential. Moreover, as an
electrode material for supercapacitor, it revealed a high specific capacitance of 1987.2 F/g at 1 A/g and good cycling
durability with the retention of a specific capacitance value of
1922 F/g even after 8000 cycles which is worthier than
MnCo2O4/g-C3N4 and pristine g-C3N4. This outcome indicates
that Mn0$4Ni0$6Co2O4/g-C3N4 substitution of Ni cation within
MnCo2O4 spinel and the intercalation of C,N rich g-C3N4 substantially enhanced the capacitive behavior and maximum
retention of specific capacitance even after the cycling for
8000 times "
329_Intro.txt,"Due to the excessive consumption of traditional energy and environmental pollution, the development and utilization of new energy has 
become a urgent demand [1]. Energy conversion and storage technology 
can effectively alleviate the instability and poor sustainability of green 
energy [2]. The lithium ion hybrid supercapacitor (HSC), with the advantages of both battery and supercapacitor, is expected to be a new 
generation of energy storage equipment [3,4]. It has been reported that 
HSC has high energy density, power density and cycle stability [5,6]. 
However, the dynamic imbalance between its two electrodes (Faraday 
reaction and non-Faraday reaction) is the main challenge to limit its 
performance [7]. Therefore, the development of reversible and rapid ion 
embedded/de-embedded anode materials suitable for HSC is key to its 
application [8]. 
Niobium-titanium oxide systems (such as TiNb2O7, [9] TiNb24O62 
[10]and Ti2Nb10O29 [11]) with good ion transport properties present 
good potential as next generation high-performance HSC anode materials [12]. Compared with TiO2 [13] and Nb2O5 [14], Ti2Nb10O29 (TNO) 
shows larger theoretical capacity (396 mAh/g) because of multi-electron 
pair reaction (including Ti3+/Ti4+, Nb3+/Nb4+ and Nb4+/Nb5+) [15]. 
Meanwhile, its high reversible phase transition and safe working voltage 
platform (1.0 ~ 2.0 V) avoid the decomposition voltage of electrolytes 
(<0.8 V) and lithium dendrite growth voltage range (<0.2 V), thus 
ensuring structure stability and safety under large current density [16]. 
Moreover, TNO, with monoclinic ReO3 crystal structure composed of 4 
× 3 octahedrons and higher openness than spinel structure (such as 
Li4Ti5O12), can maintain large ionic diffusion coefficient [15]. 
Although the unique structural advantages, Ti2Nb10O29 also have 
some difficulties and shortcomings in its practical application: 1) Low 
ion/electron transport kinetics: In spite of the good ion transport rate, 
TNO is still incomparable to that of double layer capacitance [17]. The 
difference of ion transport rate between two electrodes restrains its full 
performance [18]. In addition, given the large band gap energy of Nb4d 
and Ti3d, the poor electrical conductivity also hinders its practical 
application [19]. 2) Unstable ion exchange at interface between TNO 
and electrolyte: Some adverse reactions occurrence between TNO and 
electrolyte is inevitable, such as the dissolution of some metal ions or 
irreversible phase transformation. Moreover, the introduction of lattice 
defects will also lead to partial lattice misalignment, thus causing more adverse reactions [20]. This process will largely reduce its cyclic stability and effective capacitance. 
In view of the above problems, this work intends to prepare 
ppy@TNO-x@NC as HSC anode material, with the biomass hollow carbon bowl as conductive matrix, Ti2Nb10O29-x nanoparticles with vacancy defects as energy storage main body, and polypyrrole (ppy, 
theoretical capacity of 64.5 mAh/g) as thin coating layer [21]. The 
material (ppy@TNO-x@NC) designed in this work has the following 
three advantages: 1) Conductive polymer coating (ppy) boosts the material surface stability—the physical properties, crystal structure and 
chemical properties of TNO shallow surface. For TNO, abundant Li+
impinged on the TNO crystal at the direct contact interface between 
TNO and electrolyte, destroying its structure and reducing chemical 
stability. Moreover, a series of side reactions between TNO and electrolyte are also inevitable, such as dissolution of metal ions. The ultrathin ppy layer can act as a protective interface for TNO to improve the 
energy storage stability of the shallow surface [22]. Moreover, its softness and self-healing properties mitigates volume expansion and TNO 
crushing [23]. In addition, ppy with rich functional groups and unique 
chain structure can stabilize the solid–liquid interface between electrode 
and electrolyte through inter-chain or intra-chain bond cooperation 
[21]. The ppy coating, being of appropriate thickness and structure, can 
lessen the direct contact between storage body and external electrolyte, 
and also promote the formation of a thin and strong SEI layer, thus 
improving Li+ flow uniformity and its embedding rate, which is beneficial to provide large power density and energy density in hybrid capacitors. 2) Vacancy defects in TNO effectively facilitate the electrical 
conductivity and ion transport rate. Vacancy defects enhance the 
openness of TNO crystal structure to build additional ion transport 
channels. The elevated ion accessibility is conducive to the activation 
and utilization of energy storage [24]. 3) Hollow carbon bowl as carbon 
matrix enlarge the electrical conductivity, and also alleviate the volume 
change of material during the charge/discharge process. Compared with 
the hollow sphere, the cavity carbon bowl structure offers more space 
utilization, enhancing the volume energy density [25]. In general, the 
carbon bowl, ppy coating and internal vacancy defects will integrate to 
accelerate the transmission dynamics (the comprehensive embodiment 
of the ions transport properties in the material lattice, such as rate, path, 
etc.) and cycle stability of Ti2Nb10O29. Resultantly, Li+ capacitor with 
ppy@Ti2Nb10O29-x@NC shows high reversible capacity, long cycle life 
and large volume energy density. "
330_Intro.txt,"As an emerging energy storage device between conventional 
capacitor and battery, supercapacitor (SCs) has been drawing increasing interest over the years and are widely applied in electric 
vehicles, portable electronics, intelligent power grids, etc [1–4]. 
Featuring higher voltage window, hybrid supercapacitors offer 
higher energy density than conventional electrochemical doublelayer capacitors and better power performance compared to lithiumion batteries, providing great promise for next-generation energy 
storage devices [5–7]. Transition metal oxides (TMOs), which are 
abundant on earth with low cost, possess great development potential and research value when used as battery-type electrode 
materials, due to larger capacity and excellent electrochemical reactivity [8–11]. Among various battery-type electrode materials, 
Co3O4 has attracted intense attention as a positive electrode for SCs 
due to its high theoretical specific capacitance, environmentally 
benign nature, low cost, and so on [12–15]. Nevertheless, the capacity of the recently reported Co3O4-based electrode materials is still 
far below their theoretical values (500 mAh g−1 by two-electron 
reaction) due to the restricted surface chemical reactivity and high 
internal resistance [16–19]. Therefore, a controlled and efficient 
engineering strategy is urgently needed to further break the capacitive performance of Co3O4-based electrode, but it remains a great 
challenge.
Recently, nanostructure engineering, especially 1D nanostructures constructed, including nanowires, nanofibers, nanorods, 
and nanotubes, has attracted significant interest for its features of 
optimizing electronic structure, increasing the number of active 
sites, and improving electrochemical properties [20–22]. Therefore, 
these materials are considered to possess great potential in energy 
storage systems. For example, Shakir and his collaborators prepared 
urchin-like hierarchical Co3O4/NF electrode assembled by Co3O4 
nanorod on the Ni-foam (NF), which serves as the binder-free electrode. The as-fabricated electrode showed a specific capacitance of 
848 F g−1 at the current density of 1 A g−1, a good rate capability 
(84.6% capacitance retention at 10 A g−1) and a superior cycling life (95.7% of the initial specific capacitance retained after 5000 CV tests) 
[23]. Shakir et al. reported synthesizing S-doped Co3O4 nanorods, 
which delivered an excellent electrochemical performance with the 
specific capacitance of 319.3 C g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 
and a high-rate capability of 83.3% with a 20-fold increase in current 
density (from 0.5 to 10 A g−1). Apart from that, the energy density 
and the power density of the device based on S-doped Co3O4 nanorods reach up to 38.1 Wh kg−1 and 8000 W kg−1, respectively [24]. 
Moreover, vacancy engineering, such as oxygen vacancies, can create 
midgap electronic states of electrodes to facilitate charge transfer. As 
a result, the electrical conductivity and electrochemical stability of 
SCs are improved [25]. However, the rational design and construction of 1D nanostructures with controllable compositions and 
oxygen vacancies are still challenging.
In this work, we designed a brand-new method to obtain Co3O4 
nanorods (NRs) based on elemental cobalt, through a simple hydrothermal reaction with the H2O2 solution, the cobalt NRs could be 
easily transformed into oxide cobalt under a special temperature 
while the original frame structures were well maintained. The obtained Co3O4 NRs displayed an enhanced areal supercapacitance of 
627.4 mF cm−2 at the current density of 0.5 mA cm−2, a great rate 
capacity of 57.8% capacitance retention at 10 mA cm−2, and longterm cycling stability of 85.7% capacitance retention over 5000 cycles at the current density of 20 mA cm−2. Furthermore, the asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC), with Co3O4 NRs being the positive 
electrode and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) hydrogel being the 
negative electrode, respectively, exhibits an energy density of 0.187 
mWh cm−2 at the power density of 1.261 mW cm−2. This work paved 
a new direction in addressing the challenges of choosing appropriate 
ASC electrodes.s"
331_Intro.txt,"As a promising next-generation energy storage device, 
supercapacitors have attracted widespread attention due to their highpower density, fast charge/discharge capacity, long-term stability and 
safety nature [1,2]. Based on the supercapacitors could be classified into faradic pseudocapacitors and 
electric double layer pseudocapacitors (EDLCs) [3]. The EDLCs are well 
known for their high-power density and long lifespan, and the primary 
active materials are carbonaceous materials such as carbon nanotubes 
(CNTs). CNTs can not only increase the contact area between electrode 
material and electrolyte, but also buffer volume change during charging/discharging processes [4]. However, EDLCs with low energy density hamper their widespread application. In contrast, the faradic 
pseudocapacitance refers to reversible Faradic redox reactions between 
electrode material and electrolyte ion to store energy [5], which usually 
exhibits excellent battery compatibility and high energy density. The 
active materials employed for this kind of electrodes are mainly transition metal oxide [6–9] and phosphide [10], among which, nanostructured Co3O4 has been widely studied due to its higher theoretical 
capacitance (3560 F g− 1
) and various available structure/morphologies 
[11–13]. However, the superiority of Co3O4 has not been fully realized 
due to its poor conductivity [14]. Therefore, combining CNTs with 
Co3O4 to form a composite should be a promising strategy to achieve 
high energy density, high electrical conductivity, and long-term cycle 
stability [15]. 
According to previous reports, the composite electrodes were 
conventionally prepared by drop-casting or paint-coating the active 
materials onto the current collectors with polymer binders. This can 
cover the active sites and reduce the conductivity, leading to a weakened 
capacitive performance. Alternatively, self-supporting binder-free electrodes have been developed for supercapacitors, which involve the 
direct growth of transition metal oxides on current collectors, such as Ni 
foam or carbon cloth [16]. It solves the problem of the shedding of active 
materials and reduces the contact resistance between the active materials and the current collectors, and thus enhancing the supercapacitor 
performance. For example, in situ growth of Co3O4 nanostructures on 
carbon cloth was conducted by hydrothermal reaction to improve the 
pseudocapacitive performances [17]. However, it is difficult to directly 
synthesize CNTs on Ni foam or carbon cloth. Recently, CNTs were 
organized onto Ni foam under mild condition by a self-assembly method 
[18]. Hu and co-workers prepared NiCoO2 onto CNTs film in-situ 
organized on Ni foam. The integrated electrode displayed significant 
enhancement in electrochemical performance as compared to NiCoO2@NF without CNTs [19]. 
In addition, the introduction of oxygen vacancy has been reported to 
effectively improve the electrochemical active sites and intrinsic conductivity of Co3O4, and thereby enhancing the supercapacitors performance [20]. Specifically, oxygen vacancies can serve as active reaction 
sites and electron carriers during the charging/discharging process, 
which accelerates Faradaic redox reaction, promotes electron/ion 
transport, and thus enhances the electrochemical performance [21]. 
Xiang and co-workers synthetized Co3O4 nanosheets with rich oxygen 
vacancies by treating the Co3O4 nanosheets with NaBH4, which 
exhibited a decreased charge transfer resistance and enhanced capacitance compared to Co3O4 without oxygen vacancies [20]. 
From the above, the supercapacitor performance of Co3O4 can be 
greatly enhanced by several strategies: the introduction of oxygen vacancy [20], the fabrication of Co3O4/CNTs composites [22], and the 
synthesis of binder-free electrodes with Co3O4 nanocomposites on Ni 
foam [23,24]. To our knowledge, few reported supercapacitor electrodes simultaneously satisfy all these strategies due to the limitation of 
synthesis conditions [25]. Therefore, it is essential to design a strategy to 
in-situ synthesize a self-supporting electrode with oxygen-vacancy 
abundant Co3O4/CNTs composites on NF. 
Herein, a rational route has been proposed to synthesize oxygenvacancy enriched Co3O4 nanowire/CNTs composites on NF. The direct 
assembly of CNTs and the in-situ growth of Co3O4 on NF solves the 
problem of low conductivity caused by the addition of binder. CNTs also 
endow the surface of Ni foam with plentiful conductive channels and 
excellent specific surface area. Moreover, the treatment of NaBH4 produces oxygen vacancies, which can serve as the active site during 
Faradaic redox reaction, and thus further boost the supercapacitor 
property of the composite. The Co3O4@CNTs@NF electrode exhibits 
excellent electrochemical capability, stability, and capacity retention, 
which can be attributed to the direct assembly of CNTs and in-situ 
growth of Co3O4 nanowires on Ni foam, the synergy effect between 
CNTs and Co3O4 nanowires, and the enriched oxygen vacancies.capacitance energy storage theory,"
332_Intro.txt,"Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are composed of the brucite-like host laminate with regulatable oxidized metal elements 
and the guest space with interlayer anions/water molecules, 
which is elaborated via the formular [X2+
1−yX3+
y(OH)2]
y+
(An−)y/n•mH2O.[1,2]
 The laminates can be feasibly modified, 
including the diverse metal elements regulation,[3,4]
 anion 
doping,[5,6]
 and defect modification.[7–9]
 These strategies could 
provide multiple oxidation state, enhance the electron aggregation ability, and adjust the bandgap energy, which can further obtain higher conductivity and capacitance. Although the 
design of laminates has been studied in electrochemical energy 
storage,[10–12]
 due to the laminates repel positive charges, there are great challenges to further stimulate 
the energy storage potential of LDHs 
through coordinated interlayer activity 
regulation.
Under the attraction of positive charge, 
the guest space can be easily compensated by anions.[13,14]
 The intercalation 
of these negatively charged groups can 
adjust the layer spacing of LDHs to promote the transmission efficiency of electrolyte ions and improve the capacitance 
performance.[15,16]
 Notably, the anion 
groups (SO4
2−, NO3
−, or Cl−) inserted 
into the interlayer of CoMn-LDH could 
exhibit the largest interlayer spacing of 
1.08  nm and increase the capacitance to 
the 582.07 mC cm−2
.
[17]
 Due to the lack of 
active sites in the interlayer gallery, it is 
difficult to improve charge density in the 
confined space.
In order to construct active units 
between LDHs layers, we selectively vulcanized the Co element on the laminate 
to form interlayer Co9S8 quantum dots 
(QDs). Compared with the original LDHs, the capacitance 
of this well-designed intercalation structure is improved to 
2504 F g−1
.
[18]
 Nevertheless, as the formation of QDs is derived 
from Co on the laminate rather than pre-embedded cations in 
the guest space, the interlayer spacing was not expanded and 
the active sites in the confined space are still very limited. It 
is noteworthy that LDHs activated in KOH solution can generate rich hydrogen vacancies (Hv) to reduce the charge repulsion between the laminates and cations, which can skillfully 
realize the insertion of metal ions (Li+, Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, 
and Zn2+) in the guest space.[13,19]
 Ideally, if the pre-embedded 
metal cations can be converted into QDs while the laminate is 
modified, it can effectively create new active sites in laminates 
and restricted spaces to improve the energy storage efficiency 
of LDHs.
We report here a synergistic energy storage effect composed of S-doped laminates and interlayer ZnS-QDs of CuCoLDH. During hydrothermal vulcanization, the pre-embedded 
Zn2+ was converted into ZnS-QDs and the layer spacing was 
expanded from 6.2 to 6.7 Å in the direction of (003) crystal plane. 
Meanwhile, sulfur replaced part of oxygen in the laminates and 
generated abundant oxygen vacancies. Moreover, as the copper 
is directly supplied by copper foam (Cu-Foam), the CuCo-LDHS/ZnS-QDs present a superstable 3D self-supporting structure. The nanoarrays deliver an ultrahigh capacitance of 7.82 F cm−2
at 2  mA  cm−2. Significantly, the as-assembled hybrid supercapacitors display an outstanding energy density of 299 µWh cm−2
at power density of 1600 µW cm−2
, with excellent capacity retention of 102.3% and coulomb efficiency of 96.2% after 10000 
charge–discharge cycles. The high-rate and stable energy 
storage efficiency is superior to the reported self-supporting 
electrode materials and it is the result of many factors. First, 
the ZnS-QDs expand the layer spacing and increase the active 
sites in the confined space, which not only improves the electron/ion transport efficiency, but also enhances the local charge 
density in the redox process. Then, S-doping can improve the 
conductivity and induce rich oxygen defects with enhanced 
OH− adsorption on laminates to increase surface charge density. Furthermore, the complete retention of lamellar and the 
design of 3D macrostructure make the electrode materials have 
ultra-high stability. Therefore, realizing the dual-regulation of 
the laminate and guest space is of great significance for developing the potential of LDHs in energy storage."
333_Intro.txt,"With the gradually rigorous of fossil fuel depletion and environmental pollution, a lot of work has been done on exploring novel 
renewable energy material and energy conversion technologies [1–3]. In 
particular, supercapacitors, which combine the advantages of high energy density for lithium-ion batteries and high power density for traditional capacitors, have shown great application prospects in energy 
storage fields [4,5]. 
Among various potential electrode materials of supercapacitors, 
perovskite-type (ABX3)-based electrodes have attracted wide attentions 
on account of the special anion intercalation mechanism, excellent 
reversibility, large potential window and good rate characteristics [6,7, 
8]. Perovskites exhibit great structural compatibility to regulate the 
electrochemical behavior by modifying A and/or B site cations. A site 
cations are mainly rare earth ions (La3+, Ce3+, etc.) or bivalent alkaline 
earth metal ions (Sr2+, Ca2+ or Ba2+), which affect the electronic 
structure and thermodynamic stability [9,10]. And B sites are transition 
metal ions (Mn, Co, Ni, etc.) with variable oxidation states, which 
directly correlate to the electrochemical properties [11,12]. Thereinto, 
strontium-based perovskite oxides SrBO3 (B = Ru, Co, Mn, Ti, etc.) have 
attracted extensive attentions as supercapacitors electrode materials 
[13–16]. It has been reporterd that B-site substitution is beneficial to 
maintain the phase stability and generate more oxygen vacancies for 
SrBO3 perovskites [17,18]. Gibin George and his partners investigated 
the effects of Ba, Ca, Co, Fe, Ni substitutions on the structure and 
property of SrMnO3 and concluded that SrMnO3 substituted with 20% 
Ba achieves capacitance to 446.8 F g− 1
, which is higher than that of 
SrMnO3 (321.7 F g− 1
) [19]. Moreover, Lei Na et al. optimized the electrochemical performances of SrMnO3 and SrCoO3 by introducing Nb in B 
site and increased Cs values to 190 mF cm− 2 and 894 mF cm− 2 respectively [20]. In short, various researches aimed to improve the electrochemical proprties of perovskites as supercapacitor positive electrodes 
have been carried out [21,22], but research about using perovskites as negative electrode materials is rarely reported. 
Fe-based perovskite-type oxide SrFeO3-δ shows many advantages 
such as natural abundance, high ionic/electronic conductivity and 
satisfactory thermodynamic stability. SrFeO3-δ has been thoroughly 
studied in the fields of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC), oxygen permeation 
membranes, electrocatalysis and oxygen sensors recently. [23–26]. 
However, SrFeO3-δ has rarely been applied in supercapacitors because of 
the structural vulnerability and poor cyclic stability. Duan et al. [27] 
found that Zr substitution in B site increased both oxygen ion mobility 
and phase stability of BaCo0.4Fe0.4Zr0.1Y0.1O3− δ, and it was applied as a 
new cathode for solid-oxide fuel cells at low temperature. Also, Zr 
substituted NdBaFe2O6-δ (NBF-Zr) material was designed as SOFC 
cathode by Sun et al.. [28] NBF-Zr with highly concentrated oxygen 
vacancy shows higher oxygen-ion diffusion and oxygen surface exchange coefficients. Considering the anion-intercalated charge storage 
mechanism of perovskite oxides is mainly determined by oxygen vacancy and oxygen ion diffusion, the influence of Zr substitution on 
structure, oxygen vacancy and electrochemical performance of SrFeO3-δ 
in supercapacitor applications is worth further investigating. As is 
known to all, this significant research issue has not been responded yet. 
Therefore, the prime purpose of this work is to deeply seek how Zr 
substitution affects the structure and physico-chemical property of 
SrFeO3-δ material. Meanwhile, a novel perovskite-type oxide has been 
provided as negative material for supercapacitor applications. Last but 
not least, the present study provides a facile method for supercapacitor 
negative electrode preparation compared to conventional methods. 
Herein, Zr-substituted SrFeO3-δ (SrFe1-xZrxO3-δ) have been synthesized for the first time by a simple solid-state sintering method in a onepat approach. As-prepared SrFe1-xZrxO3-δ materials were utilized as 
negative active materials of supercapacitor. The effects of Zr substitution 
on the surface morphology, phase composition, crystal structure, oxygen 
vacancy and electrochemical properties have been deeply studied. This 
work enriches the research of perovskite-type oxides applied as supercapacitor electrodes, especially negative ones."
334_Intro.txt,"Supercapacitors (SCs), as excellent energy storage equipment,
are favored by the practical market due to high power density,
good safety, environmental friendliness and outstanding cyclic stability [1–3], which can be utilized in smart power grid, urban rail
transit, aerospace and other fields. Nevertheless, the relatively
low energy density of SCs compared with the other energy storage
candidates still hinders their further application [4,5]. In general,
transition metal oxides with variable valence states (e.g., titanium
dioxide [6], vanadium pentoxide [7], ferric oxide [8,9], cobalt oxide
[10,11], nickel oxide [12], ruthenium dioxide [13] and MnO2
[14,15]) are considered as ideal electrode materials due to their
high theoretical capacitances, which is derived from the pseudocapacitance through reversible redox reactions. Among them,
MnO2-based SCs have attracted much attention due to their abundant reserves, low cost, wide operation potential window. Especially, the MnO2 can be utilized in neutral environment, which
can increase the utilization safety and convenience [16,17]. Among
the various crystallographic structures of MnO2, d-MnO2 with open
two-dimensional layered structure and interlayer tunnels is
believed can effectively enhance the mass transfer efficiency inside
the bulk materials [18–20]. However, the MnO2-based electrodes
still suffer from the inadequate active sites, poor electrical conductivity (105 to 106 S cm1
) and inferior charge transfer ability,
resulting in relatively low actual specific capacitance and energy
density [21,22]. Therefore, the effective increasement of the actual
specific capacitance for the MnO2-based materials is of great significance in the application.
Generally, the extension of the potential window and the
increasement of specific capacitance are two main strategies to
increase the energy density. The intercalation of cations (e.g., K+
and Na+
) is believed can effectively capture transfer electrons
and reduce the oxygen evolution active site density, thus possessing a wide operation potential window and excellent cycling stability [23–27]. Moreover, the intercalation of K+ can reduce the
valence state of the Mn species and induce extra redox coupling,
thus further enhancing the pseudo-capacitance energy storage
ability [18,28]. Furthermore, defect engineering strategy is
regarded as an effective way to regulate the electronic configuration on the MnO2 surface, which can not only effectively expose
the active sites, but also promote the surface redox reaction kinetics to increase the intrinsic capacitance [29–32]. Qiu et al. reported
a MnO2 nanorods with native oxygen vacancies introduced by H2
calcination, which revealed enhanced electrical conductivity and
plenty of active sites [33]. Cui et al. fabricated oxygen vacancies
on MnO2 surface by the mixed H-/O-plasma to significantly
improve the electrochemical performance [34]. However, these
methods usually require complicated fabrication processes or
harsh handling environments, hindering large-scale fabrication
and process safety. In addition, the crystalline defects tend to
self-healing due to thermodynamic instability, which results in a
decreased electrochemical stability [34]. Therefore, a safe and efficient method to fabricate electrode materials with stable oxygen
defects becomes a key issue to improve electrochemical property.
Herein, in order to solve these problems, wet chemical reduction process is introduced as a defect fabrication strategy [35],
while the ligands are used to refill and stabilize these defects.
The K+ doped d-MnO2 nanosheet arrays anchored on CC (MnO2/
CC) are firstly prepared by simply hydrothermal process. After that,
oxygen vacancies are produced by reductive ethanol/Mn2+ on/inside the MnO2 nanosheets and occupied by 2-MI ligands to form
the MI-MnO2-x/CC. The introduction of 2-MI can increase the stability of the oxygen defects and interlayer channels, as well as
modulate the electronic structure and improve electrical
conductivity [36,37]. Moreover, the reductive treatment can also
introduce multivalent Mn species inside the nanosheets, which
reveals high redox capability and increases the intrinsic capacitance [38]. Therefore, the MI-MnO2-x/CC reveals an enlarged operation potential window of 1.3 V, a high-reversible capacitance of
721.2 mF cm2 at 1 mA cm2 and capacitance retention of 93.4%
after 10,000 cycles. Moreover, an asymmetric supercapacitor
(ASC) composed of MI-MnO2-x/CC and activated mechanical exfoliated graphene oxide (a-MEGO) with 1.0 M sodium sulfate (Na2SO4)
as electrolyte can exhibit a maximum energy density of 57.0 Wh
kg1
, a highest power density of 23.0 kW kg1
, and excellent
capacitance retention of 96.0% after 10,000 cycles under a potential
window of 2.3 V."
335_Intro.txt,"Nowadays, the whole world is struggling with environmental problems related to the pollution caused by the use of fossil fuels. These 
problems do not end with pollution, as it is known that the depletion of 
these sources could soon lead to an energy crisis. As a consequence, a 
majority of countries have currently been focusing on the use of 
renewable energy sources, which can be a solution to this emerging 
problem. However, it is important to be aware of the limitation of their 
periodic availability, which is especially noticeable in the case of solar or 
wind energy. The answer to this problem may be the application of 
effective and efficient technologies that will enable the storage of energy 
in order to use it at the most convenient time. Supercapacitors, also 
known as electrochemical capacitors, are one of energy storage systems 
that exhibit higher energy density than conventional capacitors and 
higher power density than batteries[1,2]. 
What is more, in energy storage devices such as batteries or supercapacitors, binders are quite often an inherent element, which does not 
support the energy storage process, but plays role in improving physical 
contacts. However, their use also contributes to the deterioration of 
some parameters of the device, causing the reduction of volumetric and 
gravimetric capacitance. Its presence also may contribute to the occurrence of side reactions during the charging and discharging processes, 
usually leading to additional costs, and in the case of the binders such as 
polyvinylidene fluoride, an additional increase in the resistance value 
may be observed[3,4]. Therefore, the synthesis of the electrode material 
directly on the current collector is an eminently desirable process in 
obtaining the superior overall performance of the energy storage device.Transition metal dichalcogenides, in particular, are gaining more 
and more attention in terms of their use as energy storage electrode 
materials, precisely because of their layered structure and the weak van 
der Waals bonds between the individual layers [5,6], which enable fast 
charging and discharging, while maintaining stability comparable to 
that offered by two-dimensional carbon materials [7–9]. MoS2 structure 
consists of three planes in the order of S-Mo-S, with molybdenum 
sandwiched between two sulfur layers[10] (see Fig. 2a,b). Depending 
on which phase of MoS2 is investigated, it is characterized by distinctive 
features. When it comes to energy storage applications, the most 
attention is paid to the 1T trigonal and the 2H hexagonal MoS2 structure. 
Octahedral 1T phase is a metallic one, which is mainly obtained through 
the transition from the 2H phase by an electron beam application, laser 
irradiation, or ion intercalation process [11–13]. Obtaining a 1T phase is 
particularly desirable and the research is directed toward this one 
mainly due to its high conductivity, although its stability is still a 
challenge to face. On the contrary, the 2H phase, which is a trigonal 
prismatic structure, possesses semiconductive properties and exceeds 
other polymorphs in terms of stability. Sakar et al. reported molybdenum sulfide electrode material, containing both 1T and 2H phases, that 
exhibited a volumetric capacitance of 212 F cm− 3 and even 343 F cm− 3 
when it was combined with reduced graphene oxide [14]. Furthermore, 
a thin film of MoS2 obtained by Pujari et al. using low temperature soft 
chemical synthesis approach was characterized by the volumetric 
capacitance of 911 F cm− 3 [15]. MoS2 synthesis through DC sputtering 
was also shown to be an effective way to obtain thin, nanostructured 
films of specific capacitance of 138 F g− 1 and the cycling ability of 86% 
after 5 000 cycles [16]. In another report by Acerce et al.[17], metallic 
1T MoS2 phase exhibited the volumetric capacitance ranging from 400 
to 700 F cm− 3
, depending on the aqueous electrolyte that had been used. 
When characterizing electrode materials for energy storage, a 
commonly used counter electrode is platinum, also for materials with 
other applications, such as electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction 
(HER), photoelectrochemical water splitting and amperometric sensors. 
It is well known that, due to its excellent electrochemical inertness, 
electrical conductivity and mechanical stability, platinum is considered 
to be one of the most appropriate materials for use as a counter electrode 
in electrochemical measurements. However, Cervino et al. were the first 
to describe that platinum may undergo dissolution at high anodic potentials in an acidic environment [18]. The influence of polarization on 
the dissolution was also observed by some other authors, as well 
[19–21]. Apart from that, there are other several factors that may affect 
the rate of Pt dissolution like temperature, scan rate, and potential range 
[22–26]. Moreover, some recent reports on the use of a Pt electrode in 
HER measurements also indicate that the Pt electrode may undergo an 
electrochemical dissolution-deposition process and thus greatly affect 
the experimental results [19,27–29]. As a matter of fact, the phenomenon of platinum dissolution has already been widely studied in relation 
to fuel cells application, and recently the issue has also been raised by 
Wei et al. questioning its use as a counter electrode in HER measurements [30], but it was also pointed by Jerkiewicz [31] that a great deal 
of the knowledge regarding platinum electrochemistry is undocumented. Furthermore, many reports not only on MoS2, but also other 
transition-metal dichalcogenides, as well as carbon materials indicate 
that the dissolution-deposition phenomenon of Pt but also the doping 
itself can be used to improve the properties of an electrode material [20, 
21,32–36]. However, most reports on this topic primarily deal with 
hydrogen evolution reactions and thus, we believe that this is the first 
time when the phenomena is observed in the electrochemical measurements performed for electrode materials with application for energy 
storage in supercapacitors. 
Furthermore, there are no reports about a change in the chemical 
composition of the material upon Pt doping and/or repetitive cycling. In 
the literature, MoS2 conversion to MoO3 was reported by Ko et al.[37]. 
using plasma oxidation. The transformation was also obtained by 
ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy combined with heat 
treatment [38]. Recently Hou et al. investigated the phase transition of 
MoS2 during sodiation in charge/discharge cycles, indicating that one of 
the intermediate products is metallic Mo, some of which oxidizes during 
the charging process, resulting in MoO3 and oxygen-deficient MoOx 
[39]. The presence of molybdenum oxides in electrode materials for 
energy storage has been extensively considered due to their promising 
specific capacitance, multiple oxidation states, and environmental 
friendliness. Especially when it comes to molybdenum oxides with 
intrinsic oxygen vacancies, they are highly attractive as they are characterized by greatly increased conductivity [40,41] but which was also 
presented by Dunn et al., oxygen vacancies facilitate faster charge 
storage kinetics, leading to improved capacitance and cycle life [40]. 
Furthermore, it is often recognized that molybdenum-based oxides have 
limited cycle life and poor performance hinders the application for 
long-term energy storage applications. To increase capacitance retention, several approaches are being introduced. As an example, Cai et al. 
stated that by introducing K+ into the MoOx structure, it was possible to 
shift from Mo5+/Mo6+ to Mo4+/Mo5+ charge storage redox couple. As a 
consequence, both the conductivity and the overall electrochemical 
performance were enhanced, altogether with the prolonged cycle life of 
the supercapacitor [42]. 
In most of the cases observed with MoS2-based materials for energy 
storage applications, the material degrades after repeated charging and 
discharging cycles, resulting in a decreasing capacitance. The phenomenon of capacitance increase was observed in several literature reports, 
however, it was temporary and only observed in the initial charge and 
discharge cycles [43], as generally for MoS2-based electrode materials it 
is typical to observe a gradual degradation of specific capacitance with 
subsequent cycles, which is a major limitation in long-term energy 
storage applications. The exception is the work presented by Bissett 
et al., who reported a significant increase in capacitance during the first 
3 000 cycles for MoS2/graphene composite, which was attributed to the 
progressive exfoliation of the material, associated with ion intercalation/deintercalation [44]. Furthermore, little work has so far 
analyzed what happens to the material during charge/discharge cycles. 
Several reports only indicate phase transition occurring during the 
intercalation and deintercalation of lithium or sodium ions in the materials used in battery applications, including MoS2-based materials 
[45–48]. Nonetheless, no detailed investigation of the changes taking 
place in the material during charge/discharge cycles was performed 
together with the analysis of the charge storage mechanism, with the 
simultaneous observation of the phenomenon of a significant increase in 
specific capacitance. 
Therefore, in this work, several approaches to the synthesis of 
molybdenum-based electrode materials for supercapacitors are shown, 
including anodization, hydrothermal process, and annealing. Furthermore, we present a complex analysis of the Pt-surface modification 
during multiple charging and discharging cycles of the electrode material prepared via anodization of a molybdenum plate, followed by a 
hydrothermal process in thiourea aqueous solution with the energy 
storage mechanism study. The influence of platinum-surface modification and using platinum as a counter electrode on charge storage performance and charge storage mechanism in studied electrode material is 
investigated as well. It was shown that the prolonged process of modification of the electrode surface with platinum enhanced the phenomenon of the capacitance increase. After 60 000 cycles, the specific 
capacitance of the electrode material modified with Pt particles 
increased to over 1 F cm− 2
, whereas the symmetric two-electrode system 
reached a capacitance of 140 mF cm− 2 and in each case, the coulombic 
efficiency was above 97% during all the cycles. Furthermore, this study 
reveals the changes taking place in the composition of the molybdenum 
disulfide thin layer, presenting the transition to mixed molybdenum 
oxides. Together with the transition from sulfides to oxides and introduction of oxygen vacancies, the contribution of the pseudocapacitive 
energy storage mechanism is enhanced. It is also emphasized that when 
Pt counter electrode is used in the study of energy storage materials,careful consideration should be given to the investigation due to the 
dissolution-deposition phenomenon of platinum. "
336_Intro.txt,"In terms with the realistic demand of ‘carbon peak and carbon
neutralization’, it is very important to build a clean, low-carbon,
safe, and efficient energy system. To date, renewable energy, such
as solar energy [1], hydropower [2], and wind energy [3], is the
most promising solution. However, the electricity generated by
intermittent renewable energy conversion needs to be stored by
energy storage technologies [4e6]. Among various energy storage
devices, batteries [7e9] and supercapacitors [10e12] play a major
role in the field of energy storage technologies. And the selection of
electrode materials also becomes a high priority for energy storage
devices. Ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials are
emerging as a very promising new material since the discovery of
graphene in 2004 [13]. Benefited from exceptional chemical and
physical properties, 2D molybdenum compounds have been
indispensably enriching the development of 2D ultrathin families
[14]. Particularly, molybdenum oxides have great potential in
electrochemical energy storage due to their unique structural and
electronic characteristics.
To date, molybdenum oxides were found with different compositions, including MoO3, MoO2, and some intermediates, have
been delicately synthesized and explored in a variety of energy
storage applications. Three-dimensional structure of these molybdenum oxides originates from the unit of MoO6 octahedra stacked
by edge-sharing and/or corner-sharing styles. MoO6 octahedra
afford different equilibrium bond distances due to their special
coordination modes, which significantly affects the lengths of
MoeO bond. Herein, an octahedra feature is rooted from the
connection of six O to one Mo atoms, and the O atom is enclosed by
three Mo atoms at the corner of an equilateral triangle. Additionally, the empty sites between the MoO6 octahedra in molybdenum
oxides are used as hosting those foreign ions like Hþ and Liþ, which
are perfectly favorable for the de-/insertion processes in electrode
materials. Concurrently, it occurs with the migration of small ions,
accompanied by a partial reduction of Mo oxidation states.
Although a variety of reviews has been published for addressing
the research progress of 2D materials, almost all of them have
attracted great attention in the search for synthesis and applications of molybdenum oxides. Unfortunately, due to the properties of molybdenum oxide, little attention has been paid to
its charge-storage characteristics in different charge carriers, such
as metal charge carriers (Liþ, Zn2þ) and non-metallic charge carriers (Hþ), and potential charge-storage mechanisms. Moreover, the
number of publications of molybdenum oxide in the field of energy
charge storage has also increased rapidly, as shown in Fig. 1. Thus, it
is very necessary and timely now for offering a comprehensive
review, which addresses the comprehensive understanding specific
properties and charge-storage mechanisms of molybdenum oxides
in the style of electrochemical energy storage.
In this review, we aim to summarize physical, electronic, and
chemical properties of nanostructured molybdenum oxides. The
effect of crystal field theory and their electronic band structure
design on the resulting performance correlated to electrochemical
energy storage are fully discussed. Then, the synthesis techniques
and characterization of MoO3-x, such as synthetic advantages and
the critical challenges, are explored. Benefited from such merits, an
in-depth discussion regarding the charge-storage mechanisms of
molybdenum oxides integrated with their electrochemical applications including Li-ion batteries, non-Li-ion batteries, and
supercapacitors are described with remarks on their derived performance (Fig. 2). As spreading the whole spectrum, besides the
achieved progresses, the opportunities and perspectives of future
efforts are proposed for this promising field."
338_Intro.txt,"In the recent years, the environmental pollution has steadily 
increased due to the high consumption of fossil fuels, therefore, the 
clean production of energy and its storage have become an urgent priority worldwide [1,2]. For this last purpose, the researchers have 
developed supercapacitors (SCs), which are effective and practical for 
the energy conversion and storage. They have high-power densities (>
10 Wh Kg− 1
), possess high cyclic stability (above 90% of capacitance 
retention after 5000–10,000 cycles of charge/discharge) and controllable output voltage [1–3]. Currently, the state of the art SCs are flexible, 
thin, light and/or transparent [4–7]. In order to improve the performance of the SCs, their electrodes have been composed of pure a carbon 
plus metal oxides such as RuO2, MnO2, In2O3, CuO, or Co2O3 and/or 
conducting polymers such as polypyrrole and poly(3, 
4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) [8]. 
The combination of the carbon network with these redox materials 
significantly increases the capacitance of flexible electrodes at least 10 
times [9,10]. On the other hand, Zinc oxide (ZnO) is widely used for 
applications in catalysis [11], gas sensing [12], solar cells [13] and 
transparent conductors [14]. It is an inexpensive oxide, whose 
morphology (nanorods, micro-flowers, microspheres and nanomultipods) can be easily controlled and presents high chemical and 
physical stability. Moreover, the literature indicates that the ZnO contains defects such as oxygen vacancies (Vo) and zinc interstitials that 
improve the ferromagnetic and optical properties [15]. In fact, those 
defects could serve as redox centers for the charge storage. For this 
reason, Alfawaz et al. [16] reported ZnO nanoparticles with sizes of 
100–500 nm and spherical/cylindrical morphology, which were compacted to produce SC electrodes and had a maximum capacitance of 
209.8 F g− 1 as well as energy densities of 3.7–4.7 Wh kg− 1
. Another 
work by Kim et al. [17] reported that electrodes made of zinc oxide/activated carbon nanofiber exhibited a maximum capacitance of 
178.2 F g− 1 and energy density of 22.7 Wh kg− 1
, while maintaining a 
moderate capacitance retention of 75% after 1000 cycles of charge/discharge. Other works reported the fabrication of solid-state supercapacitors based on composites of ZnO QDs/carbon/CNTs and 
ZnO/graphene, which produced capacitances in the range of 156–185 F 
g− 1 as well as energy densities in the range of 21–24 Wh kg− 1 [18,19]. 
Very recently, ZnO based electrodes such as ZnO@PdO/Pd (synthesized 
by a hydrothermal method) [20], Ni doped ZnO (synthesized by a 
co-precipitation method) [21] and ZnO/reduced-graphene-oxide [22] 
produced capacitances of 170–295 F g− 1
. Although the ZnO based solid 
state supercapacitors/electrodes have been developed, they still present 
the following disadvantages in general: 1) they have low capacitances 
(<300 F g− 1
) and low energy densities (<30 Wh kg− 1
) even though the 
electrodes have a high surface area (>400 m2 g− 1
), 2) they are not 
flexible and 3) most of them include other high-cost components such as 
carbon quantum dots, palladium, carbon nanotubes or noble metals. To 
overcome those advantages, the ZnO has been combined with other 
compounds such as Co3O4 and this enhanced the capacitance up to 740 
F g− 1 and 36.6 Wh kg− 1 [23]. However, this last strategy is not enough 
because the energy density is still low. 
By considering the scarcity of works about ZnO based solid state 
supercapacitors and the need to enhance their energy density, this work 
developed solid state symmetric SCs using as electrodes graphene 
composites coated by a layer of ZnO (which was synthesized using 
different dopants such as Al, In and Ga) and evaluated their electrochemical performance (capacitance and energy density). Basically, this 
research studied how the use of different types of ZnO (ZnO:Al, ZnO:In 
and ZnO:Ga) affected the performance of the SCs to store charge. Utilizing such doped ZnO in SCs has not been reported previously to the 
best of our knowledge. According to the results of this research, the 
introduction of dopants in the ZnO created oxygen vacancy defects in its 
crystalline lattice, these in turn, benefited the electrochemical performance of the supercapacitors because the capacitance and energy density produced by the SC devices containing doped ZnO was enhanced up 
to 193% with respect to a reference device made without ZnO. Moreover, the presence of the doped ZnO into the SCs electrodes prolonged 
even more their discharge times (by ≈ 250 s). Thus, the results of this 
research demonstrated that incorporating different doped ZnO (ZnO:Al, 
ZnO:In and ZnO:Ga) is a feasible strategy to increase the capacitance and 
energy density of the solid state SCs and the utilization of ZnO is suitable 
because it is an inexpensive and abundant material. "
339_Intro.txt,"With the sustainable growth of population and the rapid development of economy, traditional fossil energy not only cannot meet people’s needs but also bring serious environmental pollution. Therefore, a 
large number of sustainable, renewable, green and low-carbon new 
energy is constantly emerging, and how to efficiently store energy has 
become the key to research [1–3]. A great deal of effort has been put into 
new and efficient energy storage units. Because of their excellent characteristics such as rapid charge and discharge, outstanding power density, splendid circulation stability and other on, supercapacitors are 
widely used in various fields [4–7]. Depending on the storage mechanism, supercapacitors can be divided into three categories [8]. The first 
type is pseudocapacitance, which is underpotential deposition and 
reversible chemisorption or redox reaction of electroactive substances 
on the electrode surface to generate capacitance related to the electrode 
charging potential [9]. Then, electrical double-layer capacitors (EDLC) 
is a kind of electrostatic energy storage which relies on ion adsorption/desorption on electrode surface without redox reaction in the 
process [10]. Finally, the positive and negative materials of the hybrid 
capacitors are chosen pseudocapacitance characteristic materials with 
high specific capacitors and EDLC properties with good cyclic, respectively. They complement each other to further meet the multifaceted 
demands of energy devices. 
In recent years, related researches on metal-organic frameworks 
(MOFs) have become increasingly abundant, where both prussian blue 
(PB) and PBA also belong to important and simple MOFs. PB has a cubic 
crystal structure and is octahedral coordination, composing of a cyanide 
ligand (-C–
–
–N-) with a carbon end connected to the Fe2+, the nitrogenous end is connected with Fe3+ (Fe2+-CN-Fe3+) [11]. It is found that the 
internal structure of PB is adjustable because of its open frame structure 
and special mixed valence states. The Fe element can be replaced by 
other metal elements (such as Ni, Mn, Co and so on.) without damaging 
the crystal structure, resulting in a series of new compounds collectively 
known as PBA [12]. PB and PBA also have similar advantages to MOF, 
such as diverse structure, high porosity, controllable pore size, etc. 
Meanwhile, their mixed valence state composition can provide multiple 
active sites for the redox reaction [13]. These advantages are that PBA 
has broad prospects in the field of electrochemical energy storage [14]. 
However, most studies have found that the electrochemical properties of 
simple PB and PBA are not very excellent and cannot satisfy the actual 
application requirements. Therefore, with PBA as the precursor, the 
porous hollow structure electrode material similar to PBA was obtained 
as well as the complex was formed by various methods, which have 
more open diffusion channels and more active sites, thereby improving 
the electrochemical performance [15]. For example, Wu and his colleagues reported that core-shell shaped Ni2CoHCF@PPy microspheres 
from PBA with the capacitance of 82 mA hg− 1 and 86% capacitance retention after 3000 charge/discharge cycles, showing good cyclic stability [16]. Ren Rt al. prepared the hollow CoS2 nanocubes through a 
two-step process. The CoS2 nanocube have a very high specific surface 
area (113.9 m2 g− 1
), and the retention rate is 83% after 5000 cycles 
[17]. And Sun and his companions designed that a 3D ZnCo-PBA@α-Co 
(OH)2 composites, the porous nanospheres were loaded with Co(OH)2 
nanosheets, which showed good electrochemical performance [18]. 
Layered double hydroxide (LDH) is a typical two-dimensional 
layered material, which has attracted extensive attention due to their 
layered structure, large surface volume, excellent anion exchange performance, low cost and environmental friendliness [19–22]. LDH is 
composed of two or more metal elements and the structural formula is 
generally [M2+
(1− x)M3+
(x)(OH)2]
x+[An− ]x/n⋅mH2O, where M stands for 
metallic element and An− is the charge-balancing anion [23]. During the 
charging and discharging process, 2D nanosheets are beneficial to guide 
ion/electron transport to the interlayer spacing, improve the utilization 
of electroactive sites and increasing the ion transfer rate [24]. However, 
the electrochemical properties of LDH is not very ideal due to its aggregation, low conductivity and short cycle life [25,26]. Therefore, it is 
found that the porous PBA structure can be combined with LDH to 
obtain composite materials with excellent electrochemical performance. 
Inspired by relevant literature, we use a simple route to design 
CeO2@NiFe-LDH cubic composites with porous nanostructures. NiFeLDH nanosheets with a larger specific surface area were loaded on 3D 
porous Fe–CeO2 by hydrothermal method, in which Fe–CeO2 is formed 
by CeFe-PBA calcination in air. The formation of NiFe-LDH layer not 
only improves the surface structure of Fe–CeO2, but also elevates the 
electrochemical performance. Because of the synergistic effect between 
Fe–CeO2 and NiFe-LDH, electron and ion transfer are promoted. Various 
electrochemical tests were executed on the CeO2@NiFe-LDH composite 
electrode in KOH electrolyte, which showed the specific capacitance of 
516.524 F g− 1 and good cycling performance (83.442%). In particular, 
the ASC of CeO2@NiFe-LDH//AC has an energy density of 21.167 Wh 
kg− 1 at 750 W kg− 1
. Therefore, CeO2@NiFe-LDH composites with 
porous nanostructures have excellent electrochemical properties and 
potential practical application prospects.

future.8−10 Based on the equation of E = 1/2CV2

density of SCs can be elevated by broadening the voltage

Numerous research studies have focused on developing
asymmetric SCs (ASCs) that can utilize different operating

the potential window of the cell system.14−17 Most of the ASCs
are composed of two reactions: one for electric double-layer
reaction which possesses a carbon-based material as the negative
electrode material and another for pseudocapacitance reaction
with metal oxides as the positive electrode material.15,16,18 The
transition-metal oxide as a material of pseudocapacitance is the
main strategy for efficient SCs because of the limitated specific
capacitance of activated carbon (AC) (usually less than 300 F
g−1
).19−21 Mesoporous α-MnO2, with a high theoretical capacity
(∼1370 F g−1
), is considered as a potential alternative to the
electrode material of commercial RuO2 because of its prominent
2 × 2 open tunnel structure (about 0.46 nm).22−26 However, the
poor electrical conductivity and relatively sluggish ion-transfer
performance of α-MnO2 hinder the high energy density and
large-scale applications seriously because the internal electronic
configuration of α-MnO2 limited external conductive reinforcement.4
Recently, defect engineering is a good method for the
electronic configuration regulation for tuning the surface
chemistry configuration on metal oxides.27−29 On the basis of
previous studies,4,10,30 adjusting the valence states of α-MnO2
could turn the binding mode between Mnx+ ions and oxygen in
the crystal, resulting in significant changes in its ionic and
electronic states, thus promoting the formation of defects, such
as oxygen vacancies.31,32 Oxygen vacancies can not only achieve
ideal electron configuration and effectively improve electrical
conductivity but also form a local electric field around it, which
makes the transfer of interface electrons/ions in the electrolyte
easier.33−38 However, the existence of oxygen vacancies will
affect the valence states of manganese ions because Mn(IV) will change into the lower-valent Mn(II/III) on α-MnO2 with rich
oxygen vacancy.25 Therefore, it is a contradiction between the
rich oxygen vacancy and the high ratio of Mn(IV), which is a big
challenge in the development of electrochemical storage of αMnO2 that has remained rarely explored.
Herein, we demonstrate effective construction of oxygen
vacancies on mixed-valent mesoporous α-MnO2 through simply
controlling the degree of redox reaction process, which could
control the ion-transfer dynamics for ASCs. The content/ratio
of different valence states of Mn and the concentration of oxygen
vacancy in α-MnO2 can be changed by changing the amount of
Na2SO3 reagent. α-MnO2-0.25 as an electrode material with an
appropriate Mn3+/Mn4+ ratio and abundant oxygen vacancy
showed an outstanding SC of 324 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 in neutral
Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. Moreover, α-MnO2-0.25 as a
positive electrode in assembled ASCs and AC as a negative
electrode showed large specific energy in an aqueous device
(36.33 W h kg−1 at 200 W kg−1
) and good cycle stability
(maintained at approximately 98% after 10 000 cycles). Based
on these results, adjusting valence states and oxygen vacancies of
manganese oxides simultaneously to make them well balanced is
an effective strategy to synthesize MnO2 materials with excellent
performance, which provides a potential industrial application

341_Intro.txt,"Battery-supercapacitor hybrid (BSH) device, as a promising portable 
energy storage product, has extensively studied fort its combined character of battery-type high energy capacity and capacitor-type high 
power density [1–3]. However, the performance of a BSH device is 
extremely restricted to its electrode, especially for the battery-type 
anode which needs to deliver high charge-storage capacity [4]. Therefore, designing and fabricating anode materials of high-performance is 
vital to wide application of BSH devices. 
Binary transition metal oxides, such as Co3O4, MnO2, and Fe3O4, etc., 
have become a research hotspot in the field of energy storage material in 
recent years [5–7]. However, poor conductivity and unpleasant cycle 
stability are becoming a bottleneck for most binary metal oxides to 
further improve their electrochemical performances [8]. Recently, 
ternary transition metal oxides have attracted more and more attention 
because they can combine two different metal cations in one compound 
to enhance electrical conductivity with synergism and provide metal 
cations of different oxidation state [9,10]. 
As an important ternary transition metal oxide, cobalt tungstate 
(CoWO4) with wolframite-type structure had been extensively reported 
in electrochemical energy storage applications for its multiple valence 
states and earth-abundance [11]. For example, He et al. [9] reported a 
shuttle-like CoWO4 supercapacitors electrode on Ni foam through a 
conventional hydrothermal process, which displayed a specific capacitance of 764.4 F g− 1 at 1 A g− 1 and excellent cycling stability. Heytor 
et al. [12] used a proteic sol-gel method to obtain CoWO4 powders as 
magnetic and battery-like electrodes, which showed excellent paramagnetic behavior as well as typical faradaic redox reaction properties. 
Xing et al. [13] synthesized amorphous and crystalline CoWO4 nanoparticles by wet-chemical method and hydrothermal method, which 
showed a specific capacitance of 370.0 F g− 1 and 212.0 F g− 1 at 1 A g− 1
, 
respectively. Despite these efforts, it is hard to exert the potentiality of 
CoWO4 in electrochemical application because of the difficulty in 
morphology regulating and its self-aggregation nature as well as W 
cation in this ternary transition metal oxide does not participate in the 
energy storage process [14]. 
Recently, with the help of urea and NH4F, we synthesized a structured carambola-like CoWO4 microsphere by a microwave assisted hydrothermal process together with post annealing treatment in air, which 
showed significant improvement on charge storage capacity. Apparently, high specific surface and dispersion of this porous carambola-like 
microsphere is an important tributary of capacity improvement. It was 
noticed that the CoWO4 microspheres show a preferred crystal plane 
different from the one in the standard card, which can also be observed 
from the reported XRD patterns of CoWO4 prepared by the wet-chemical 
method and microwave-assisted hydrothermal process [13,15]. More 
importantly, these CoWO4 with new preferred crystal plane also showed 
an enlarged capacity. It is well known that crystal plane engineering and 
defect engineering are feasible approaches to tune the electrochemical 
properties of nanomaterials [16,17]. In general, in the process of crystal 
growth, the internal grains grow around some of specific orientations, 
resulting in preferred orientation growth [18,19]. The preferred exposed 
growth facets of a nanomaterial can be produced by selectively controlling the nucleation and growth rates in different directions during 
crystal growth. The variation of the exposed surface atomic arrangements on different crystal facets can lead to differences in the surface 
electronic structures, which may trigger changes in the intrinsic properties of nanomaterials [16,20]. Zhao et al. [17] reported an effective 
reflux strategy for manipulating the exposed {112} crystal facets of 
Co3O4 hexagonal nanosheets evoluted from ZIF-67 with enhanced catalytic activity and water resistance for CO and hydrocarbons oxidation. 
Zhou et al. [21] reported a stable and reversible Zn anode with (002) 
surface-preferred crystal plane through crystal orientation growth. It 
was found that more free dendrites, no by-products and weak hydrogen 
evolution can be achieved by tuning the surface-preferred crystal plane. 
Zhang et al. [22] synthesized the heterostructured WO3@CoWO4 bilayer 
nanosheets with abundant interfacial oxygen vacancies, which effectively reduce the energy barriers in the OER as highly efficient catalyst. 
Meanwhile, in literatures [13,15], the reported XRD patterns of CoWO4 
prepared by the wet-chemical method and the microwave-assisted hydrothermal process showed the diffraction intensities of new preferred 
crystal plane, which wasn’t specifically mentioned by the authors. 
However, these CoWO4 with new preferred crystal plane showed an 
enlarged capacity. Therefore, it is worthwhile to study the effect of 
preferred crystal plane and oxygen vacancy on electrochemical properties of CoWO4. 
Herein, the carambola-like CoWO4 microsphere precursor was first 
synthesized by a microwave-assisted hydrothermal process. The precursor was then individually annealed in air and nitrogen (named as ACoWO4 and N–CoWO4, respectively) to obtain two kinds of CoWO4, 
which have the identical microsphere morphology, but different 
preferred crystal plane and oxygen vacancy content. By this way, the 
effect of preferred crystal plane and oxygen vacancy on boosting electrochemical performances of CoWO4 were thoroughly characterized and 
assessed by electrochemical tests, kinetic studies combined with the 
density functional theory (DFT) analysis. Additionally, the long-term 
cycling test revealed that A-CoWO4 continuously remolded its 
morphology, eventually into a flower-like microsphere with the surface 
being constructed by intersected nanosheets, which may lead to its unconventional increase in capacity during cycling. Finally, an A-CoWO4// 
6 M KOH//activated carbon (AC) BSH device was assembled, which 
presented a satisfactory energy density of 27.5 Wh kg− 1 at 1031.4 W

342_Intro.txt,"Recent development in the portable electronic appliances and 
hybrid electric automobiles led to a considerable attention to search 
for high performing, eco-friendly energy storage devices such as 
supercapacitors [1,2]. Supercapacitors are a crossing bridge devices 
between conventional capacitors and rechargeable batteries owing 
to their high specific power (> 500 W kg–1), long-term cyclic stability 
(> 105 cycles) and stability in comparison to batteries [3,4]. Electrical 
double layer capacitors (EDLCs; non-Faradaic) and pseudocapacitors 
(Faradaic) are the two prime charge storage mechanisms of supercapacitors. Carbon based materials are extensively used in EDLCs, 
which represent charge accumulation at the interface between the 
electrode and electrolyte. In contrast, in pseudocapacitors, Faradaic 
redox reactions happen at the electrode surface [5]. Combining fast 
and the reversible Faradaic process along with non-Faradaic electric 
double layer formation increases the storage capacity of the pseudocapacitors, as charging is not limited by bulk ion diffusion as in 
batteries [6]. 
Transition metal oxides (TMO) or hydroxides and conductive 
polymers are the widely dominated pseudocapacitive electrode 
materials. However, the poor electrical conductivities and slow 
Faradaic reaction kinetics hinder their performance at high current 
densities [7]. Research in the field of negative electrodes for supercapacitor application is primarily focused on carbon allotropes such 
as reduced graphene oxide, carbon onions, and graphene oxide etc. Therefore, designing a non-carbon type supercapacitor negative 
electrode is of vital importance now-a-days. 
Molybdenum oxide (MoO3) is considered as a suitable TMO for 
vast applications such as gas sensing [8,9], catalyst [10], and energy 
storage devices e.g., pseudocapacitors [1]. MoO3 has a tuneable 
chemical structure which determines its electronic [11] and optical 
properties [12]. It exists in different phases; the most common ones 
are the thermodynamically stable orthorhombic α-phase (space 
group pbmn), the metastable monoclinic β-phase (space group 
p21/m), and the metastable hexagonal h-phase (space group pb3/m) 
[13]. Among these, only α-MoO3 as a broad band gap (≈3.2 eV) n-type 
material has a desired layer structure, which facilitates the synthesis 
of different 2D and 1D nanostructures offering large surface area. The 
high surface area improves intercalation process ability in electrochemical devices [14,15]. The α-MoO3 crystal consists of bi-layers, 
which are formed from linked distorted MoO6 octahedral with a 
corner-share along a-axis and edge-sharing cross zigzag along c-axis. 
The lamellar formation occurs, when double bi-layers connect 
through Van der Waals bonds through b-axis. Notably, α-MoO3 has 
various coordination numbers ranging from 0 to 8 and oxidation 
states (2 + to 6 +) that determine its conductivity [15,16]. 
α-MoO3 has a higher theoretical specific capacity (1111 mAh 
g−1) than graphite (gravimetric capacity of 372 mAh g−1) [17]. The 
main limitation in achieving this theoretical specific capacitance 
using 
α-MoO3, is its low electrical conductivity. In addition, conventional 
α-MoO3 nanostructures lead to a drop in device performance over 
time during charge-discharge cycles [18]. Different strategies can 
be employed to overcome the inferior device performance and 
instability. For instance, conductivity of MoO3 can be tuned by 
controlling oxygen deficiency in the crystal, which in turn, also 
controls its stoichiometry. The stoichiometric α-MoO3 structure 
is considered as an insulator, whereas the sub-stoichiometric 
structure is a semiconductor material, leading to enhanced electrochemical activity [1]. Moreover, morphological engineering 
such as interconnected arrays of metal oxides nanostructures 
grown on conductive substrates can also enhance charge/ion 
transport and electrochemical activity (thus a higher electrochemical performance) [4]. Furthermore, hybridization of α-MoO3 
with carbon material (the so-called carbonization) can enhance 
electrochemical performance by improving thermal and electrical 
conductivities and also can improve electrochemical stability 
[1,2,15]. Besides, heat treatment of α-MoO3 under inert and H2 
atmosphere can tune their electronic properties and improve their 
electrical conductivity [19,20,18]. Based on this concept, in this 
work the α-MoO3 nanoblades are post treated with various atmospheric annealing (H2, N2 and Vacuum) and their electrochemical performance are studied. 
In this study, we developed vertically aligned α-MoO3 nanoblades 
on a conducting substrate via hydrothermal reaction. These α-MoO3 
nanoblades were reduced in various reducing atmospheres to 
manipulate electrical conductivity and subsequently carbonized to 
improve electrochemical performance. A conventional supercapacitor design employing a nanostructure often involves a binder 
material for electrode preparation. Our study reports a binder-free 
hybrid electrode preparation approach, which is largely ignored in 
the literature. The hierarchal structure is achieved by decomposing a 
carbohydrate, e.g., glucose on the α-MoO3 nanoblades. These binderfree hybrid electrodes, when employed as a supercapacitor electrode, showed a maximum specific capacitance of 39.8 mF cm−2. The 
negative electrode also showed an impressive electrochemical stability of 76.4% for 10,000 charge discharge cycles. Further, the 
assembled asymmetric device 3D-MnO2//α-MoO3 delivered a maximum specific capacitance, energy density and power density of 37.5 
mFcm-2, 16.875 µWh cm-2, and 675 µW cm-2, respectively"
343_Intro.txt,"In the 21st century, the demand for green, renewable and sustainable 
energy sources have been motivated owing to the continuous deteriorative environment and over-consumption of fossil fuels, which have 
seriously impacted world economics and ecology. Intense exploration 
for eco-friendly and renewable energy sources (such as solar, wind, and 
nuclear et.al.) has been focused on [1–3]. Correspondingly, the fabrication of efficient energy storage devices to store and convert these 
generated powers became the most concerning topics [4–6]. Among 
various electrochemical energy storage devices, supercapacitors (SCs) 
were one of the ideal candidates owing to its fast charging and discharging characters, large specific capacitance (Csp) and extended 
cycling life [7–9]. The synthesis of suitable electrode materials with high 
energy and power density was especially important. On the other hand, 
the research on sustainable and green energy was extremely desired due 
to the environment problems and energy crisis nowadays. Hydrogen, as 
a clean energy source, was mainly obtained by electrochemical water 
splitting. However, the sluggish kinetics and large overpotential during 
oxygen evolution reaction (OER) impeded the efficient water splitting. 
Developing highly active, non-expensive electrocatalysts to replace the 
noble metal catalysts were urgently required for OER [10,11]. 
As a new kind of organic-inorganic hybrid functional materials, 
crystalline metal-organic frameworks (cMOFs) with metal ions (or 
clusters) interconnected by different organic ligands have sought 
tremendous attention for application [12], such as in gas adsorption and 
storage [13], heterogeneous catalysis [14], drug delivery [15], chemical 
detection[16] and also in electronic devices and batteries [17,18]. Along 
with the rapid development of synthesis technologies, a series of MOFs 
with different metals and linkers (such as MIL-53(Al or Cr), HKUST-1 
(Cu), ZIF-8(Zn), and UiO-66) have been commercialized, which makes 
them seem to be a very potential candidate [19,20]. However, the poor 
electrical conductivity and little active sites still restricted the electron 
transfer and thus limited its electrochemical applications [21]. Recently, a few studies have verified that amorphous MOFs (aMOFs) were one of 
the most promising strategies to overcome these problems. Compared to 
cMOFs, the aMOFs possessed higher conductivity and more active sites, 
ensuring the stronger electronic conductivity [22,23]. Therefore, much 
research interest has been focused on fabrication of aMOFs-based electrodes for electrochemical applications. For instance, Yu et al. synthesized an aMOF-CN composite from amorphous MIL-88(Fe) by 
ligand-competition amorphization pathway, which exhibited superior 
OER activity and stability [24]. Wang et al. reported a series of 
hetero-metallics amorphous Fe/Co aMOFs (labeled as AFC-MOFs) with 
excellent and stable OER activity, in which the incorporation of Fe3+
ions into crystalline Co-MOF led to the amorphous structure [25]. It was 
worth noting that the assembly of MOFs-based heterostructures was an 
imperative tactics to assist the electrochemical performance [26]. 
Especially, for the p-n heterojunction, the energy levels of different 
component made shift until the two components were aligned and band 
edge bending occurred within the strongly coupled interface [27]. 
Spontaneously, the charge redistribution with electron deficient/rich 
trait in n/p type semiconductor led to the competently boosted electrons 
donating/accepting abilities and conductivity [28]. Hence, the p-n 
junction could provide a platform for the rapid conduction of electrons 
and ions between the electrolyte and active material, and deserve to be 
widely used in photovoltaic and electrochemical devices, such as OER 
and SC performance. 
From the perspective of MOF matrix, cMIL-53(Al) has been considerably triggered interest due to its remarkable thermal and chemical 
stability. In particular, the cMIL-53(Al) can bear basic aqueous solution 
(pH=14) without losing its crystalline structure [29]. Meanwhile, it 
could not be ignored that the amorphous MIL materials with the simple 
amorphization have exhibited higher conductivity, more defective sites, 
and improved photoluminescence efficiency [24]. Herein, the special 2D 
aMIL-53(Al) and the derived 2D Co-LDH from the Co-ZIF have been 
properly constructed to form the p-n conjunction, which has been 
speculated to largely improve mass transfer and electron conduction 
(Scheme 1). Benefiting from the 2D/2D assembly with more active site, 
the p-n charge redistribution, and the oxygen vacancy induced by 
amorphization, the electrochemical performance, such as OER and SC 
capability, could been promoted greatly. As expected, the electrochemical studies demonstrated that the as-prepared aMC-1 exhibited 
high Csp of 773.2 F g− 1 at 1 A g− 1 in alkaline electrolyte (1.0 M KOH) and 
excellent cyclic stability with 79.1% capacity retention after 6000 
charging/discharging cycles. More interestingly, the aMC-1 composite 
also exhibited excellent OER activity with low overpotential of 278 mV 
at current density of 10 mA cm− 2 and small Tafel slope of 51.1 mV

equal importance because of their significant advantages in power density and cycling stability. 
Carbon-based electrodes are the most commonly investigated in supercapacitors, usually show 
excellent cycling stability based on electric double layer theory with continuous charge-discharge stability, and high oxygen ion diffusivity. Since the energy storage process is based on the 
incorporation of oxygen anions into the bulk oxygen, and oxygen vacancies are the carriers for 
oxygen ions, the theoretical capacitance of perovskite oxides is determined by the number of 
accessible oxygen vacancies within the perovskite lattice. Since the incorporation or de-incorporation 
of oxygen ions into/from the perovskite oxide lattice is accompanied by a change in the oxidation 
state of the B-site cation, the valence state change of the B-site cation with a low energy barrier is 
preferred. In addition, a high structural stability during operation is very important since the 
perovskite lattice is the foundation of oxygen anion incorporation, while the collapse of the 
perovskite structure will halt oxygen anion intercalation due to the loss of intercalation sites.19 To 
maximize the oxygen vacancy concentration, the A site of the perovskite lattice is usually substituted 
with alkaline earth cations (Ba2+, Sr2+). Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ (BSCF) is a benchmark perovskite 
oxide with a superior oxygen vacancy concentration, and it has found promising applications as a 
cathode material for SOFCs and as an oxygen-separation ceramic membrane and electrocatalyst for 
the oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline electrolyte at room temperature.24-26 However, we have 
demonstrated previously that the slow dissolution of Ba2+ into alkaline solution ultimately causes the 
collapse of the perovskite lattice, resulting in poor cycling stability of BSCF as an 
anion-intercalation-type electrode for supercapacitors.19
Normally, the A-site or the B-site cations are disordered and distributed homogeneously inside the 
perovskite lattice. However, under some situations, the ordering of the A-site cation with the 
formation of an A-site cation-ordered double perovskite27-29 or the ordering of B-site cation with the 
formation of a B-site cation-ordered double perovskite could occur.30-32 Cation ordering could result 
enhanced oxygen diffusivity in the perovskite oxide when used in solid oxide fuel cells.33 Therefore, 
it may also improve the oxygen diffusion rate when used as a supercapacitor at room temperature. In 
addition, cation ordering in the double perovskite is beneficial for the creation of oxygen vacancies.34
A high oxygen vacancy concentration will provide more space for the intercalation of oxygen ions, 
which will lead to a high specific capacitance when used as an electrode material in 
oxygen-ion-intercalation-type supercapacitors. For example, it was reported that the oxygen 
non-stoichiometry of Ba2Bi0.1Sc0.2Co1.7O6-δ reached as high as 0.62 (normalized as a simple 
perovskite) at room temperature, as determined based on iodometric titration; as a comparison, it was 
0.42 for BSCF perovskite.35 The above results suggest that cation ordering may be a useful strategy to develop high-performance perovskite-type oxides as oxygen-ion-intercalation-type electrode 
materials for supercapacitors. 
Herein, as a proof-of-concept, we prepared the B-site cation-ordered double perovskite oxide with 
the nominal composition of Ba2Bi0.1Sc0.2Co1.7O6-δ (BBSC) as an electrode in 
oxygen-ion-intercalation-type supercapacitors. For comparison, the oxygen vacancy-disordered 
BSCF electrode was studied, and the origin for the superiority of BBSC as an electrode in 
supercapacitors was exploited. The BBSC electrode showed higher specific capacitance and better 
stability than BSC."
70_intro.txt.txt,"he past decades, TiO2 nanomaterials have attracted muchattention from researchers due to their excellent stability, low cost,non-toxicity and broad functionality [1–4]. They arebeing studiedfor widely application in environment and energy fields, such asphotocatalysts, water splitting, solar cells, lithium ion batteries and supercapacitors [5–10]. Among various morphologies of TiO2
nanomaterials studied in recent years, one-dimensional TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNAs) fabricated by electrochemical anodization of
titanium have been considered as the promising material for various electrochemical applications because of their numerous
advantages, such as high specific surface areas, vertically oriented
nanostructure, chemical stability and simple preparation method
[11–14]. For practical application in supercapacitor, highly ordered
TNAs provide high specific surface areas and direct pathway for
electrons and ions transport, leading to a high specific capacitance
[15,16]. However, the low electrochemical activity and poor electrical conductivity of TNAs limit their application in the construction of high-performance supercapacitor [16,17]. Thereby, it is
important to explore the strategies to address these limitations
of TNAs.
It has been reported that oxygen vacancies or Ti3+ ions act as
shallow donors with relatively low formation energy and play a
vital role in determining the electrical conductivity of metal oxides[18–20], especially for TiO2 [21]. For instance, Tong’ group
reported the oxygen-deficient a-Fe2O3 nanorods obtained through
thermal treated in N2 atmosphere exhibited significant enhancement of electrochemical performance as compared to samples that
were thermally treated in air [22]. They also illustrated the oxygendeficient MnO2 nanorods prepared by hydrogenation treatment
exhibited improved capacitive performance compared to the
untreated MnO2 electrode, and yielded a large areal capacitance
of 0.22 F cm2 [23]. Salari et al. presented a facile method for controlled introduction of oxygen vacancies into TNAs, and confirmed
oxygen vacancies existed in TNAs could overcome high electrical
resistivity of bare TiO2 and thus enhanced the capacitance of
TiO2 [24]. For TiO2 nanomaterials, it is accepted that introduction
of oxygen vacancies or Ti3+ ions into TiO2 is a most important strategy to improve the electrochemical activity and electrical conductivity of TiO2, which can significantly enhance the performance of
TiO2 in supercapacitors [25], photocatalysts [26], lithium ion batteries [27,28] and so on.
Up to now, various methods have been adopted to improve
electrochemical activity and electrical conductivity of the TNAs
by introducing oxygen vacancies or Ti3+ ions into TNAs, such as
hydrogen thermal treatment [29,30], electrochemical reduction
[31,32], and chemical reduction [33]. Among various applications
of oxygen-deficient TNAs, the application of these electrodes for
supercapacitor has attracted widely attention. For instance, Lu
et al. reported that hydrogenation improved the electrochemical
performance of TNAs, and the highest specific capacitance of
3.24 mF cm2 could be yielded from TNAs by hydrogenating at
400 C [34]. They attributed the enhancement of capacitance to
the increased densities of oxygen vacancy and hydroxyl group on
TiO2 surface. Zhang’ group also reported the H-TNAs could be synthesized by hydrogenation treatment of the TNAs [35]. They
claimed that electrical resistance of TNAs was decreased and photoelectrocatalytic performance of TNAs was significantly enhanced
because of the reduced band gap and the oxygen vacancies created
by the hydrogenation process. Zhou et al. fabricated self-doped
TNAs though a facile cathodic polarization electrochemical method
to achieve enhanced electrical conductivity and capacitive properties of TiO2 [36]. The self-doped TNAs at 1.4 V exhibited the highest capacitance of 1.84 mF cm2 at a scan rate of 5 mV s1 with
excellent long-term stability.
It is worth noting that the above-mentioned methods are very
useful to introduce oxygen vacancies (Ti3+) into TNAs and improve
the electrochemical performance of TNAs. In spite of this, these
methods often have some disadvantages such as high temperature
conditions, expensive facilities, or low stabilities, which hamper
their practical applications [32,37]. Hence, it is desirable to develop
a simple and economical approach to fabricate a stable reduced TNAs electrode with enhanced electrochemical performance.
Recently, it had reported that the reduced TNAs could be fabricated
using a reducing reagent NaBH4 solution [21]. The oxygen vacancies (Ti3+) were introduced into the surface and interior of TiO2
by NaBH4 treatment, which enhanced the electrical conductivity,
improved the charge transfer rate and decreased surface recombination centers [21]. Inspired by this, it is most possible to improve
the supercapacitor performance of TNAs through the NaBH4 reduction treatment. To our best knowledge, the corresponding study
based on the TNAs treated by reducing in NaBH4 solution has not
been reported elsewhere.
Moreover, the spinel binary transition oxides have attract much
attention in the supercapacitor application in recent years because
of their low cost, eco-friendly properties and excellent electrochemical performance for achieving high-performance supercapacitor [38,39]. Among them, manganese-based spinel binary
transition oxides are useful for application in many application
fields such as catalysis, medicine, energy storage device due to
their excellent physicochemical properties and electrochemical
performances [40,41]. As used for supercapacitor electrode material, MnCo2O4 exhibits superior pseudocapacitive behavior due to
synergistic effects of Mn2+ and Co2+ cations, which manganese
can transfer more electrons and achieve a higher capacitance while
cobalt exhibits a higher oxidation potential [42]. However, their
low conductivity and typical agglomeration during long-term
charge/discharge cycling lead to poor electrochemical performance. Herein, developing an efficient strategy to essentially promote the electrical conductivity of MnCo2O4 remains a scientific
and technical challenge.
In the present work, we focus on synthesizing the reduced TiO2
nanotube arrays (rTNAs) electrodes with oxygen vacancies through
a simple one-step reduction process in the NaBH4 solution at room
temperature. As expected, the rTNAs electrodes show drastically
enhancement of electrical conductivity and carrier density compared to those of pristine TNAs. Moreover, by adjusting the NaBH4
concentration ranging from 1 to 5 M, the supercapacitive performances of rTNAs electrodes are substantially increased. In addition, the uniformly distributed MnCo2O4 nanoparticles were
deposited on the surface of TNAs by a simple chemical bath deposition method, and then the reduced MnCo2O4/TNAs with oxygen
vacancies were obtained through reduction process in NaBH4 solution. The MnCo2O4/TNAs electrode treated by reducing in 5 M
NaBH4 solution (5r-MnCo2O4/TNAs) yields a remarkably high
specific capacitance of 484.35 mF cm2 at a scan rate of 2 mV s1
and excellent cycling stability, with nearly 93.1% retention after
5000 cycles at constant discharge current of 1 mA cm2

Herein, we report a mesoporous low-crystalline cobalt ferrite
oxide combined with carbon (L-CoFe2O4/C) as an asymmetric
supercapacitor electrode material, synthesized via a citric acid
assisted sol–gel method and heat treatment process. The high
surface area of the mesoporous L-CoFe2O4/C can provide additional pores and spaces for an electrolyte to diffuse with low
transfer limitation. The introduction of carbon in the composite
material facilitates electron transfer within the framework,
which can signicantly improve the electrode material’s
conductivity. The detected oxygen vacancies and the low crystalline nature in the electrode material were found to improve
the wettability and expose more active sites which are accessible

devices owing to their intriguing advantages of high energy density, long-term operation, low

low specific capacitance with narrow operating voltage window, hence decreasing the energy

which have severely restricted the specific capacitance and lifespan. 
The first-principles calculations disclose that the oxides amorphization can generate a large 
number of unsaturated dangling bonds with the increased active sites and adsorption/desorption 
ability to ions, exhibiting a higher specific capacitance compared with the corresponding 
crystalline oxides [12]. For example, Huang et al. [13] synthesized amorphous MnO2 supported 
on carbon nanotubes by wet chemical method with a volumetric capacitance of 6.44 F·cm-3
, 
about three times higher than the corresponding crystals. Nevertheless, the amorphization is at 
the expense of electrical conductivity, resulting in low capacitance retention even at a relatively 
high-power density. According to the band theory, the oxides band structure can be regulated 
through defect engineering, which can make the valence band jump to the Fermi level, and even 
overlap the conduction band [14-16]. For example, G. B. Smith et al. [15] found that 
molybdenum oxide thin films could transform from semiconductor property to metallicity at 
high defect levels. However, it is still a big challenge to realize amorphous vanadium oxides 
with high electrical conductivity for achieving dual-high energy/power asymmetric 
supercapacitors. 
Herein, the metallic amorphous vanadium oxide nanosheet arrays have been successfully 
assembled on carbon cloth with the help of defect engineering. The oxygen vacancy content 
can increase to as high as 28.5% (donated as H-VOx-500/CC), which renders the V 3d band 
edge cross the Fermi edge and the temperature-dependent resistivity shows an increasing trend. 
The density of states (DOS) calculations also reveal the disappearance of the band gap. 
Consequently, the H-VOx-500/CC contributes an ultrahigh specific capacitance of 554 mF·cm-2
(346 F·g-1) at 1 mA·cm-2 (0.625 A·g-1) with a high capacity retention of 368 mF·cm-2 even at 
32 mA·cm-2. A 2.0 V flexible quasi-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor is assembled based 
on the MnO2/CC cathode and the LiCl/PVA gel electrolyte, also delivering a high energy 
density of 161.8 μWh·cm-2 at a power density of 0.5 mW·cm-2

74_intro.txt.txt,"Renewable and sustainable energy has attracted much research and commercialization interest much due to the 
increasing environmental concerns, and energy storage technologies capable of high energy and high power densities 
are imperatively needed to meet the rapid increasing energy demands 1-4. Supercapacitors are attractive as 
electrochemical energy storage devices in applications such as electric cars, due to their high power density, good 
charge/discharge rates and long cycling life 5-6. However, higher energy density is required for supercapacitors to 
achieve wider applications. To date, significant attention has been paid to explore and develop electrode materials 
for high-performance supercapacitors 7-9. Among these supercapacitor electrode materials, pseudocapacitive 
transition-metal oxides and conducting polymers have been extensively studied, and fast faradaic reactions render 
much higher specific capacitance and energy density than those purely based on electric double-layer capacitive 
(EDLC) carbon-based materials 10-13
.
Vanadium pentoxide (V2O5), a transition metal oxide, is promising for its low cost, material abundance, multiple 
oxidation states (V–II) that create a wide potential window, and high theoretical capacitance 14-18. However, V2O5
as a supercapacitor electrode material suffers from its intrinsically low electrical conductivity (4 × 10−4 S cm-1) and 
electrochemical instability caused by chemical dissolution or structural pulverization during fast charge/discharge cycling 19-21. The poor electrical conductivity can greatly retard the practical capacitive performance of V2O5 with 
poor charge transfer/transport, and soluble species (e.g., H2VO4
-
, HV2O5
-
, VO2+) which form in aqueous electrolyte 
during cycling processes will affect the morphology and crystal structure of vanadium oxides and lead to a serious 
capacity degradation 22-23. Various strategies have been studied to improve the electrochemical properties and device 
performance. For example, nanostructured V2O5 with much increased specific surface area or surface to volume 
ratio and much reduced dimension for short transport distance have demonstrated to be effective in improving both 
electrochemical properties and device performance 24. Engineering the surface chemistry has been another active 
research direction, such as introducing surface carbonaceous coating or surface defects. Introducing oxygen 
vacancies into transition metal oxides, such as MoO3 and MnO2 
25-26, has been reported as an effective strategy to 
retain the structures, improve the intrinsic conductivity and promote pseudocapacitive charge storage kinetics of 
redox-active materials, because oxygen vacancies can change the structural and charge storage properties of 
electrode materials. Researches on V2O5 lithium-ion batteries also show that oxygen vacancies on the V2O5 surface 
could improve the intrinsic conductivity and the cycling stability of V2O5 during repeated lithium-ion 
intercalation/deintercalation processes 27-28. A proper ratio of low vanadium valence states (like V4+) in vanadium 
oxide supercapacitor electrode materials also can restrain instability to have better pseudocapacitive performance 29
. 
Therefore, creating oxygen vacancies in V2O5 and corresponding reduced vanadium ions should be feasible to 
enhance the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors. 
Despite a long-time study of oxygen vacancies in V2O5 for batteries, most oxygen vacancies were created by 
heating V2O5 under vacuum, inert or reducing conditions (e.g. N2 or H2), electrochemical reduction and self-dropping 
30, and the effects of oxygen vacancies caused by chemical reduction, especially by the oxidative polymerization of 
conducting polymers, on supercapacitor electrode materials need to be further explored. Moreover, the distribution 
of oxygen vacancies is difficult to control directly. When the polymerization of conducting polymers starts from the 
surface of V2O5, like building a core-shell structure, the chemical reduction caused oxygen vacancies in V2O5 might 
possess an ordered distribution. At the same time, core-shell V2O5/polypyrrole nanoribbons 31 confirm that 
polypyrrole coating can improve extrinsically electrical conductivity and prevent V2O5 from pulverizing. However, 
their electrochemical performance (308 F g-1 at 100 mA g-1, 42 W h kg-1) still cannot meet daily requirements, and 
the synthesis is complicated because the polymerization of conductive polymer requires additional surfactant and/or 
oxidants (such as anionic dodecylbenzenesulfonate, FeCl3). Since multi-functional properties of materials can 
significantly enhance the electrochemical performance via the synergistic influences between intrinsic and extrinsic 
improvements, it is of great significance to identify the contribution of polymerization-induced oxygen vacancies to 
the surface morphology and electrochemical performance of vanadium-based electrode materials for better energy 
storage devices.
In this work, a gradient distribution of oxygen vacancies is induced in V2O5 nanofibers (V2O5-NF) via the in-situ
polymerization of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) at the surface of V2O5-NF to significantly boost the 
charge transfer and stability of V2O5-NF. PEDOT is used because its doped state possesses remarkable conductivity 
(300~500 S cm-1) and stability over other doped conducting polymer families, such as polypyrrole (PPy, 10~50 S 
cm-1) and polyaniline (PANI, 0.1~5 S cm-1) 11. Gradient oxygen-vacant V2O5/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) 
(denoted as G-V2O5/PEDOT) nanocables are synthesized by a vapor-phase polymerization method, which ensures 
a homogeneous PEDOT layer and renders V2O5-NF a gradually reduced concentration of oxygen vacancies from 
surface to inner. The vacuum system allows to prepare G-V2O5/PEDOT under mild conditions (80 ℃). The synthesis 
process becomes simple without additional oxidizing agents involved. Gradient oxygen vacancies and PEDOT shells 
of G-V2O5/PEDOT nanocables cause changes not only in their surface morphology, but also in their electrochemical 
performance. Applied in supercapacitors, G-V2O5/PEDOT nanocables exhibited superior specific capacitance and 
excellent cycling stability without capacitance decay after 50,000 cycles. Density functional theory calculations was 
performed and showed the role of oxygen vacancies in enhancing the charge transfer of V2O5. The morphology and oxygen vacancies of G-V2O5/PEDOT nanocables after cycling were further investigated for the excellent cycling 
performance"
75_intro.txt.txt,"The increasing demand for portable electronic devices, electric 
vehicles, and storage of renewable energy has spurred 
phenomenal development of electrochemical energy storage 
devices.1-6 Supercapacitors (SCs) are promising energy storage 
devices with a large power rate and long lifetime of over a 
million cycles. However, SCs store a relatively low energy 
density compared to lithium ion batteries (LIBs). To boost the 
energy density of SCs without compromising the high power or 
cycle life, one strategy is to construct hybrid lithium-ion 
capacitors (LICs) in which the lithium-ion battery (LIB)-like 
anodes and supercapacitor-type cathodes are paired in the 
organic electrolyte.7-11 In a typical LIC, the LIB-type anode 
provides a high capacity via the Li+
 insertion/desertion 
reaction, while the capacitor-type cathode delivers high power 
performance by fast ion adsorption/desorption.11,12 Therefore, 
a LIC can deliver a larger energy density than SC and power 
density than LIB. As the Li+
 insertion/desertion reaction at the 
battery-like anodes is slower than the ion 
adsorption/desorption process at the capacitive cathodes, it is 
crucial to develop suitable anode materials with fast Li+
insertion/desertion reaction kinetics, large capacity and good 
cycling stability for high-performance LICs. Many metal oxides 
such as MoO3, Fe3O4, MnO2, WO3, and Nb2O5 have been 
studied as promising anode materials in LICs because they can deliver higher capacities than the commercial graphite anode 
via the conversion mechanism.13-17 In particular, WO3 is an 
appealing host material for Li+
 with a large theoretical capacity 
(696 mAh g-1).18 However, WO3 has low electrical conductivity 
and poor Li+
 reaction kinetics. Moreover, WO3 undergoes large 
volume changes and phase transition during the 
lithiation/delithiation process leading to limited cycling 
lifetime and poor rate capability. These shortcomings have 
hitherto stifled widespread use of WO3 in LIBs or LICs. 
To overcome these hurdles, several strategies have been
explored. Design of the proper nanostructures and
hybridization with conducting carbon (C) materials are two 
common methods to improve the rate capability of WO3-based 
anodes by shortening the paths for Li+
 diffusion or promoting 
electron transport. For example, Duan et al.19 showed that hWO3 mesocrystals with the biconical morphology delivered a 
high specific capacity of 400 mAh g-1 after 50 
charging/discharging cycles and Liu et al.13 reported that the 
mesoporous WO3-x/graphene composite had a large capacity 
of 600 mAh g-1 at 50 mA g-1. Our previous study demonstrated 
hierarchical microspheres composed of WO3/C nanorods had 
better Li capacity and rate capability than the pristine 
hierarchical WO3 microspheres.18 Nevertheless, in spite of 
recent advances, the long-term cycling and the rate capability 
of WO3-based anodes are still unsatisfactory for highperformance LICs. 
In this paper, we describe the fabrication and electrochemical 
properties of heterogeneous phosphorus-doped WO3-x/N-doped 
carbon (P-WO3-x/NC) nanowires for high-rate and long-life anodes in 
advanced LICs. The materials are prepared by calcination and 
subsequent phosphorization of organic-inorganic hybrid 
WO3/ethylenediamine(EDA) nanowires. In the P-WO3-x/NC 
heterostructure, the P-doped WO3-x nanocrystals embedded in the 
continuous one-dimensional (1D) NC matrix. The P-WO3-x
nanoparticles offer short paths for Li+ diffusion and the continuous 
NC matrix facilitates electron transport and buffers the volume 
change of WO3-x during discharging/charging. Introduction of 
oxygen vacancies and P dopants into the P-WO3-x further enhances 
the electrical conductivity and improves the pseudocapacitive 
charge storage due to the larger degree of covalent bonding and 
electron sharing.1,20 Doping with P also generates the Li3PO4
protective coating to improve the cycling stability.20 Consequently, 
the P-WO3-x/NC nanowires have 490 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1
, high rate 
capacity of 230 mAh g-1 at 3.2 A g-1 and long lifespan with 96.2% 
retention over 2,000 cycles at 1 A g-1. A high-performance LIC with a 
voltage of 4.3 V is prepared by combining with AC cathode and PWO3-x/NC anode. The LIC prototype shows a large energy density of 
195.58 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 597.2 W kg-1 and 113.84 Wh 
kg-1 at a power density of 11945.6 W kg-1. This “hitting three birds 
with one stone” strategy, which improves the battery performance 
of WO3 via the synergistic effect of P dopants and oxygen vacancies 
as well as in situ formed conductive carbon matrix, can be extended 
to other metal oxide anodes for high-performance LICs. 
Results and Discussion
Scheme 1. Schematic illustration of the preparation of the 
heterogeneous P-WO3-x/NC nanowires. 
Scheme 1 schematically describes the preparation process of the 
heterogeneous P-WO3-x/NC nanowires. The WO3/EDA nanowires 
prepared by the solvothermal method have diameters of 20-50 nm 
and lengths up to several micrometers (Fig. S1, ESI†). The X-ray 
diffraction (XRD) pattern (Fig. 1a) and Fourier transform infrared 
spectroscopy (FTIR) spectrum (Fig. S2, ESI†) verify successful 
synthesis of the inorganic-organic WO3/EDA nanowires.21 After 
annealing in Ar at 600 oC, the WO3/EDA inorganic-organic hybrids
are converted into WO3-x/NC nanowires with EDA as the NC source 
and reductant under the Ar flow. The scanning electron 
microscopy (SEM) image (Fig. S3a, ESI†) reveals that the products 
retain the 1D structure and the transmission electron microscopy 
(TEM) images show that the WO3-x nanocrystals embedded in the 
continuous NC matrix forming heterogeneous WO3-x/NC nanowires 
(Fig. S3b, ESI†). After the phosphorization reaction, the WO3-x/NC 
nanowires are converted into P-WO3-x/NC nanowires and no 
significant morphology changes in the nanowire is indicated by the 
a displays the XRD patterns of WO3/EDA, WO3-x/NC, and PWO3-x/NC. The XRD pattern of WO3/EDA is attributed to the 
monoclinic phase WO3 (JCPDS No. 01-072-0677) besides a series of 
small-angle XRD peaks associated with the intercalated EDA. After 
annealing in Ar, the intercalated EDA is carbonized into NC and WO3
is reduced to monoclinic phase WO2.83 (JCPDS No. 36-0103) to 
produce heterogeneous WO3-x/NC (Fig. S3, ESI†). The XRD pattern 
of P-WO3-x/NC is similar to that of WO3-x/NC. However, the (022) 
and (202) peaks of P-WO3-x/NC shift to smaller angles and are 
weaker, suggesting less W-O due to partial substitution of P for O in 
WO3-x after doping of P, which is in agreement with the X-ray 
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) O1s spectrum in Fig. 2b and a  WO3-x/NC; (c) P 2p of P-WO3-x/NC; (d) (Fhν)1/2 as a function of 
photon energy (hν) of WO3/EDA, WO3, WO3-x/NC, and P-WO3-x/NC. 
P-WO3-x/NC exhibits four peaks. The ones at 710 and 806 cm-1 
correspond to stretching of O-W-O and W-O18,23 and those at 1354 
and 1598 cm-1 are the D- and G-bands of C20,24, indicating existence 
of free C in the composite. The SEM image (Fig. 1b) of the P-WO3-
x/NC hybrid reveals the 1D nanowire-like morphology with 
diameters of 20-50 nm similar to those of the pristine WO3-x/NC and 
WO3/EDA nanowires (Fig. S3, ESI†). The TEM image (Fig. 1c) shows a 
rough surface on P-WO3-x/NC and the HR-TEM image (Fig. 1d) 
discloses that the P-WO3-x nanocrystals with diameters of 5-10 nm 
are embedded in the amorphous NC matrix. The lattice fringes of 
0.38 nm corresponding to the d-spacing of (020) of WO3-x suggest 
that P-WO3-x is high crystalline. Fig. 1e shows the TEM image and Xray energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) maps of a single 
nanowire confirming the uniform distribution of W, O, C, N, and P. 
The Thermogravimetric-Differential Thermal Analysis (TG-DTA) 
curve in Fig. S5 (ESI†) show that the C concentration in P-WO3-x/NC 
is about 3.5 wt.%. Nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms of 
the P-WO3-x/NC nanowires is shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†) and the 
BET surface area is 21.48 m2
 g-1
. The results verify synthesis of PWO3-x/NC nanowires by carbonization and phosphorization of the 
inorganic-organic hybrid WO3/EDA nanowires.
XPS is conducted to determine the chemical states of WO3, 
WO3-x/NC, and P-WO3-x/NC. The WO3 nanowires are produced by 
annealing the WO3/EDA nanowires in air to remove the EDA 
molecules. The XPS survey results are depicted in Fig. S7 (ESI†) and 
the high-resolution XPS spectra of W, O and P are presented in Fig. 
2a-c. The two XPS peaks at 35.7 and 37.8 eV in Fig. 2a stem from 
3d5/2 and 3d3/2 of W6+in the WO3 nanowires. With respect to WO3-
x/NC and P-WO3-x/NC, two additional peaks at 34.9 and 36.9 eV 
corresponding to 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 of W5+ appear13,18, implying that 
WO3 is partially reduced and oxygen vacancies are produced. 
Compared to WO3-x/NC, the ratio of W5+ in P-WO3-x/NC is bigger, 
suggesting more oxygen vacancies in P-WO3-x/NC due to the partial 
substitution of O by P during phosphorization of WO3-x/NC (where x 
is 0.20). The oxygen vacancies in P-WO3-x/NC and WO3-x/NC are also 
confirmed by the fine XPS of O1s in Fig. 2b. The main O1s peak 
associated with lattice oxygen (O2-) is at 530.6 eV for WO3
nanowires. However, the peak of the oxygen vacancies at 529.5 eV 
is observed from P-WO3-x/NC and WO3-x/NC after partial reduction 
of WO3 by the NC matrix or P doping similar to the XRD results (Fig. 
1a). The O 1s peaks at 532.7 and 533.8 eV arise from P-O and P-WO, respectively. The oxygen vacancies and phosphorus dopant 
weaken W-O with ionic characteristics thereby favoring the 
reversible conversion between WO3-x and Li for enhanced capacity 
and rate capability. The P 2p spectrum in Fig. 2c suggests P-W-O 
bonding except the phosphorus species of (H2PO4)
 
H3PO4 further corroborating the formation of P-doped WO3-x with P 
content of 1.9 wt.%.20 The high-resolution N1s and C1s spectra in
Fig. S8 (ESI†) show pyridinic N (399.0 eV), pyrrolic N (399.8 eV), and 
graphitic N (401.6 eV) providing evidence that the intercalated EDA 
molecules are converted into N-doped C.26 In the C1s spectrum, a 
trace of P-C bond is observed from P-WO3-x/NC. in agreement with 
the P2p XPS spectrum in Fig. 2c. The optical bandgaps of WO3/EDA, 
WO3, WO3-x/NC, and P-WO3-x/NC are estimated from the 
reflectance spectra based on the following relationship 𝐹 = (1 − 𝑅)⁄2𝑅, (2) 
where R, F, hυ, A, and Eg are the reflectance coefficient, KubelkaMunk function of the reflectance R, photon energy, constant, and 
optical bandgap, respectively. The bandgap was determined by 
extrapolating the linear part of (Fhν)2 vs. hν at F = 0. The optical 
bandgap of P-WO3-x/NC is estimated to be 0.96 eV that is smaller 
than those of the other three samples. The smallest bandgap of the 
P-WO3-x nanocrystals stems from the higher electronic conductivity 
and lowest electron migration energy in the electrochemical 
reaction giving rise to the enhanced electrochemical Li storage 
properties. 
To investigate the electrochemical performance of the P-WO3-
x/NC electrode, half-cells are assembled using 2025-coin cells with 
lithium metal as the counter electrode. The cross-section SEM 
image of the thickness of working electrodes is about 19.0 m, 
which is illustrated in Fig. S9 (ESI†). The Cyclic voltammetry (CV)
curves are acquired to analyze the redox process. Fig. 3a shows the 
CV curves (the 3rd cycle) of the WO3, WO3-x/NC and P-WO3-x/NC 
electrodes at 0.2 mV s-1 and the largest CV area of P-WO3-x/NC 
means the largest specific capacity among the three electrodes. The 
CVs of the three electrodes at different scanning rates are 
presented in Fig. S10 (ESI†). The pair of redox peaks between 1.0 V 
and 1.5 V is associated with the reversible phase transition in the 
lithiation/delithiation process. The anodic peaks stem from 
reduction of WO3-x to W during the conversion reaction and the 
cathodic peaks arise from oxidation of W to WO3-x followed by 
decomposition of Li2O. 18, 25, 28

In P-WO3-x/NC, P is embedded in the WO3-x and the small amount of 
P (1.9 wt.%) offer additional capacity by the reaction (4) due to the 
large theoretical specific capacity of 2596 mAh g-1

This process is confirmed by the CV of P-WO3-x/NC shown in Fig. 3b, 
in which redox peaks between 0.1 V and 0.5 V could be clearly 
observed. More covalent characteristics in P-WO3-x improve the 
reversible conversion and capacity. Therefore, P-WO3-x/NC shows 
larger capacities at all the measured current density than those of 
WO3-x/NC (Fig. 3c). The P-WO3-x/NC has a large discharging capacity 
of 670 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1. At a high current density of 3.2 A g-1, the 
P-WO3-x/NC exhibit a high rate capability of 230 mAh g-1 compared 
to 10 mAh g-1 of the WO3-x/NC and WO3 electrodes as shown in Fig. 
3c. The CV curves also reflect the fundamental kinetics difference in 
charge storage by monitoring the relationship between the peak 
current (i) and scanning rate (ʋ): 
 𝑖 = 𝑎𝜐𝑏
 (5) 
where a and b are variable parameters, b = 0.5 indicates a semiinfinite diffusion process dominated by ion intercalation and b = 1 
shows a capacitive process.29 As shown in Fig. 3d, a good linear 
relationship is observed between log(i) and log(ʋ) from 0.3 to 2 mV 
s
-1 for peak A (Fig. S10) (ESI†) of the WO3, WO3-x/NC and P-WO3-
x/NC electrodes and the b values are calculated to be 0.72, 0.8, and 
0.9, respectively. The larger b value of P-WO3-x/NC close to 1 
indicates capacitive-like kinetics via a surface faradaic redox 
reaction. For the P-WO3-x/NC electrode, the P-WO3-x nanoparticles 
are small with 5-10 nm and the oxygen vacancies as well as P 
dopant increases the ratio of W with lower chemical states and 
weakens W-O bonding. Therefore, P-WO3-x/NC has enhanced 
pseudocapacitive charge storage, larger capacity, and faster surface 
faradic storage energy kinetics. The large pseudocapacitive charge 
storage is also reflected by the GCD plots in Fig. S11 (ESI†). The GCD 
curves at 0.1 A g-1 are similar to MXenes and graphene with large 
pseudocapacitive charge storage.31,32 The first irreversible capacity 
loss is due to the formation of the solid-state electrolyte (SEI) layer 
and residual phosphide on the surface of P-WO3-x/NC. Fig. 3e 
reveals the cycling stability of the P-WO3-x/NC electrode for 2,000 
cycles at 1 A g-1. The P-WO3-x/NC exhibits a large capacity of 490 
mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 with columbic efficiency close to 100% and high 
cycle stability with 96.2% retention for over 2000 cycles, which are 
much better than those of previously-reported WO3-based 
electrodes (Table S1). The large capacity and good stability of PWO3-x/NC is attributed to the synergetic effects of P and oxygen 
vacancies as well as the in situ formed conductive carbon matrix. 
The enhanced surface reactivity and fast electrode kinetics yield a 
large ratio and less energy is required during Li+
 insertion/desertion. 
As demonstrated by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy 
(EIS) in Fig. S12 (ESI†), P-WO3-x/NC electrode has small charge 
transfer resistance owing to oxygen vacancies and P dopants as well 
as conductive carbon matrix. 
The LIC is assembled using P-WO3-x/NC as the anode and AC as 
the cathode in 1 M LiPF6 in the EC-DEC electrolyte with 5% FEC as 
the additive (Fig. 4a). In the charging process, PF6

76_intro.txt.txt,"In order to address the global irreversible energy shortages and 
environmental damage, clean and sustainable green energy has attracted wide attention of the scientific community [1–3]. However, as they 
are seriously affected by the natural climate, it is urgent to develop new 
energy storage and energy conversion devices [4]. On the one hand, as a 
potential energy storage device, electrochemical capacitors, also known 
as supercapacitors, have a broad application prospect in the field of 
energy storage [5–10], due to their characteristics such as rapid charge 
and discharge rate, high power density, long cycle life and reliable security [11–15]. Nevertheless, the most important performance defect of 
supercapacitors makes their energy density lower than that of 
rechargeable batteries [16–18]. Therefore, most research work focuses 
on optimizing the electrochemical performance of electrode materials, 
boosting the energy density of supercapacitors and removing the restriction of supercapacitors in industrial production. On the other hand, 
in an energy conversion device, electrocatalytic water splitting as a 
promising way to produce clean energy consisted of hydrogen evolution 
reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), achieved OER 
required greater overpotential to achieve complete water splitting due 
to slow multi-electron reaction dynamics [19–22]. For cope with the 
higher requirements of practical applications, the in-depth exploration 
of well-designed and excellent performance of supercapacitor and 
electrocatalytic multifunctional materials has become the research 
hotspot. 
The electronic structure has an important effect on the electrochemical properties of electrode materials. Changing the surface geometry/electron structure of these materials is essential for improving 
electrochemical activity, thereby enhancing ion adsorption and accelerating electron transfer [23]. Theoretical studies have shown that the 
introduction of defects makes the electrode material close to Fermi level 
because of local electrons can be redistributed, which can effectively 
adjust the electronic structure of the surface while improving the conductivity, and further boost the electrochemical performance and electrocatalytic activity [24–26]. Common defects have point defects, line 
defects (dislocations), etc. [27]. Vacancy is one of the more common in 
the point defect [28–30], take oxygen vacancy as an example, Feng et al.  were obtained oxygen defects enriched CuCo2O4 nanoflower via thermal 
annealing in low oxygen atmosphere, the low degree of crystallinity of 
electrode material exposed to enough electroactive surface area, and to 
enhance the electrical conductivity, greatly improved the redox kinetics, 
shown a remarkable specific capacitance of 1.2 F cm− 2 under 1.2 mA 
cm− 2 [31]. Liu et al. prepared MnCo2O4@MnO2 with core–shell structure in NaBH4 solution to control oxygen vacancy concentration 
through different immersion time, and studied the effect of reduction 
time on electrochemical performance. Tests results have shown that the 
introduction of appropriate oxygen vacancies could improve the contact 
area with the electrolyte, increase the number of reaction sites and boost 
the conductivity [32]. In addition to the research of point defects, lattice 
dislocation has been explored continuously since its discovery. The 
dislocation is the boundary between the slippage and non-slippage part 
on the slip plane [33]. There is a serious dislocation of atomics near the 
dislocation, and the average energy is higher than that in the ideal lattice 
with higher activity [34,35]. In general, high surface energy can produce high electrochemical activity [36]. For example, Mariano’s group 
investigated the relationship between dislocation concentration 
captured at grain boundary and CO2 reduction. The CO2 reduction activity increased with the increase of grain boundary density, and the 
selectivity to CO was improved by inhibiting HER activity [37]. However, while studies on the importance of defects provide valuable information, the impact on multifunctional electrode materials in the field 
of energy storage and conversion has not been thoroughly studied. 
In this work, the electrode materials are obtained by a simple twostep method. Firstly, two different Co-based precursors were obtained 
by solvothermal method with or without surfactant. Then, the material 
containing surfactant was denoted as D-Co3O4 and without surfactant 
was denoted as Co3O4 by calcination in air. This 3D nanoflower structure exposed a large number of defect sites to enhance electrochemical 
activity, resulted in close contact between the electrolyte and the material, supported ion migration and electron transport. The D-Co3O4 
nanoflowers with abundant point defect was uniformly grown on the 
nickel foam substrate and showed excellent electrochemical performance. The areal specific capacitance of D-Co3O4 was reached to 1630 
mF cm− 2 at the current density of 1 mA cm− 2
, and the capacitance 
retention of about 91% over 5000 cycles examined at 10 mA cm− 2
. The 
assembled symmetrical supercapacitor (SSC) could provide a maximum 
volume energy density of 0.94 mW h cm− 3 at a volume power density of 
3.5 mW cm− 3 with excellent cycling stability, exhibited 95% of initial 
specific capacitance after 3000 cycles. Interestingly, the D-Co3O4 
nanoflower electrode material still expressed favorable specific capacitance and cyclic behavior under the conditions of low temperature (ice 
water mixture). In addition, D-Co3O4 nanoflower shown 370 mV overpotential at the current density of 10 mA cm− 2 and maintained excellent 
durability when tested as OER catalysts. These superior electrochemical 
and electrocatalytic properties were attributed to the unique 
morphology, abundant oxygen vacancies and improved electrical conductivity. The findings of this paper open up a new way for the preparation of high performance electrode"
77_intro.txt.txt,"The ever-growing focus on environment issues and the popularization of 
multifunctional electronic devices has driven the development of energy storage 
devices. Owing to the numerous advantages, for example, ultrafast charge/discharge 
rates, long cycling life and high power density, the supercapacitors have attracted 
considerable attention in the past decades. [1-3] Layered double hydroxides (LDHs), 
which are renowned for their unique dimensional structure and various advantages, 
are widely used in supercapacitors. The distinctive features, such as high redox 
activity and superior anion-exchange ability, may contribute to the high specific 
capacitance. [4] However, the applications have been restricted owing to the poor rate 
performance caused by the limited charge transport rates. [5,6]
The provision of convenient pathways for an electron is well known to be an 
effective method to boost the rate performance. The in situ growth of electrode 
materials on substrates is an efficient way to promote charge transfer. Such structures 
are free of binders, which avoids the resistance from organic polymers and ensures a 
sufficient conductivity. [7] In addition to this measure, increasing the intrinsic 
electron transport is also a key step. [8,9] Doping has been proven to be a valid 
approach to realize the goal of facilitating electron transport. It is well accepted that 
introducing oxygen vacancies into electrodes is an efficient way to promote the 
electrochemical performance. The oxygen vacancy can enhance the activity of the 
Faradaic reaction, owing to the original characteristics that can provide a better 
absorption ability of OH-
 and high electron conductivity. [10] This has been proven to 
4
be a successful method in metal oxides. For instance, Zhai et al. induced oxygen 
vacancies in MnO2 using a hydrogenation treatment and the treated MnO2 electrode 
delivered an improved electrode performance compared with the untreated electrode. 
[11] Lu et al. demonstrated a simple approach to obtain oxygen-deficient α-Fe2O3
nanorods. The obtained electrode showed a substantially enhanced electrochemical 
performance. [12] Although a number of synthetic strategies have been developed to 
create oxygen vacancies, such as hydrogenation, [13] thermal annealing [14] and acid 
etching, [15] these traditional methods may be difficult to control, and would destroy 
the structure of LDHs and the in situ growth of an electrode material. Therefore, it is 
necessary to find a facile and effective approach to create oxygen vacancies in LDHs. 
Owing to the strong reducing property, NaBH4 may create oxygen vacancies under 
mild conditions, and is much easier than hydrogenation treatment and acid etching. 
Particularly, the reactions can be performed at room temperature, so this will avoid 
the damage by high temperatures on the structure of LDHs.
Based on the aforementioned information, we aim to synthesize and engineer an 
oxygen-vacancy-rich nickel-cobalt layered double hydroxide (denoted by Vo-NiCo 
LDH) nanowires array on carbon cloth through a simple and facile method. The 
electrode should exhibit the following features: The material directly grows on the 
substrate, which is free of organic binder, thus avoiding the aggregation of electrode 
materials. The oxygen vacancies can accelerate the transmission of the electron, wich 
results in the significant enhancement of the electrical conductivity and 
electrochemical performance.

78_intro.txt.txt,"Supercapacitors (SCs) have motivated tremendous research interest 
as a state-of-the art energy storage device that fills the gap between 
conventional capacitors and batteries [1–4]. Generally, 
pseudocapacitance materials (TiO2, MnO2, Fe2O3, Co3O4, ZnFe2O4, etc.) 
show higher capacitance through surface redox reactions than electric 
double layer capacitors (EDLCs) [5–9]. TiO2 as one of typical pseudocapacitance materials has attracted immense interest for supercapacitors due to its high stability, low cost, excellent electr stability, and nontoxicity [10–13]. However, one major issue is the poor 
electrical conductivity that limits its power density and rate capability. 
To surmount this problem and improve its electrochemical performance, most of reports have been focused on designing nanostructured 
electrodes and preparing composite electrodes. For instance, anodized 
TiO2 nanotube arrays have been developed to provide a direct pathway 
for electron transport along the nanotubes to the Ti foil substrate to 
increase the electrochemical performance [14,15]. Another promising 
way is to combine TiO2 with highly conductive carbon materials such as 
carbon nanofibers and graphene [16–18]. Recently, enhancing the 
electrical properties of TiO2 through doping or creating defects has been 
developed, and the improved TiO2 are capable of charging and discharging at a very high rate [13,15,19]. Despite the above efforts, how 
to prepare TiO2-based electrode containing all the advantages (with 
small size, good stability, and high intrinsic electrical conductivity) is 
still a great challenge. 
In this work, we demonstrate a novel laser irradiation method to 
develop the oxygen-deficient TiO2/graphene hybrid (OD-TiO2/G). Our 
synthesis protocol is to functionalize the TiO2 nanocrystals by introducing defects (oxygen vacancies) through laser irradiation, and 
simultaneously by combining with graphene to achieve OD-TiO2/G 
nanostructure. It shows that the oxygen vacancies procedured on TiO2 
nanocrystals not only improve the electrochemical activity for faradaic 
redox reactions due to more active sites, but also enhance the intrinsic 
conductivity of TiO2 for fast electron transport in the OD-TiO2/G electrode. Moreover, the formed ultrafine TiO2 nanocrystals are critical to 
reduce the diffusion resistance, shorten the diffusion paths, and ease the 
mass transfer of electrolytes within the whole electrode for rapid redox 
reactions, whereas the graphene sheets effectually impede the aggregation of the TiO2 nanocrystals and facilitate the electron transport 
between adjacent oxygen-deficient TiO2 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ ¼ 1.5418 Å), FEI Quanta 250

79_intro.txt.txt,"As electrical energy-storage devices, supercapacitors 
bridge the gap between conventional dielectric 
capacitors and batteries owing to their high energy 
and power densities [1, 2]. They are generally classified 
into two—electrical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) 
and pseudo-capacitors—on the basis of the chargestorage mechanism of the electrode materials [3, 4]. 
EDLCs are based on the accumulation of charges at 
the interfaces between the electrodes and electrolytes; 
thus, the capacitance depends strongly on the surface 
area and the porous structure of the electrode materials. 
Pseudo-capacitors rely on a pseudo-redox reaction 
derived from the electron transfer between the electrode 
and the electrolyte. Transition-metal oxides (TMOs), 
carbonaceous materials decorated with functional 
groups, and conductive polymers are all candidates 
for redox reactions [2, 5, 6]. However, metal oxides 
and conductive polymers often exhibit a relatively 
poor cyclic stability and low power density, limiting 
their practical applications [7]. 
Activated C (AC) has abundant sources, a large 
surface area, and a good chemical stability, leading  to its wide utilization as an electrode material in 
supercapacitors. The surface area of AC determines 
the formation of the electric double layer, which 
dictates the speed of the pseudo-capacitive reaction. 
The pore size and pore morphology are also key 
factors affecting the electrochemical performance of 
AC [8]. The surface functionalization of AC plays an 
important role in the surface wettability and the 
introduction of pseudo-capacitance [9, 10]. Methods 
for the surface modification of AC can be categorized 
into three: the chemical bonding of heteroatoms [10–14], 
the deposition of a metal coating [15], and the incorporation of TMOs [2, 16]. As electrode materials, TMOs 
offer a high pseudo-capacitance through Faradaic 
reactions. Tailoring the microstructure and tuning the 
crystallinity of materials with a given chemical composition and crystal structure are effective methods 
for improving the electrochemical properties of TMOs 
and enhancing the performance of devices made of 
such materials [2, 7]. Combining these merits of TMOs 
with the large surface area and excellent electrical 
conductivity of carbonaceous materials has attracted 
considerable attention for the design and fabrication 
of higher-capacity electrode materials [17]. For example, 
the introduction of MnO2 nanoneedles to the AC yielded 
an excellent electrochemical capacitance, which is 
attributed to the synergistic effect of both the AC 
porous structure and the redox reaction of the MnO2
nanoneedles [18]. Similar results were reported for 
RuO2/AC [19] and Fe3O4/AC [20]. 
To leverage the synergistic merits of both ACs and 
TMOs, various synthesis and processing methods have 
been developed and examined for the fabrication 
of desired nanostructures and microstructures. Sonochemical synthesis is known as an efficient, ecofriendly, and cost-effective approach for the fabrication 
of nanomaterials or the modification of the surface 
texture of materials. During the sonochemical synthesis, 
ultrasound can induce unique hotspots with a potential 
temperature above 5,000 K, pressures exceeding 
1,000 bars, and heating/cooling rates above 1010 K/s [21]. 
Amorphous manganese-oxide-coated C synthesized 
by a sonochemical method from a mixture of NaMnO4
and C delivered an initial capacity of 273 mAh/g at a 
charge/discharge rate of 100 mA/g in the voltage 
window of 1.5–4.0 V for a Li-ion battery [22]. Lee et al. 
adopted the sonochemical method to synthesize threedimensional graphene/nanoparticle (NP) foam that 
exhibited a high specific capacitance of 421 F/g at 
100 mA/g and a capacitance retention of 97% at a 
charge/discharge rate of 20 A/g [23]. Moreover, the 
localized spots with an extremely high temperature 
and pressure generated by the ultrasonication easily 
created abrupt supersaturation, yielding a high density 
of nucleation and subsequently uniformly sized 
NPs [24]. 
This work reports the sonochemical synthesis of 
coherent Mn3O4-AC nanocomposites and their excellent 
electrochemical properties as supercapacitor electrodes 
in an organic electrolyte. Mn3O4 is characterized by 
its high theoretical capacitance, low cost, abundance, 
and eco-friendliness [25]. An organic electrolyte, 1 M 
LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate, was 
selected for its high operating voltage, which was 
helpful to obtain an increased energy density [26, 27]. 
The phases and porous structure of the resulting 
nanocomposites were characterized by X-ray diffractometry (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), 
and a nitrogen-sorption analysis. The electrochemical 
performances were investigated by cyclic voltammetry, 
galvanostatic cycling, and electrochemical impedance 
spectroscopy (EIS). The reaction mechanism of the 
sonochemical synthesis and the relationships between 
the processing, microstructure, and electrochemical 
properties of the resulting coherent Mn3O4-AC nanocomposite (labeled as AC-Mn) are discussed."
80_intro.txt.txt,"The need for materials with higher energy capacity and storage
for various applications including hybrid electric vehicles and
renewable energy sources is an ongoing issue in materials and
energy science. Many conventional battery and catalytic
materials have significant disadvantages, for example, the cost
of LiCoO2 and the difficulty in its disposal. Whereas β-MnO2 as
an electrode material and catalyst is easy to prepare, low in cost
and low in toxicity.1 The search for safer, cheaper and more
efficient energy storage materials has resulted in considerable
research of manganese oxides in recent years.2−4
One of the most important applications of β-MnO2 is as a
cathode in Li-ion batteries, although studies of bulk β-MnO2
show no significant Li-ion intercalation5,6 as a likely result of
the narrow tunnels present in the rutile structure.4 More recent

samples possess good Li-ion intercalation,7,8 high capacities5,7,9
of up to 320 mAh g−1 and good cycling stability.5 In addition,
ac impedance measurements have demonstrated increased Li

numerous catalytic processes. An example of which is its
application in electrochemical ORRs, which are essential in a
variety of energy storage and conversion applications including
metal−air batteries and fuel cells.4,11 This technology is the
basis of the Li−O2 battery system, which is an alternative to
conventional Li-ion batteries and could potentially significantly
increase specific energy density.12 An overview of other

the material, a significant increase in the capacitance (285 F

14,15 is observed when compared to the bulk material. It has
been proposed that the cause of this dramatic increase in
capacitance is a result of the greater surface area exposure as a
result of the nanostructuring.13

material, the understanding of how it drastically improves many
of its electrochemical properties is still lacking. It is only
recently that the interfaces of this material have been analyzed

81_intro.txt.txt,"The limited availability of fossil fuels and increased environmental pollution are urgently needed 
to develop the new generation energy conversion and storage technologies, which are
characterized as high efficiency, environmental protection and low cost.1-3 Owing to the highpower density, enhanced environmental compatibility, excellent cycle stability and remarkable 
security, supercapacitors have become new type energy storage equipment between batteries and 
traditional capacitors. Generally, according to the different charge storage principle,
supercapacitors can be divided into two systems.4, 5 Electrochemical double-layer capacitors 
(EDLCs) store the charge by forming the double layer or opposite ions,6, 7 generally employing
graphene,8
carbon nanotubes,9, 10 activated carbon,11 etc. as electrodes. Another is
pesudocapacitors, which via Faraday charge-transfer to achieve energy storage, and the electrode 
materials usually use conducting polymers and transition metal oxides/hydroxides, such as NiO,12, 

Compared with EDLCs, pseudocapacitors can provide much higher energy densities and thus 
have caused great attention. Because of the high theoretical specific capacitance (∼1370 F g-1
),
environmentally friendly, low cost and toxicity, abundant reserves etc, manganese oxide (MnO2)
has been become one of the typical electrodes for pseudocapacitors.
17 However, the experimental 
value of pure MnO2 is far below the theoretical capacitance, and many works has been devoted to 
enhance its electrochemical capability and poor cyclic stability. It has been demonstrated that the 
microstructure and morphology play a major role in enhancing the capability of MnO2. Thus, 
various micro/nanostructured MnO2 materials with desirable construction and high surface area
have been successfully synthesized and explored as supercapacitors electrodes, such as 
nanoneedles,18 nanofibers,
19 nanorods,20 nanosheets,21 nanospheres,22 etc. However, the poor 
intrinsic conductivity of MnO2 has not been completely solved, which will limits the transfer of 
electrons, leads to the low specific capacitance and rate capability.
Recently, numerous researches have focused on MnO2-based composites or doping MnO2 
with metals (Al, Zn, Ce, Co, Fe, etc.) to improve their intrinsic conductivity.
23-29 For example, 
Kakarla et al. designed carbon fiber fabric/coral-like MnO2 nanostructure by green hydrothermal 
method, which displayed a capacitance of 467 F g-1
at 1 A g-1
.
30 Zhou et al. reported Al doped α MnO2 showed the enhanced electrochemical performances due to the increased conductivity.31
Although the introduction of additional conductive components and metal atoms can increase the 
conductivity of the MnO2, the enhancement of the electrochemical properties is still limited. 
Therefore, to increasing the intrinsic conductivity, surface reactivity and electrochemically active 
sites are essential to significantly enhance the specific capacitance and rate performance of MnO2
materials.
Defect engineering is an effective way to modulate the intrinsic physicochemical properties 
of materials.32 Among, the introduction of oxygen vacancy has significant effect on the 
conductivity and properties of electrode materials. It has caused widespread concern that the
introduction of oxygen vacancy can significantly improve the electrochemical performance of 
metal oxide, because the oxygen vacancy can act as shallow donors to increase the carrier 
concentration and also can influence the surface electronic structure.
33 For example, Lei et al. 
reported hexagonal platelets structure of O-vacancy enriched NiO, and the electrode showed
extraordinary specific capacitance and high capacitance retention.34 Mai et al. provided an 
opportunity to illustrate the effect of oxygen vacancy on the electrical conductivity, surface area, 
and edge sites of electrode.
35 Figueiredo et al. demonstrated that the key to determining the
activity of manganese oxide was the reducibility and reactivity of lattice oxygen.
36 Despite these 
progresses, the relationship between electronic structure caused by oxygen vacancy and 
pseudocapacitance needs to be further systematically studied. Besides, the effect of oxygen
existence (such as lattice oxygen, surface oxygen, etc.) and concentration on the electronic 
structure and pseudocapacitance of MnO2 is still lacking.
In this work, the oxygen vacancy MnO2 is fabricated by a facile NaBH4 reduction or H2O2
oxidation process. We are committed to investigate the effect of oxygen vacancy on the properties 
of MnO2 by experimental and theoretical calculations. Raman spectra of treated samples have 
obviously shifted due to the reduction of lattice oxygen content. The Mn3+/Mn4+ ratio, and the
balance between lattice oxygen/surface adsorbed oxygen content have a greater impact on the 
electrochemical properties of MnO2. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations
confirm the conductivity of oxygen vacancy MnO2 is dramatically enhanced caused by additional
occupied state, which will improve the electrochemical properties of current MnO2"

their greater specific capacitance and energy density through redox reactions between 
materials and electrolytes.1-3 Transition metal oxides have attracted a large number of 
researchers’ attention due to their high theoretical capacity regarded as potential 
candidate electrode materials for energy storage devices, such as electrocatalysis, lithiumion batteries, and supercapacitors.4-8 Among all transition metal oxides, Co3O4 has 
become one of the most desirable candidates, which is expected to have ideal 
pseudocapacitance performance, great reversibility, environmental friendliness and low 
cost.9-13 Unfortunately, the charge storage capability of Co3O4 at high current density is 
not satisfactory because of its poor conductivity and low utilization rate.14-15 In order to 
improve the electrical conductivity and efficient utilization of Co3O4, several strategies 
have been proposed. For example, introducing additional metal atoms, such as Ni 16-17
and Pt,18 into Co3O4 to synthesize the nanocomposites, and surface defect engineering19-21
(vacancy or facet controlling) ,which have been proved to be efficient to enhance the 
electrical conductivity and electrochemical performance. Another strategy is an 
intelligent integration approach by creating a hybrid Co3O4 core/shell composite with 
Co3O4 as “core” structure to improve the electrochemical performance owing to the 
synergistic effect between them.22-26 Leveraging on the idea of cobalt sulfides owning 
advantages in higher electrical conductivity, thermal stability, mechanical stability and 
3 
richer redox reactions than their oxide counterparts, an emerging strategy is to connect 
cobalt sulfides with Co3O4 arrays. For example, Yang et al.27 reported 3D hierarchical 
Co3O4@Co3S4 nanoarrays which exhibited excellent electrical conductivity, delivered a 
high capacitance of 1284.3 F g-1 at 2 mV s-1 and maintained a capacitance retention of 
93.1 % after 5000 cycles. Ning et al.28 synthesized Co3O4@CoS nanosheets (NSs) on 
carbon cloth which possessed a maximum specific capacitance of 887.5 F g-1 at 10 mV s-1
and excellent cycling stability of 78.1 % capacitance retention at high current density of 5 
A g-1 after 5000 cycles. The synthesis of cobalt sulfides can be realized by various 
approaches, such as sintering of cobalt and sulfur powder between 500-700 °C,29
processing cobalt particles and H2S via chemical vapor deposition,30 phase 
transformation synthesis using cobalt oxide as template via hydrothermal method,31 and 
electrodepositing CoCl2 and thiourea in aqueous solution.32 In most case, hightemperature material processing is requested during sintering, hydrothermal and/or 
chemical vapor deposition. However, given the cost and safety issues, as well as the large 
consumption of thermal energy, high temperatures are unrealistic in energy applications. 
On the other hand, some environmentally unfriendly organic sulfides, such as thiourea 
and thioacetamide, are used as sulfurizing reagents in electrodeposition process.33-35
Therefore, obtaining hybrid Co3O4/CoxSy composites through a green, mild and facile 
approach is well considered. 
Co3O4 can be used as highly capacitive “core” and served as template to synthesize 
cobalt sulfides.28 Based on this, for obtaining high performance hybrid Co3O4/CoxSy, a 
rational method to enhance the electrochemical performance of mesoporous Co3O4 NSs 
has been proposed by introducing oxygen vacancies and further in-situ forming CoS 
4 
outer layer via ion exchange process at room-temperature. Firstly, by immersing Co3O4
NSs into solution with NaBH4, low vacancy formation energy of Co3O4 allows for 
efficient formation of oxygen vacancies with more free electrons in Co3O4 (R-Co3O4), 
resulting in significantly enhanced conductivity and electrochemical performance. 
Secondly, the solution-based ion exchange reaction has attracted widespread attention on 
account of its low cost and advantage of effectively maintaining the original morphology 
of the heterostructure after treatment. The coated CoS is synthesized via a green roomtemperature sulfurization strategy, in which the as-prepared R-Co3O4 NSs is immersed in 
a solution with a moderate concentration of S2-. The R-Co3O4 NSs are partly sulfurized 
via a slow activation of ionic exchange reaction in the solid/liquid phase due to the low 
interfacial energy level, leading to the growth of thin cobalt sulfide outer layer. 33-36 The 
moderate S2- concentration is explored to avoid the collapsion of NSs resulting from 
over-sulfurization. Importantly, for sulfurizing of R-Co3O4 successfully at room 
temperature, the preceding introducing oxygen vacancies step is essential, which allows 
for the S2- to facilitate entering the position of O2- in the solid phase. The as-prepared RCo3O4/CoS can preserves the porous NSs morphology which provides large specific 
surface area for fast ions diffusion and efficiently utilizes active Co3O4 and CoS, and help 
to improve conductivity. It exhibits a specific capacitance of 1658 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 and 
capacitance retention of 92.3% after 10000 cycles at 20 A g-1. The assembled asymmetric 
supercapacitor devices of R-Co3O4/CoS//AC show a capacitance retention of 85.7% after

affected, either detrimentally or beneficially, by low- and high-density Vo¨. Therefore, 
systematically in-depth explorations of Vo¨, including the tunable synthesis, formation mechanism, 
and their effects on energy storage is necessary. 
Our previous work introduced and demonstrated the concept of gradient Vo¨ in V2O5/PEDOT 
effectively impacting the electrochemical properties and the resulting supercapacitor performances. 
32 This work tailored the concentration of oxygen vacancies in the surface region of V2O5 nanofibers 
(V2O5-NF) by tuning the one-pot in-situ oxidative polymerization of PEDOT, and systematically 
studied the fundamental relationships between the processing conditions, concentrations of oxygen 
vacancies, the thickness of PEDOT coatings, and the electrochemical properties and 
supercapacitive charge storage performance. The concentration of Vo¨ is facilely tailored in the 
surface layer of V2O5-NF by controlling the one-pot oxidative polymerization of PEDOT, including 
polymerization duration and polymerization process repetition. Applied in supercapacitors, the

ambient with several volume ratios of N2 and O2. The effects of
ambient atmosphere on the resulting material were carefully
studied and analyzed. With the controllable volume ratio of N2 and
O2, the as-synthesized electrode (VN2:VO2 ¼ 9:1) exhibited significant improvement in capacitive performance from 0.88 F cm2

77 %). Based on the advanced structural characterizations, the
introduction of richness-enabled oxygen defects is the primary
attribution to the enhanced performance, which not only enhances
the electron/ions transportation, but also efficiently alters the wellknown capacitive surfacial reaction into bulk pattern in the chargedischarge cycles. Furthermore, the all-solid-state (ASC) with the
NCO-9 and activated carbon (AC) as electrodes (donated as NCO-9//
AC ASC) shows its specific capacitance of 67.18 F g-1 at 10 mA cm2

2. Experimental section
2.1. Material synthesis
Porous NiCo2O4 NWs were fabricated on Ni foam via a one-step
hydrothermal method combined with a post-thermal treatment.
Cobalt nitrate (Co(NO3)2), ammonium fluoride (NH4F), and urea
(CO(NH2)2) were obtained from Beijing Chemical Reagent Company. In a typical synthesis, 0.58 g of Co(NO3)2$6H2O, 0.18 g of NH4F,
and 1.2 g of CO(NH2)2 were dissolved in distilled water (35 mL) to
form a pink homogeneous solution. The solution was transferred
into Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave liners (50 mL). Then, a
piece of clean Ni foam (2  1 cm) was immersed into the reaction
solution. The top of the foam (1  1 cm) was protected from solution contamination by uniformly coating the top with polytetrafluoroethylene tape. The liner was sealed in a stainless steel
autoclave and then held at 120 C for 6 h. The Ni foam coated with
pink precursor was collected and rinsed with distilled water and
ethanol several times before drying at 70 C for 3 h. Then, the
precursor was annealed at 300 C in atmosphere (VN2:VO2 ¼ 0:1)
for 2 h, thus producing pristine NiCo2O4 NWs.
Moreover, several different mixed atmospheres of N2 and O2
were carried out to anneal NiCo2O4 precursor such as VN2: VO2 ¼ 4:
1 and 9: 1 (denoted NCO-4, NCO-9, respectively) at 300 C for 2 h.
The NCO-N was prepared by keeping NiCo2O4 precursor in a pure
nitrogen environment at 300 C for 2 h (denoted NCO-N). The active
mass was calculated by induced couple plasma (ICP) measurement,
and the average active mass was 2.6 mg (detailed information
shown in ESI)."
85_intro.txt.txt,"Supercapacitors (SCs) are appealing energy storage devices
that have gained overwhelming attention due to their high
power density, long cycling duration, safety, sustainability, and
low-cost.1-5 Rechargeable aqueous SCs will play a critical role in
large-scale deployment of intermittent renewable energy
sources,smart power grids, and electrical vehicles.6-8 Due to the
above advantages, substantial effort has been directed toward
the development of SCs with higher energy density to meet
ever-increasing requirements. In particular, much research has
targeted electrode materials which greatly affect the
electrochemical performance of SCs.9-11 Transition metal oxides
(TMOs) have promising applications in electrochemical energy
storage due to their high theoretical specific capacitance and
high energy density.12,Vanadium pentoxide (V2O5), one such TMO, is appealing in
electrochemical energy storage due to its high theoretical
capacitance (2020 F g
-1), large voltage window (up to ~2.8 V),
low cost, and abundance.14, 15 Despite these advantages, the
commercial viability of V2O5-based SCs is diminished by the low
electrical conductivity of V2O5 (10-3 to 10-2 S cm-1) and cycling
instability, leading to unsatisfactory practical performance.
Defects, especially oxygen vacancies (Vo¨), could effectively
improve the electrochemical performance of TMOs by adjusting
their electronic structure while leaving the lattice as a whole
largely unchanged.16 Specifically, Vo¨ can promote charge
transfer kinetics with a larger interlayer spacing and allows the
structure to be retained during cycling, and has thus been
proposed to improve the specific capacitance and prolong the
cycling duration of TMOs. 17-19 Conducting polymers (CPs) could
also improve the electrical conductivity of V2O5, such as
Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT),20 polypyrrole
(PPy),21 and polyaniline (PANI).22 Gradient Vo¨ on the V2O5
nanofiber (V2O5-NF) surface induced by PEDOT polymerization
demonstrated much improved electrochemical properties and
the resulting supercapacitor performance with facilitated
charge transfer kinetics, and promoted redox reactions.23 It was
further revealed that the concentration of Vo¨ at the V2O5-NF
surface through tailoring the polymerization of PEDOT has an
appreciable influence on the electrochemical properties and
device performance.24 Since all PPy, PANI and PEDOT belong to
CPs and have been widely applied in supercapacitors, it is
interesting to explore if all these three different kinds of CPs would generate Vo¨ on the surface of V2O5-NF through a similar
oxidative polymerization process, and how different CP coatings
would work synergistically with Vo¨ to influence the
electrochemical properties and performance of V2O5-NF.
In this work, Vo¨ are induced in the interface of V2O5-NF with
different kinds of CPs (CP =PEDOT, PPy and PANI) to improve
electrochemical performance of the obtained Vo¨-V2O5/CP
nanocables for high-performance supercapacitors. In the
similar oxidative polymerization process, different thicknesses
of CP coatings are obtained, and the induced Vo¨ promote the
charge transfer kinetics of resulting Vo¨-V2O5/CP nanocables by
forming a local electric field, and the accompanying V
4+ and V
3+
may also catalyze the redox reactions and improve the
supercapacitor performance. The detailed relationships
between the properties of CPs, the thickness of CP coatings, the

86_intro.txt.txt,"Synthesis of MoO3−x Nanosheets: Three samples MoO3−x nanosheets 
were synthesized via controlling the ratio of the precursors, MoO3 (Alfa 
Aesar) and MoO2 (Aldrich). For the MoO3−x-I sample, MoO3 was used as 
the precursor and the synthesis method was the same as that previously 
described.[40] For the MoO3−x-II sample, a mixture of 4MoO3:1MoO2
(weight ratio) was used as the starting material; whereas, a mixture of 
1MoO3:4MoO2 was used as the precursor for the MoO3−x-III sample. In 
a typical synthesis, the precursors (total weight was about 0.6 g) were 
refluxed in an appropriate amount of deionized water (200 mL) for 5–7 d 
at 80 °C. The resulting suspension was then centrifuged at 13500 rpm 
for 5–10 min. The large crystals of MoO3 and/or MoO2 could then 
be decanted, whereas, the exfoliated MoO3−x nanosheets remained 
dispersed in the water. The dark blue supernatant was collected and dried 
at 80 °C for 5–8 h to yield a black-blue powder of MoO3−x nanosheets. The 
yield ranged from 50% to 60% depending on the concentration of the 
reacting molybdenum oxides. As the concentration of the reactant was 
increased, the yield of the MoO3−-x nanosheets decreased. In particular, 
the yield for MoO3−x-I and MoO3−x-II samples varied between 50% and 
60%; whereas, the yield of MoO3−x-III sample ranged from 30% to 50%. 
It is worth noting that the by-products of the exfoliation method were the 
remaining unexfoliated bulk materials, which in theory can be dried and 
reused as precursors for the subsequent synthesis run.
Characterization Techniques: The structure of the prepared materials 
was studied with powder XRD (Panalytical diffractometer, Cu Kα1
radiation) in the 2θ range 4–40°. The morphology of the materials was 
also examined in TEM (JEOL-JEM-2100F, 200 kV accelerating voltage) 
and SEM (JEOL-JSM-7401F) experiments. The XPS experiments were 
performed using AXIS Ultra instrument (Kratos Analytical Ltd.) with 
monochromatic Al Kα radiation (hν = 1486.7 eV). The binding energies 
were calibrated to the C 1s peak of (CC) and (CH) bonds (284.8 eV).
Solar Light Irradiation and UV–vis–NIR Measurements: 0.015 g MoO3−x
powder was dispersed in water/EtOH (1:1 v/v%, total 30 mL), sonicated for 
5 min, after which the samples were irradiated using a solar-lamp (36 W) 
for periods ranging from 10 min up to 5 h. Prior to the UV–vis–NIR 
measurements, the samples were diluted, and a spectrum was then 
recorded in the 350–1200 nm wavelength region. To explore the effect 
of secondary reducing agents on the LSPR, an appropriate amount 
of reducing agent (0.25 mL of 1 m oxalic acid) was added to 10 mL of 
MoO3−x dispersion in water/EtOH (1:1 v/v%) and then irradiated with 
solar lamp for 1 h. To examine the effect of atmospheric oxygen on the 
LSPR, a couple of samples were irradiated for 1 h, and then stored either 
under ambient conditions or Ar-filled glove box.
Electrochemical Measurements: All supercapacitor experiments were 
done with a three-electrode setup including a Pt-mesh as the counter 
electrode, and a Ag/AgCl/3.5 m KCl reference electrode. The binderfree working electrodes were prepared by drop casting an aqueous 
suspension of the MoO3−x nanosheets onto a piece of carbon paper 
(Quin-Tech, H23), and the mass loading ranged from 6.25 to 50 µg cm−2
. 
A series of 1 m Na2SO4 solutions with different pH values were tested 
as the electrolyte. The pH was varied by adding 0.1 m H2SO4 to the 1 m
Na2SO4 (Aldrich) solution. The electrochemical analysis was done in the 0.0–
0.8 V (vs Ag/AgCl/ 3.5 m KCl) potential window using cyclic voltammetric 
experiments employing scan rates between 5.0 and 1000 mV s−1
.
In the lithium-ion battery experiments, the electrochemical behavior 
of the MoO3−x nanosheets was studied using cyclic voltammetry and 
galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements in the 0.1–2.8 V (vs Li+/Li) 
potential window. All experiments were performed using a two-electrode 
pouch cell containing a lithium metal counter electrode and a piece of 
a glass fiber separator (Whatman). 1 m LiPF6 in 1:1 mixture of ethylene 
carbonate (EC):diethyl carbonate (DEC) was used as the electrolyte. 
The working electrodes were fabricated by casting a slurry [80% of the 
active material, 10% carbon black (super C65 Imerys), and 10% of 
polyvinylidene fluoride binder (Arkema)] on a copper foil. The working 
electrodes were dried under vacuum at 120 °C prior to the electrochemical 
measurements, and the mass loading was varied between 5.0 and 
5.25 mg for circular electrodes with a diameter of 13 mm."
87_intro.txt.txt,"Recently, the enormous challenges of fossil fuel depletion and
environmental pollution have prompted us to develop sustainable
and clean alternative energy sources [1e3]. New energy storage
system like the lithium-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries and
supercapacitors are the promising candidates for next-generation
electric devices [4e7]. Supercapacitors have attracted great interests owing to their high power density, fast charging/discharging
characteristic and long cycling life (>105
) compared to conventional
secondary batteries [8e10]. And pseudocapacitors have drawn
more attention due to their higher charge storage capacities based
on Faradaic reactions compared with electrical double layered
capacitance (EDLC) which only carry through ionic adsorption/
desorption at the electrode interface [11,12]. However, there are still
challenges to develop excellent pseudocapacitor electrode
materials.
Ternary metal oxides have become promising pseudocapacitors
electrode materials because of their merits of multiple valences,
rich redox reaction and excellent stability, making them have
higher electrochemical performance compared with the binary
metal oxides [13,14]. In particular, the Co cation partially
substituted by a transition metal (e.g., Cu, Zn and Mn) cation have
similar advantages such as low cost, natural abundance, environmental friendless, rich redox capability and better electrical conductivity compared with their binary metal oxides, however, the
manganese-based oxides has a more variable valence state than
that of Cu or Zn [15,16] and MnCo2O4 has higher electrochemical
activity than Co3O4 or MnO2, so in this work we choose MnCo2O4 as
electrodes for supercapacitors [17,18]. Different specific structures

been used for MnCo2O4 to improve their supercapacitor performance. However, single and simple structured MnCo2O4 can hardly
achieve a satisfactory actual specific capacity [22]. The construction
of core-shell nanomaterials grown directly on current collectors is
widely used as an effective strategy to obtain supercapacitors materials with excellent properties, such as NiCo2O4@NiWO4 [23],
MnCo2O4@NiMn layered double hydroxide [22] and NiMoO4@CoO
[24]. All these reports demonstrate that the core-shell nanomaterials can effectively increase the contact surface area and
electrochemical reaction sites, and allow the synergistic interactions between different components and structures. MnO2 is
known as an ideal “shell” material for pseudocapacitors, and used
on various “core” materials with different ingredients and shapes,
which can be attributed to its low cost, high theoretical specific
capacitance (1370 F g1
) and easy preparation (easily obtained by
thermal decomposition of KMnO4) [25e27]. So, it is expected the
core-shell structured MnCo2O4@MnO2 could further improve its
electrochemical properties as supercapacitor.
Defect engineering of introducing oxygen vacancies has been
proven to be another powerful strategy that can tune the surface
chemistry configuration, improve electrical conductivity and create
more electrochemical active sites, all of which are beneficial for
electrochemical properties [28e30]. For example, Fu et al. [31]
synthesized yolk-shell structured MnO2 with oxygen vacancies
induced by heating in a H2/Ar atmosphere and show remarkable
capacitance performance. Sun et al. [32] introduced oxygen vacancies via annealing in N2 and O2 atmosphere to improve the
supercapacitor performance of NiCo2O4 electrodes. All these
methods for obtaining oxygen vacancies by annealing in a reducing
atmosphere may not be practical due to its cost and safety considerations. Alternatively, NaBH4 solution treatment of reducing
samples at room temperature can be a facile method to introduce
oxygen vacancies for supercapacitor electrodes [33,34]. The content
of the oxygen vacancies can be easily tuned by treated time in
NaBH4 solution. Based on the above considerations, reduced coreshell structured MnCo2O4@MnO2 nanosheet arrays with oxygen
vacancies would be suitable for supercapacitors and have not been
reported yet.
Herein, based on overall consideration, reduced core-shell
structured MnCo2O4@MnO2 (rMnCo2O4@rMnO2) nanosheet arrays with oxygen vacancies grown on Ni foam have been prepared
via two-step hydrothermal process with facile annealing and
NaBH4 solution treatment, and different NaBH4 reduced times have
been employed to adjust the content of the oxygen vacancies. The
rMnCo2O4@rMnO2 core-shell structured nanosheet arrays with
appropriate oxygen vacancies can not only take full advantage of
the effects between different components and avoid agglomeration, but also increase the electrical conductivity and create more
electrochemical active sites through a simple NaBH4 reduction
treatment. Moreover, the electrodes directly grown on nickel foam
are conducive to ion exchange for redox reaction. The synergistic
effect of the core-shell nanosheet arrays and appropriate oxygen
vacancies jointly improve the overall electrochemical performance"
88_intro.txt.txt,"Electrochemical double layer capacitor (EDLC) is regarded as the
most efficient electrochemical energy storage device, owing to its
higher power density, faster charge-discharge speed and longer
life-time [1]. However, one of the limiting factors of supercapacitors

attention [3e6]. Among various pseudocapacitive compounds,
transition metal-based materials such as oxides [7,8], hydroxides
[9e11], and phosphides [12e15] have been widely investigated as
pseudocapacitive materials, because of high capacitance, high
abundance in earth with lower cost. In recent years, NiCo2O4 has
been selected as a potential electrode material with in pseudocapacitive materials owing to its high theoretical capacity, abundant
natural resources and good environmental friendliness [16e19].
However, the NiCo2O4-based electrode material are facing some
drawbacks, such as the lack of electrochemically active sites, the
inherent sluggish of reaction kinetics, the poor electronic conductivity, and slow electron transfer rate. Accordingly, the electrochemical performance of NiCo2O4-based electrode material still not
meeting the demand [20,21].
To solve these setbacks, several methods have been explored.
For example, surface modification of transition metal oxides is
considered to be an effective strategy for accelerating reaction kinetics, achieving higher electrochemical performance [22,23]. A
typical successful case is recently reported that low crystallinity

activity and surface reactivity. Due to the decrease in crystallinity,
the amorphous nanostructure with more grain boundaries promotes the penetration of the electrolyte, thereby ensuring more
exposed active sites for rapid redox reactions. Additionally, oxygen
vacancies are caused by grain boundaries, favorable for the increase
of conductivity [25,26]. For example, Duc et al. revealed that ultrasmall and low-crystalline CoMoO4 nanorods prepared by hydrothermal/solvothermal methods, and has high specific surface area
and excellent electrochemical performance [27]. Zeng et al.
demonstrated that the phosphate ions NiCo2O4-x nanosheets were
annealed by a simple phosphating process. Benefiting from the
enriched oxygen vacancies, the conductivity is greatly improved

the low crystallinity NiCo2O4 electrode material is expected to

89_intro.txt.txt,"Hollow microstructure with controllable morphology is gradually attracted to
fabricate materials applied on the photocatalysis [1], battery [2], supercapacitor [3],
solar cells [4] and gas sensor [5] due to its large specific surface area. There are various 
approaches performed on the fabrication of a hollow microstructure. The hard template 
method is popularly used for the preparation of hollow microstructure and the template 
involves carbon spheres [6-7], silica [8-9], calcium carbonate [10-11], and so on.
Nevertheless, the synthesis of the hard template is always costly and removing the 
template is complicated. Also, it requires special corrosive acids [12]. Another soft 
template method is highly controllable and easy to fabricate the hollow microstructure
[13-15]. It utilizes the cooperative assembly of structure-guiding reagents (surfactant, 
vesicles, etc). Although the approach avoids the removal of the soft template, it easily 
introduces impurities in the sample. 
To prepare the metal oxides with hollow microstructure, metal-organic 
frameworks (MOFs) as the promising templates are newly reported owing to their high
surface area and tunable microstructure [16-17]. In the sequent process of thermal 
decomposition, the porosity of MOFs provides convenience for gas escaping, resulting 
in the construction of hollow architectures inheriting the unique morphology of MOFs.
Therefore, the desired metal oxide with a hollow microstructure can be synthesized

outstanding performance in lithium-ion batteries [18]. CdS hollow microcubes was 
synthesized from MOF precursor and the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate was 
2.4 times than CdS particles [19]. Hollow NiCo2O4 nanowall arrays were obtained from 
2D cobalt-based wall-like MOFs and displayed promising electrochemical and 
electrocatalytic activities [20]. Recently, the studies on the gas sensor derived from 
MOF template are reported. SnO2/NiO composites were prepared by calcining MOF 
templates and the gas response was three times than of pristine SnO2 toward 
trimethylamine [21]. Porous Co3O4 were fabricated by annealing Co-MOF and 
exhibited good sensitive n- butanol sensing [22].
As a pungent and hazardous gas, chlorine gas (Cl2) is very important to our lives. 
For example, the disinfection of drinking water and swimming pools is related to or 
containing chlorine. Beyond 30 ppm, Cl2 inhalation toxicity can make it immediately 
uncomfortable about cough and chest pain [23]. However, the studies on Cl2 sensor are 
seldom compared with other gas sensors and mainly about semiconductor metal 
oxides.[24-27] For example, ZnO nanoparticles were prepared by solid-state strategy 
and the gas response was just about 4 to 10 ppm Cl2 at 200 °C.[28] CdSnO3 sensor was 
fabricated by hydrothermal process and showed high sensitivity to Cl2 (1338.9 to 5 ppm) 
at room temperature. But the recovery time is too sluggish to be applied in practice.[29]
In2O3 microstructures were synthesized by hydrothermal route and the sensitivity was 
48.5 toward 10 ppm Cl2 at higher working temperature (300 °C).[30] Therefore, the 
development of Cl2 gas sensor with excellent gas performance is significant and 
imperative. For Cl2 gas sensor, however, there are few reports about the hollow 
microstructure derived from MOFs template. In this work, In2O3 porous hollow rods 
(PHRs) are constructed via a facile hydrothermal method and subsequent thermal 
treatment of In-MOFs. The obtained In2O3 PHRs show the hexagonal structure and 
large specific surface area (45.15 m2

sensor exhibits outstanding gas response (2256), good selectivity (6.3), low detection

Particularly, the optimal operational temperature (160 °C) is lower than many Cl2"
90_intro.txt.txt,"We are heading toward a more sustainable future by utilizing cost effective solar and wind power 
in addition to electric vehicles. These technologies are creating greater demand for next 
generation energy storage with low cost and rapid charging capabilities. Whereas lithium ion 
batteries have a high energy density, the charging times are long. With this in mind, applications 
that require fast charging rates such as electric vehicles or high power as is the case 
scale electric frequency regulation could be addressed by high power electrochemical 
pseudocapacitors.1
Pseudocapacitors utilize faradaic charge transfer via either underpotential deposition, 
redox pseudocapacitance, or ion intercalation pseudocapacitance2
 in contrast with electric 
double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) that store electrical charge in the form of double layers at a 
surface-electrolyte interface. The reader is advised to see Conway2
 and Augustyn3
 to find more 
detailed explanations about these mechanisms. Pseudocapacitive behavior is indicated by 
current-voltage curves with redox peak currents that are linearly proportional to the scan rate (ν)
superimposed onto the general rectangular shape in an EDLC’s profile.2
 This means the 
capacitance is not always constant over the potential window and the material is thus said to 
exhibit pseudocapacitance. A capacitor’s energy density is given by equation 1:
𝐸 = (1) 1

where E is the energy density (Wh kg-1), C is the specific capacitance (F g-1) of the electroactive 
material, and Vcell is the applied cell voltage. Because of the square-power dependence on Vcell, 
non-aqueous pseudocapacitor materials such as high surface area carbons,4,5 V2O5,
6 α-MoO3,
7
 TNb2O5,

 TiO2 nanotubes,9
 etc. have been explored as solutions due to the electrolytes’ larger 
electrochemical potential stability window.3,5,10 Industry has already commercialized early nonaqueous carbon based supercapacitors capable of storing 4 Wh kg-1 when charging at 400 W kg-1
but these devices do have disadvantages such as the high cost of the electroactive materials and 
organic electrolytes, lower power and capacitance relative to aqueous electrolytes, safety 
concerns, and low water impurity requirements (3-5 ppm) for proper performance.10,11
 Aqueous electrolytes afford low solvent costs and toxicity, high electrolyte 
concentrations for high power, and a wide operating temperature range. These advantages may 

be limited for non-aqueous counterparts.10,12 Aqueous electrolytes span the entire pH range with 
acidic, neutral, and alkaline solutions commonly containing ~ 5 M H2SO4, 0.5 M Na2SO4 and 1 
M or 6 M KOH respectively.12 The breadth of pseudocapacitive materials that have been studied 
is vast and includes high surface area and functionalized carbons, RuO2,

 MnO2,

 IrO2, 
NiO/Ni(OH)2, Co3O4/Co(OH)2, SnO2, V2O5, etc. as reviewed elsewhere.3,5,10,12 A strategy to 
increase the pseudocapacitor energy density has been to expand the working voltage window 
with an asymmetric design. For example, a pseudocapacitive material as the positive electrode 
may be coupled with a negative electrode, typically a high surface area carbon relying on nonFaradaic double layer ion-adsorption.12 Examples include TiO2/MnO2
13 and MnO2-
SWCNT/In2O3-SWCNT14 asymmetric pseudocapacitors to name a few. The shear breadth in 
pseudocapacitor type, structure, composition, and testing procedure reported in the literature 
makes it difficult to compare the performance among studies.
We previously demonstrated an oxygen vacancy rich LaMnO3 perovskite with excellent 
pseudocapacitance based on a hydroxide anion intercalation mechanism .15 In subsequent work 
we demonstrated that the redox potential of the B-site can be shifted by substituting higher 
oxidation state elements with lower ones, for example, La3+ with Sr2+ in the A-site. This 
substitution must be compensated for by either oxidizing the B-site or introducing oxygen 
vacancies in order to maintain charge neutrality.16,17 We have shown that the anion intercalation 
mechanism is affected by the oxygen vacancy content (δ) and can be described in a perovskite 
for a given transition metal B as:
La1 ― (2) xSrx
[B

2δ ;B

― +δH2O↔La1 ― xSrx

(z + 1) +
(1 ― 2δ) ]O3 ― δ +2δOH ―

To put it simply, the more oxygen vacancies that are present in the lattice means there are more 
places for OH-
 ions to fill and thus increase the amount of stored charge. Recently, others have 
demonstrated anion-based pseudocapacitance in BSCF,18 SrCo0.9Nb0.1O3-δ,19 LaNiO3,
20 La1-
xSrxMnO3 (x = 0-0.5)21 and furthermore have made either symmetric or asymmetric 
pseudocapacitors with activated carbon as the anode. For instance, Liu18 studied BSCF and 
hexagonal SrCoO3 and found that cation leaching during cycling increases the perovskite surface 
area and the resulting pseudocapacitance. Additionally, we have previously noted oxygen ion 
mobility in electrocatalytic applications in the La1-xSrxCoO3-δ (x = 0-1) series.16
Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of the structural and electrochemical 
properties of a library of perovskites with the composition La1-xSrxBO3-δ (x = 0-1; B = Fe, Mn, 
Co) to provide and understand the phase space for designing asymmetric anion-based 
pseudocapacitors with wide voltage windows. Perovskite oxides offer a robust platform to tune 
their electrochemical properties via elemental substitution in their A and B-sites. By using a 
perovskite material capable of faradaic charge transfer as the anode in place of a typically used 
activated carbon, we widen the cell voltage window and increase the amount of charge stored per 
unit area. Moreover, we show that the iron, manganese and cobalt series’ surface areanormalized capacities increase linearly with oxygen vacancy content. The material with the 
highest pseudocapacitance was La0.2Sr0.8MnO2.7 yielding 492 F gox
-1 at 5 mV s-1. Since each Bsite element has its own characteristic redox peak potential, two perovskites could be chosen to 
achieve a large voltage window up to 2V for a high pseudocapacitance. Thus, we have 
constructed the first all-perovskite asymmetric pseudocapacitors using the most pseudocapacitive 
materials from each transition metal perovskite series for high cell voltage with a large energy 

density, namely 31 Wh kg-1 at 450 W kg-1 for Brownmillerite Sr2Fe2O5 as the anode and 
SrCoO2.7 as the cathode.

91_intro.txt.txt,"Electrochemical supercapacitors hold a unique position in
energy storage applications because of their high power density,
which translates to quick charge/discharge cycles and potential
for high stability. However, the key-limiting factor in supercapacitors is their lower storage capacity relative to that of batteries or
other high energy density storage devices, which arises from the
charge storage mechanisms used in supercapacitor devices. That
is, since supercapacitors store charge through the electric doublelayer, they have the ability to charge and discharge quickly, as ions
from the electrolyte adsorb on and desorb from the surface of the
electrode. Because the number of ions that can gather at the surface isdirectlyproportionalto the electrode surface area,the energy
storage capabilities of electrodes can be increased through the texturization of electrode surfaces. Improvements in capacitance due
to the electric double-layer are often achieved by using high surface
area materials with high intrinsic capacitances, such as porous carbon, activated carbon, or vertically-aligned carbon nanotubes [1,2].
These supercapacitors charge and discharge quickly, as the charge
is highly mobile and the charge layer forms only at the surface of
the material. In contrast, lithium-ion batteries have relatively slow
charge/discharge cycles, as ions must intercalate themselves into the material. Moreover, during the process of intercalation, electrodes may become susceptible to damage. For example, silicon,
known as one of the highest energy density lithium-ion battery
materials, can expand up to 400% upon intercalation [3]. In contrast,
damage in double-layer supercapacitors is minimal, since charge
simply gathers on the surface and does not insert itself into the
electrode area.
The second mechanism of charge storage in an electrochemical
supercapacitor is achieved by a Faradaic redox reaction occurring
at the surface of the electrode, referred to as pseudocapacitance.
In contrast to intercalation processes, these processes are much
faster since they occur only on the surface layers of the electrode.
However, many pseudocapacitors suffer from poor stability, since
electrodes may experience damage from ion insertion. These two
mechanisms of supercapacitor charge storage, when employed
in tandem, can dramatically increase charge storage capacity,
depending on the device architecture and mode of pseudocapacitance. For example, prior works using conductive polymers [4],
nickel nanoparticles [5], or ALD RuO2 loading [6] onto VACNT forest electrodes have shown up to 170 times higher capacitances
by employing pseudocapacitance. However, the resulting polymer
and nickel depositions are not IC compatible and have limited
enhancements in capacitance, while the RuO2 is expensive and not
suitable for large-scale production. Here, we examine the possibility of using titanium nitride as an alternative material for MEMS
supercapacitor applications, since TiN is a standard material in I processes and processing techniques and applications in ICs for TiN
have been well explored.
Atthe macro scale,titanium nitride films have been known to be
physically stable, with exceptional hardness, and are thus widely
used as protection coatings in tool manufacturing. Although chemically classified as a ceramic, titanium nitride has good electrical
conductivity and serves well as diffusion barriers for electronic circuitry. Recently, TiN has been studied for energy storage devices,
such as capacitors [7] and battery electrodes [8,9], because of its
good electrical conductivity and electrochemical performance.
For applications in electrochemical supercapacitors, control
over deposition upon irregular surfaces is central to optimizing
performance. However, previous titanium nitride supercapacitors
have been limited in geometry or surface functionalization due to
the difficulty of precise control in the fabrication process. These
electrodes have previously been fabricated through either a twostep, high temperature process, which limits selection of high
surface area electrode materials [10,11], or by sputtering with
poor conformality and coverage [12]. Here we present results from
depositions of angstrom-level precision ALD TiN onto porous CNT
forest electrodes, which demonstrate outstanding performance in
the supercapacitor electrode applications."
92_intro.txt.txt,"With the development of renewable wind and solar energy, the
efficient electrochemical energy storage devices are becoming
increasingly important.1,2 Supercapacitors (SCs) are considered as a critical member for future energy storage devices
owing to their high-power density, excellent cycling behavior,
and fast charge−discharge performance.3 The electrochemical
performance of SCs can be highly related to the physicochemical characteristics of electrode materials. Recently, intense
efforts have been undertaken to develop SC electrode materials
with high performance, including heteroatom-doped carbon
materials,4−6 conducting polymers,7,8 metal sulfides,9 transition-metal phosphates,10,11 transition-metal hydroxides/oxides,12−14 and so on. Among them, transition-metal oxides
generally have much higher specific capacitance for charge
storage than the other electrode materials.15,16 In particular,
Co3O4 is a highly desirable electrode material owing to its
environmentally benign nature, low cost, and high theoretical
capacitance (3560 F g−1
).17 Due to slow ion diffusion pathway
and poor electron transport, however, the reported capacitance
values are still much lower than the theoretical capacitance and
capacity retention is also unsatisfactory.18
Employing Co3O4 with different morphologies is an effective
approach to mitigate these problems, which includes nanosheets (NSs),19−21 nanoparticles,22 nanocages,23 nanorods,24
nanotubes,25 and so on. Among various morphologies, twodimensional (2D) NSs with high surface area can improve
atomic utilization and achieve enhanced electrochemical
performance.26 It is well known that the Faradaic redox
reaction process for pseudocapacitors involves the adsorption/
desorption of ions or protons within the surface and the first
few nanometers beneath the surface of active materials.27 Thus,
2D NSs can greatly improve the efficient usage of active
materials and shorten the ion/electron diffusion path distance
during charge/discharge processes.28
Recently, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are generally used to
serve as carbon supports, which can not only buffer volume
change during the charge/discharge process but also enhance
the contact area between the electrolyte and the electrode
material.29,30 For example, Zhou and co-workers successfully
prepared hollow NiCo hydroxides/CNTs nanocomposites
using an etching strategy, which exhibited a significant
improvement in structural stability and specific capacitance
compared to NiCo hydroxides without CNTs.31 Xue and coworkers successfully prepared porous NixCo3−xO4/CNTs
nanocomposites by in situ growth of the ZIF-67 precursor 
onto CNTs and subsequent calcination,32 which exhibited a high specific capacitance value of 668 F g−1 at 1 A g−1
, good
cycling performance of 91.2% retention after 3500 cycles, and a
good rate capability of 91.60% retention from 1 to 10 A g−1
.
Furthermore, the introduction of oxygen vacancies is
another efficient method to boost the electrochemical
performance of Co3O4 materials.33 The introduction of oxygen
vacancies to the metal oxide has many advantages. First,
oxygen vacancies can act as an electron carrier and as active
reaction sites during the charge/discharge process, which
promotes the ion/electron transport and accelerates the
Faradaic redox reaction and consequently improves the
electrochemical performance.34 Second, oxygen vacancies can
make changes in the structural and chemical characteristics of
the active electrode materials without sacrificing the structural
stability.35 Finally, oxygen vacancies can efficiently cause the
formation of the built-in electric field in the level of atom,
resulting in significant improvement in the electrochemical
performance.36 At present, various synthetic strategies have
been developed to create oxygen vacancies in electrode
materials, such as gaseous thermal treatment,37 electrochemical
treatment methods,38 and chemical reduction treatment (such
as N2H4 and NaBH4).39,40 Among them, the NaBH4 treatment
strategy is very simple and efficient. For instance, Wang and
co-workers successfully prepared the mesoporous Co3O4
nanowires by treating the Co3O4 nanowires with NaBH4,
which showed an improved capacitance and reduced charge
transfer resistance compared to initial Co3O4 nanowires.34
Tang and co-workers successfully prepared Co3O4-NSs using
Co-metal organic frameworks as a precursor and further tuned
its interfacial features by NaBH4. The optimal Co3O4-NSs/CC
nanocomposites had excellent overall capacitive properties,
including high specific capacity value (920 F g−1 at 1 A g−1
)
and high stability (0.00174% capacity loss per cycle for 15000
cycles).41
In this work, the addition of NaBH4 not only promotes the
formation of ultrathin Co3O4-NSs but also produces more
oxygen vacancies, which can act as the active sites for Faradaic
redox reactions and boost the electrochemical performance of
Co3O4. Meanwhile, the 2D ultrathin morphology of Co3O4-
NSs results in abundant active sites and effectively shortens the
electron/ion diffusion path distance during charge/discharge
processes. Additionally, CNTs serve as an excellent support,
which not only offers a flexible substrate to prevent the
structure damage during the charge/discharge cycling but also
enhance the contact area between the electrolyte and the
electrode material. The optimal Co3O4-NSs/CNTs nanocomposites with 5% CNT mass show good rate performance,
capacity retention, and stability, which can be ascribed to the
2D ultrathin morphology of Co3O4-NSs, the existence of
oxygen vacancies, and the synergy effect between CNTs and
Co3O4-NSs"
93_intro.txt.txt,"To reduce the reliance on a dwindling supply of fossil fuels and to act on climate change, there 
is a global urge to switch to clean energy sources which has led researchers to explore 
renewable energy resources. Renewable energy resources (such as wind, solar, hydropower, 
geothermal) could be potential alternatives to the existing non-renewable fossil fuels. However, 
the intermittent nature of renewable energy generation is generally considered as the main 
drawback making reliable energy storage a crucial factor.1
 Rechargeable batteries and 
supercapacitors need to combined with renewable power sources to create systems that can 
provide electricity even when wind is not blowing, or sun isn’t shining. To achieve this goal, 
the energy storage technologies should meet certain requirements to be suitable for integration 
into existing power generation networks.2
 The critical attributes are high storage capacity, 
quick charging and discharging, long life span, high efficiency, and low environmental 
repercussions.3
 The overall performance in terms of energy storage entirely depends on the 
chosen electrode material and its underlying electrochemistry.4
 A wide range of binary, ternary, 
and quaternary composites of metal oxides, sulphides, phosphides, phosphates etc. have been 
extensively researched as active inexpensive electrode material for energy storage applications 
over the past decade.5–12 However, there have always been some limitations with regard to cost, 
life time, efficiency, and safety. 
Metal molybdates and their composites are of great significance as they have 
demonstrated improved capacitance and cycle stability.13–16 Moreover, among the available 
metal molybdates, nickel molybdate (NiMoO4) is of much interest and widely reported as it is 
chemically inert, low cost and shows improved electrochemical performances.17–19 Recent 
work on NiMoO4 highlights its importance as an efficient energy storage material.20, 21 From 
the electrochemical perspective, Ni contributes as an excellent redox material, whereas, Mo 
favours the conductivity.18 The major problems associated with transition metal oxides are their marginal electronic conductivity and an extensive volume change.22 To overcome these 
hurdles, incorporating suitable metal cations and rationally designing a nanostructured material 
has proven as a suitable strategy to achieve improved redox reaction.23,24 This has stimulated 
the wide exploration of different dopants in the host metal molybdates. This current work 
therefore focusses on one-dimensional Zn-doped nickel molybdates, which represent a diverse 
and largely untapped system. 
One-dimensional nickel molybdate nanorods have been fabricated, and in an attempt to 
enhance the conductivity of the active sites, metal cations (Zn2+) have been introduced in the 
host NiMoO4. The Zn dopant concentration has been varied in the electrode, Ni1-xZnxMoO4, 
where x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 and 0.6. As reported in previous studies, using dopant promoters at an 
appropriate level, also tailors the structural property along with tuning the chemical 
environment and exposing more sites on the surface.25, 26 It is evident that the use of dopants 
with ionic radii and electronegativity comparable to those Ni2+ promotes the formation of a 
solid solution. Hence, Zn with an ionic radius of 0.074 nm vs. 0.069 nm for Ni2+ and 
electronegativity of 1.7 for Zn vs. 1.9 for Ni is indeed perfectly suited.27 Moreover, Zn has been 
chosen because of its non-toxicity and abundance in nature. Recently, the effect of 
manganese28, and iron29 doping on nickel molybdate nanorods has been demonstrated in the 
literature. However, till date, there are not many reports on employing Zn dopants for 
improving the electrochemical activity by modifying the active NiMoO4 sites at the atomic 
level. Herein, we have attempted to study the electrochemical properties of pristine and Zndoped NiMoO4 materials for energy storage and ethanol oxidation applications. Theoretical 
insights from defect formation, electronic and charge transfer calculations were employed to 
assess the underlying mechanism and salient features of the dopant promoters. The current 
work elucidates the effect of Zn dopants on 1D metal molybdates to enable enhanced 
electrochemical and electrocatalytic reactions."

textile industry has become a serious issue for environment safety and human health. Textile

. In general, the photocatalysis activity is
depends on the photogenerated of charge carriers and efficient charge transfer. The 
photocatalyst efficiency is determined by the recombination rate of the charge carriers. The 
recombination rate in a photocatalyst is generally much faster (nanoseconds) than the interfacial transfer rate (microseconds to milliseconds) where many charge carriers 
recombine and releasing the resulting energy as heat, thereby limiting the overall quantum 
efficiency of the photocatalyst [4]. To avoiding or controlling the unwanted recombination of 
charge carriers, the photocatalytic activity of semiconductor metal oxides can be significantly 
improved by tuning electronic properties. More importantly, the catalytic activity of 
nanostructures strongly depends on their surface structure. It can be reducing the

integration of electronic devices with energy harvesting systems
and micropower storage components1,2 has become mainstream research with widespread applications in electronic
skin,3,4 sensors,5,6 electronic fabrics,1,7,8 and smart windows.9,10
Electrochemical transistors are considered as a promising
option to realize transistors integrated with micropower storage
elements.11,12 They primarily utilize electric double-layer
(EDL) gating13−15 in realizing high interface capacitance up
to 500 μF/cm2 16 in diverse applications, such as efficient
biosensors,17,18 neuromorphic,11,19,20 and low-cost memory
devices.21,22 Highly charged EDL interfaces are realized using
ZnO as an active material and various ionic liquids, such as
N,N-diethyl-N-(2-methoxyethyl)-N-methylammonium bis-
(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (DEME-TFSI) by Yuan et
al.,13 imidazolium-based ionic liquids by Thiemann et al.,23

and sol−gel-processed silica electrolyte by Shao et al.,24 with
interface capacitances as high as 80 μF/cm2 at 0.1 Hz, 8.7 μF/
cm2 at 20 Hz, and 7.7 μF/cm2 and 3.0 μF/cm2 are measured at
1.0 Hz, respectively. It is also proven as a desirable technology
in field-effect devices with high gain and field mobility
approaching their bulk limits in polycrystalline transparent
conducting oxides (TCOs).25,26 Beyond these EDL-based
capacitive storage devices, a high density of interface oxide
charge has been realized in mobile vacancy/ion-rich insulators
in resistive switching devices,27−29 where a battery-controlled
charge storage (Faradaic-type) mechanism is revealed in solid
electrolyte-based two-terminal resistive switching devices.30,31
The charge storage mechanism in supercapacitor-based and
battery-type electrochemical storage devices has been a subject
of intense research,32,33 where supercapacitors are categorized
as electrochemical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) and
pseudocapacitors owing to their difference in the storage
mechanism. EDLCs utilize reversible adsorption of ions of the
liquid/solid electrolyte onto electrochemically stable electrode
materials that have a high specific surface area.34 The doublelayer capacitance is given 
where εr is the relative permittivity of the electrolyte, ε0 is the
dielectric constant of free space, d is the effective thickness of
the double layer (charge separation distance), and A is the
electrode surface area. In a typical EDLC, the separation d is of
the order of the radius of the solvated ions.35,36 Pseudocapacitance, on the other hand, is given a C q = V
d
d PC ion
ion
(2)
where qion is the amount of ionic charge required to form a
monolayer and dθion/dV is the fractional ionic coverage, which
generally takes values from 0 to 1.37 Two of the most common
types of pseudocapacitance are redox and intercalation
pseudocapacitances.37,38 Redox reaction involves reversible
electrochemical adsorption of ions on/near a surface and the
concomitant electron transfer at redox active sites, whereas
intercalation pseudocapacitance is based on a bulk phenomenon where intercalation of electroactive species occurs in layered
electrode material without any crystallographic phase
change.37,39
Despite the fact that there are multiple charge storage
mechanisms possible at the metal/insulating oxide/semiconductor layers, majority of the TCO-based liquid/solid
electrolyte devices, reported to date, have been identified as
electric double-layer field-effect transistors (FETs).21,25,40,41 We
have recently demonstrated a solid electrolyte-based threeterminal zinc oxide synaptic device featuring a gate polarityinduced drift motion and accumulation of mobile vacancies in
Ta2O5 gate insulator, with an effective modulation of channel
conductance depending on the density of accumulated positive
charge at the channel interface.42 The present study elucidates a
diffusion-controlled charge storage mechanism employing
oxygen ions/vacancies in the high-k gate insulator using cyclic
voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry and presents new
opportunities for realizing high-performance thin-film display
and synaptic memory devices with a distinctly different charge
storage mechanism from conventional EDL-based thin-film
devices. The electrochemical charge storage mechanism in the
gate insulator/semiconductor layers presents a pronounced
enhancement in the induced carrier density in the semiconducting channel that leads to superior transconductance and
memory retention."
96_intro.txt.txt,"The need for materials with a higher capacity and energy
storage for various applications including hybrid electric
vehicles and renewable energy sources is an ongoing issue in
materials and energy science. Some major advantages of βMnO2 as an electrode material and catalyst are its easy
preparation, low cost and low toxicity.1 This is especially true
when compared to conventional Co-containing battery
materials like LiCoO2
2 or Pt-based catalysts for oxygen
reduction reactions (ORRs).3 The search for safer, cheaper
and more efficient energy storage materials has resulted in
considerable research of manganese oxides.4−7
One of the most important and active research fields for βMnO2 is its application in Li-ion batteries. Early studies into
bulk β-MnO2 showed no significant Li-ion intercalation6,8,9 as a
possible result of the narrow tunnels present in the rutile
structure.10 However, recent work has shown that nanocomposite and mesoporous β-MnO2 samples show good Li-ion
intercalation,2,11,12 high capacities6,11,13 of up to 320 mAh g−1
and good cycling stability.6,14 Furthermore, ac impedance
measurements have demonstrated increased Li diffusion in
nanosized materials.14,15 Despite the clear need for an
understanding of why nanostructuring drastically improves
many of the electrochemical properties of this material, it is
only very recently that the interfaces of this material have been
analyzed in any great detail. So far, the focus has been on
surfaces and their impact on electrochemical properties.2,14 In
this work, we use computational techniques to produce the first
assessment of grain boundaries in this material and assess their
potential influence on its electrochemical properties.
In addition to its use as an electrode material, MnO2 is also
well-known for its performance in numerous catalytic
processes. Recent efforts have focused on its use in electrochemical ORRs, which are essential in a variety of energy
storage and conversion applications including metal−air
batteries and fuel cells.2,7,16 A prime example of this technology
is the Li−O2 battery, which is an alternative to conventional Liion batteries and could potentially significantly increase specific
energy density.2,17 However, it has been shown that these
batteries are susceptible to overpotentials and rate limitations.2,18 Fortunately, studies have suggested that the use of
transition metals nanowires including rutile MnO2 reduces
overpotentials as well as improves cycling stability.19−21
Although some studies have questioned the usefulness of
such catalysts as a result of electrolyte decomposition,22,23 it is
clear that a good understanding of the role these materials have
on ORRs is essential. Tompsett et al.2 provide a good overview
of the other catalytic applications of manganese oxides, which
range from the oxidation of Cr3+ to Cr4+24,25 to reduction of
NOx.
26
One other important major application of β-MnO2 is as a
supercapacitor. As with Li-ion batteries, bulk β-MnO2 show limited applications for supercapacitors27 with a capacitance of
around only 9 F g−1
. However, again, nanostructuring of βMnO2 has been proven to significantly improve the electrochemical performance of the material. Nanostructuring of the
material has been shown28 to increase the capacitance to 294 F
g−1
. In recent years, graphene and nanostructured MnO2
composites have become a powerful combination in the search
for low cost energy storage and conversion systems with high
performance.29−31 It is thought that the cause of this dramatic
increase in capacitance is a result of the greater surface area
exposure as a result of the nanostructuring.2
The impact of interfaces on such electrochemical processes is
still not well-known and this is even more so for grain
boundaries. It is also not clear what the concentration of grain
boundaries is in these nanostructured β-MnO2 samples.
Although grain boundaries will play a more significant role in
determining the properties of bulk samples, the grain boundary
concentration in the more electrochemically active nanostructured samples will be significantly reduced. However,
grain boundaries adjacent to the highly active surfaces in these
samples are likely to be important in influencing the
electrochemical properties. Given the importance of oxygen
vacancy formation in these processes, it is essential that a study
with the focus on grain boundaries is completed to complement
previous surface and bulk studies.
Considering the amount of research focused on β-MnO2 and
its simple bulk structure, it could be expected that there is a
good understanding of and considerable data available on the
grain boundary structures of this material; unfortunately, this is
not the case. This is true for both experimental and simulation
studies. Works by Sayle et al.13,32 and Maphanga et al.33 focus
on molecular dynamics simulations of the prediction of
electrochemical properties for a variety of MnO2 nanoparticles
as well as amorphization and recrystallization of Li-ion insertion
into MnO2. Even in these studies, grain boundaries are only
treated indirectly and are a result of the recrystallization
process. Although data for rutile MnO2 grain boundaries is very
limited, there is both a wealth of computational34−36 and
experimental37−39 information for rutile TiO2. Although
structural comparison with TiO2 is far from ideal, the two
materials have the same rutile structure, meaning it can still be a
helpful tool for checking the validity of the calculated MnO2
grain boundary structures.
Other than those mentioned previously, all computational
studies of rutile MnO2 have focused on the bulk and surface
structures. Franchini et al.40 used density functional theory
(DFT) and hybrid DFT calculations to assess the structural,
electronic, magnetic and thermodynamical properties of
multiple bulk manganese oxides polymorphs. The relative
strengths and weaknesses of each computational approach in
calculating said properties were reported. One recent study1
focuses on the lithiation of bulk β-MnO2 using DFT and cluster
expansion calculations. Electrochemical potentials of 3.47 to
2.77 eV are calculated for the lithiation process and Jahn−
Teller distortion occurs as a result of mixed Mn valence states.
This distortion is found to be responsible for asymmetric
deformation during charge−discharge, which results in the
irreversible capacity fading during cycling. DFT+U has also
been used to study the phase stability of K-doped β-MnO2.
41
The simulation of β-MnO2 surfaces has received considerable
attention in recent times. The majority of these works used ab
initio methods; however, one exception is the work of
Maphanga et al.42 where interatomic potentials are used to
study low index surfaces of β-MnO2. Two studies by Oxford
and Chaka43,44 use the generalized gradient approximation
(GGA) to also study low index surfaces. The surface energies of
stoichiometric as well as heavily oxidized and reduced surfaces
are calculated. Surface hydration is also considered. The effect
of oxygen vacancies and hydrogen on the (110) surface of βMnO2 has also been assessed in a joint experimental−
computational study.7 This work shows how the catalytic
activity of β-MnO2 can be enhanced with only the introduction
of oxygen deficiency. One weakness of the standard GGA is the
poor reproduction of the electronic structure;40 this has led
authors to apply on-site Coulombic interactions in the form of
the DFT+U calculations. Mellan et al.45 used this approach for
calculating lithium and oxygen adsorption at the (110) surface
of β-MnO2. Tompsett et al.2,14 also used GGA+U to consider
the importance of surface to bulk Li-ion migration as well as the
structure of numerous β-MnO2 surfaces and the effect oxygen
vacancy formation has on the catalytic properties of these
surfaces. They found that the formation energies of oxygen
vacancies and Mn reduction were low compared to the bulk
and other rutile structures which suggested high electrochemical performance of β-MnO2 surfaces.
In this work, we use interatomic potential methods to
analyze the stabilities and structures of a variety of tilt
boundaries in β-MnO2. We also predict the potential catalytic
activity of these grain boundaries by calculating oxygen vacancy
and reduction energies and comparing the results to values
obtained for the bulk. We begin by describing the computational methods and our justification for using such methods.
This is followed by details of the grain boundary construction
and a discussion of their stabilities and structures. Finally, we
discuss the calculated energies of oxygen vacancy formation and
Mn4+ reduction and the consequences for catalytic activity"

98_intro.txt.txt,"With the rapid development of renewable energy technologies,
electrical vehicles, and portable and wearable electronics, there
is an ever-increasing demand for high performance energy
storage devices with high energy/power density, long cycle life,
low cost and light weight.1,2 Although lithium-ion batteries with
high energy density are the most widely used product in our
daily life, they still suffer from low power density, inferior cycle
life, battery explosion issues and high cost.3,4 Supercapacitors
(SCs) with high power density, long cycle life, and fast charge–
discharge capability have been actively investigated for nextgeneration safe, low-cost, clean energy storage systems.5,6
Nevertheless, the low energy density of supercapacitors has
signicantly hindered their practical application, which can be
effectively improved by increasing the specic capacitance (C)
and/or maximizing the cell operating voltage (V) according to
the energy density equation E ¼ 1
2CV2
.
7 Constructing asymmetric
SCs by taking advantage of the different potential windows of
positive and negative electrodes has arisen to be an effective
strategy for increasing the operating window, thus increasing
the energy density.7–9 Therefore, considerable research efforts
have been focused on fabricating highly capacitive positive and
negative electrodes.
Among the various electrode materials for SCs,5,8,10 such as
RuO2, MnOx, MoO3, VOx, NiO, CoOx, Ni(OH)2, Co(OH)2, and
conducting polymers, MnO2 has been regarded as the most
promising pseudocapacitive material owing to its large theoretical specic capacitance (1300 F g1
), low cost, environmental friendliness, and natural abundance.11–14 However,
similar to other metal oxides, the practical application of MnO2
has been severely limited by its low electrical conductivity and
poor long-term cyclic stability. Combining highly conductive carbon-based materials (e.g., carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and
graphene) with MnO2 has been proven to signicantly enhance
its electrochemical performance due to the synergistic effect of
the high conductivity of carbon-based materials and the high
pseudocapacitance of MnO2.
8,15–21 However, the interface resistance between the MnO2 and the carbon materials will lead to
a signicant capacity decay and inferior cyclic stability when
operated at a high charge/discharge rate.20–23 Thus, there is still
a need to improve the intrinsic electrical conductivity of MnO2
to further improve the electrochemical performance. Recently,
it has been demonstrated that introducing oxygen vacancies
into MnO2 can signicantly improve the conductivity, as well as
accelerate the kinetics of the redox reactions, thus enhancing its
electrochemical performance.24–26 For example, Tong et al.25
reported an oxygen-decient MnO2x prepared by a hydrogenation treatment that showed a dramatically improved conductivity as well as enhanced electrochemical performance.
Furthermore, previous studies have demonstrated that nitrogen
doping of metal oxides can not only increase their electrical
conductivity, but also dramatically improve their electrochemical stability, thereby enhancing their electrochemical
performance when they are used as electrode materials.27,28 For
instance, Wang et al.28 reported that nitrogen-doped MoO3 can
be obtained by ammonolysis of MoO3, which showed a better
conductivity, stability, and electrochemical performance
compared to original MoO3. Nevertheless, high-temperature
treatment (i.e., typically more than 280 C) is indispensable
for introducing oxygen vacancies and nitrogen doping in
existing works; thus, there is still a need to develop an effective
approach to introduce oxygen vacancies and nitrogen doping to
metal oxides at a moderate temperature that can dramatically
improve their conductivity, stability, and electrochemical
performance.
Mass loading per area is an important parameter for SCs for
practical applications.29 Most reported MnO2-based electrodes
with high capacitance and excellent cyclic stability generally
have a small mass loading of active materials (e.g., <1 mg cm2
),
and the electrochemical performance decreased dramatically
with increased mass loading.13,30,31 Therefore, it is still very
challenging to develop high performance MnO2-based electrodes with high capacitance, good rate performance, and
improved cyclic stability at a high mass loading of active
materials, as well as excellent exibility. It has been demonstrated that designing a three-dimensional (3D) architectural
structure for electrodes could lead to a high surface area and
fast charge transfer kinetics, thus permitting high mass loading
of active materials.8,29,32,33
On the basis of the above considerations, we rst designed
and fabricated a 3D MnO2 nanowire–graphene oxide (GO)–
cellulose nanobril (CNF) hybrid aerogel via an environmentally friendly ice-template freeze-drying process.34–36 CNFs
derived from cellulose have high aspect ratios, excellent exibility, and superior hydrophilicity,37 and can be easily integrated
with GO and MnO2 to achieve 3D, highly porous, freestanding,
binder-free, high-performance exible electrodes. Owing to the
highly porous 3D network structure, the aggregation of graphene nanosheets was effectively prevented during subsequent
hydrazine vapor reduction.35 Simultaneously, introducing
oxygen vacancies and nitrogen doping to the MnO2 nanowires
resulted in a free-standing, highly porous, highly exible
manganese oxynitride (MnOxNy)–reduced graphene oxide
(RGO)–CNF aerogel electrode. This electrode exhibited a high
capacitance (455.8 F g1 at a current density of 1.08 A g1
) and
an excellent rate capability (319.2 F g1 at a current density of
16.2 A g1
) at a high active materials mass loading of 6.02 mg
cm2
. Moreover, this effective approach can also be applied to
negative electrode design. Molybdenum oxynitride (MoOxNy)–
RGO–CNF was successfully fabricated and exhibited excellent
electrochemical performance as a negative electrode for SCs.
Furthermore, high-performance 1.8 V ASCs using the MnOxNy/
RGO/CNF aerogel as the positive electrode and the MoOxNy/
RGO/CNF aerogel as the negative electrode were successfully
demonstrated. They delivered high specic capacitances,
excellent long-term cycling stabilities, and high energy and
power densities."
99_intro.txt.txt,"The application demand is significantly increasing for new
energy storage devices, such as lithium-ion batteries [1,2], metal
air batteries [3,4], sodium ion batteries [5], zinc ion batteries
(ZIB) [6] and supercapacitors (SCs) [7,8], with the development of
the society and growth of the human demand. Among these
devices, SCs and ZIB have an excellent application potential in
transportation, industrial electronics, power grid energy storage,
wireless communication and other fields due to their numerous
advantages such as the safe operation, long cycle life, and fast
charging as well as discharging rates [7–9]. In particular, as an
important part of SCs, the pseudocapacitor exhibits superior specific capacitance and energy density as high as batteries since the
charge storage mechanism is closely associated with the fast reversible multi-electron surface faradaic redox reactions [10–13]. However, a key challenge for pseudocapacitors and ZIB is how to choose
appropriate cathode electrode active materials, which significantly
affects their electrochemical performance [14–16]. Therefore, the
reasonable design and optimization of cathode electrode active
materials play a significant role in improving the performance of
new energy storage devices [16–19].
Nickel cobalt based metal oxides (NiCo2O4, CoNiO2), as one of
the ideal candidate electrode materials for pseudocapacitors and
ZIB, have drawn extensive research interests due to their high theoretical specific capacitance, multiple redox reactions and abundant electronic structures [20–22]. However, the actual specific
pseudo capacitance is much lower than the theoretical pseudo capacitance because of their low conductivity [23]. In order to further improving the pseudo capacitance of nickel cobalt-based
metal oxides, the oxygen vacancy, as a key defect and improvement strategy, can regulate the crystal and electronic structures
of nickel cobalt-based oxides, which greatly increase the carrier
density, accelerate the electron transfer, promote the electrical
conductivity, and improve the electrochemical performance [24–
27]. There are quite a few effective methods developed to introduce oxygen vacancies into nickel cobalt-based oxides, such as
high temperature reduction (H2, Mg, Al) [28], plasma and laser
treatment, which are accompanied by the formation of surface
hydroxyl groups, active defects and hydrogen impurities [29].
Among these above strategies, low temperature heat treatment
in inert atmosphere can make the samples produce more stable
oxygen vacancies without the influence of impurity [26,30]. Sun
et al. [24] reported NiCo2O4 electrodes with oxygen vacancies
annealed in different volume ratios of N2 and O2 condition, and
they found that NCO-9 (VN2:VO2 = 9:1) delivered superior specific
capacitance and rate capability. In addition, the introduction of
oxygen vacancy makes it a positive charge, which can increase
the adsorption intensity for –OH. The newly introduced oxygen
vacancy can also enhance redox reaction kinetics and strengthen
the redox reactivity of nickel cobalt-based metal oxides since oxygen vacancies serve as an effective approach to increase the electrochemical reactivity of active sites and to modify
electrochemical performance [30,31]. Zou et al. [32] found that
the introduction of oxygen vacancies can increase the ratio of
active sites, compensate the internal nonzero dipole moment,
and adjust electron distribution as well as orbital variation, thus
stabilizing the wurtzite structure of MnO hexagonal nanosheets
during lithiation/delithiation processes. However, the mechanism
of electrochemical energy storage affected via the oxygen vacancy
is not systematically investigated via the experiment and the density functional theory (DFT) calculation. Therefore, it is of vital significance to synthesize nickel cobalt-based metal oxides with
abundant oxygen vacancies and understand the mechanism of
the enhanced energy storage both pseudocapacitors and aqueous
ZIB.
Herein, we develop a facile approach for oxygen vacancies
enriched nickel cobalt based oxides nanoflower arrays assembled
by 1D nanowires in situ grown on the Ni foam (NF) via the
hydrothermal process followed annealing process in air and argon
atmospheres respectively (Fig. 1). The improved strategy involves
oxygen vacancies to tailor the crystal and electronic microstructures of the resulting NiCo2O4 (NCO-Air) and CoNiO2 (NCO-Ar)
products. Compared with NCO-Air, NCO-Ar nanoflower arrays have
larger specific surface area and much more oxygen vacancies,
which shows superior areal capacitance of 6.39 F/cm2 at current
density of 1 mA/cm2 or specific capacitance of 1172.64 F/g at
1 A/g and long-term cycle stability of 113% at current density of
30 mA/cm2
. Furthermore, the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor of CoNiO2//active carbon (AC) delivers an excellent energy density of 112.52 Wh/kg at a power density of 558.73 W/kg, and high
specific capacity of 180.20 mAh/g and energy density of
308.14 Wh/kg when it is further assembled into aqueous ZIB of
NCO-Ar//Zn. Both experimental characterization and theoretical
calculation reveal that the oxygen vacancy can improve the performance of new energy storage electrode materials and devices.
2. Experimental
All the reagents used in the experiments are analytical grade
without further purification. Prior to the procedure, the well-cut
NF (1  1.5 cm2
) was carefully cleaned by the sonication in ethanol
and deionized water for 30 min, and then dried and wrapped with
polytetrafluoroethylene tape except the area of 1  1 cm2
. NCO
electrode was prepared via facile hydrothermal routes followed
the annealing treatment as shown in Fig. 1. 4 mmol of Co(NO3)2-
6H2O, 2 mmol of Ni(NO3)26H2O, 12 mmol of urea and 0.04 g of
polyvinylpyrrolidone were mixed with 30 mL deionized water to
form a homogeneous solution by ultrasonic treatment for
30 min. The above solution was then transferred to a 50 ml
teflon-lined stainless autoclave and the treated NF (silvery, as
shown in Fig. 1) was suspended vertically in the middle of the reactor. After hydrothermal reaction at 120℃ for 8 h, it can be observed
that Ni-Co precursors (blue, as shown in Fig. 1) are uniformly and
densely grown on the NF. Then rinsed the surface of the NF repeatedly and gently using deionized water and vacuum dried at 60 ℃.
Ni-Co precursors were calcined at 350℃ for 2 h in a tube furnace
filled with air and Ar atmosphere respectively, and finally marked
as NCO-Air and NCO-Ar, and their mass loadings were about 14
and 15 mg/cm2 respectively. It is also observed that the color of
Ni-Co precursors was changed from blue to black (black, as shown
in Fig. 1). The detailed experiment information including the
assembly of asymmetric supercapacitors (ASC) and aqueous ZIB,
related structural characterizations, electrochemical measurements and computational details are shown in the supporting
information."
100_intro.txt.txt,"Recently, aqueous supercapacitors have attracted great concerns,
which is ascribed to their advantages, such as environmental friendliness, fast charge and discharge rates, long cycle life and high power
density (103
-104 kW kg−1
) [1–6]. However, the low energy density
limits its practical applications (< 10 Wh kg−1
) [7,8]. From the formula of E = 1/2CV2
, it can be seen that the energy density (E) of supercapacitor is determined by the voltage window (V) and capacitance
(C), which indicated that there are two possible solutions to effectively
increase the energy density: one is to improve the electrode voltage
window and the other is to enhance the specific capacity of electrodes
[9]. Many pseudocapacitive materials were often used as electrode
because they may provide a high specific capacitance for the supercapacitors, such as Co3O4 [10–13], NiO [14,15], MoO2 [16]. Among
numerous materials, MnO2 attracts much attention due to high theoretical specific capacitance (1370F g−1
), wide voltage window, low
cost, environmentally friendly and rich natural reserves [5,17–20].However, the low conductivity (10−5
–10−6 S cm−1
) significantly
blocks the enhancement of capacitance of MnO2 electrode materials
[21]. Therefore, it is urgent to enhance the capacitance of MnO2 by
improving the conductivity.
MnO2 composite electrodes, such as MnO2/carbon [22–26], MnO2/
Transition Metal Oxides (TMOs) [27–29], and MnO2/polymer composites[30–33] have been reported to increase the conductivity and enhance the overall properties of the MnO2-based electrode. Even though
these studies have shown that the conductivity and electrochemical
performance of MnO2 electrode have been improved, the experimental
capacitance is far from the theoretical specific capacitance due to the
low conductivity of MnO2 [34,35]. This is attributed to the low conductivity, which makes the charge transfer slower when an electrochemical redox reaction of the MnO2 electrode material occurs. Other
methods for optimizing conductivity and enhancing electrochemical
capacitance should also be found. It is reported that mixed valence
(Mn3+, Mn4+) may be beneficial to increase conductivity of MnO2, due
to fast charge transfer during charging and discharging process
[34,36,37]. In recent years, regulation ratio of the Mn3+/Mn4+ has
been explored to increase conductivity of MnO2. The ratio of Mn3+/
Mn4+ may be controlled via pre-intercalating cation (Li+, Na+, K+
etc.) in MnO2 [36,38,39], or by equilibrating the oxide in PH-controlled
suspensions [40]. Here, we used an electrodeposition method to prepare MnO2 electrodes with adjustable Mn3+/Mn4+ ratio, which had
enhanced electrochemical performance.
Herein, we performed a systematic investigation on the electrodeposition temperature and the Mn3+/Mn4+ ratio of nanostructured
MnO2/carbon cloth electrode materials. The MnO2/CC electrode materials with Mn3+/Mn4+ ratio of about 0.99 prepared at 70 °C possess a
slightly high specific capacitance of 408.1 F g−1 at 1 A g−1
, and a
99.4% of the original specific capacitance after 2000 cycles. It turns out
that the presence of certain amount of Mn3+ ions in the MnO2 electrode
materials can improve electrochemical performance [37]. And a flexible ASC were assembled, which is MnO2/CC as the positive electrode,
FeOOH/C nanospheres as the negative electrode and LiCl/PVA as
electrolytes, respectively. What’s more, the ASC exhibits a high energy
density of 55.9 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 1240 W kg−1
, and can
even remain 19.1 Wh kg−1 at a high power density of 6870 W kg−1"
101_intro.txt.txt,"High-performance energy storage setups have become the everincreasing practical demands for the next-generation consumer electronics, hybrid electric vehicles and large-scale deployment. As an 
emerging energy storage devices, electrochemical supercapacitors have 
attracted tremendous focus due to the merits of fast charge-discharge 
rate (within seconds), long cycling life (more than thousands of cycles) and high power density (several kilowatts per kilogram) when 
compared to the traditional batteries [1–5]. However, the achieved 
electrochemical performance of supercapacitor was still far below the 
theoretical results, which greatly hinder their practical applications. 
Since the internal electronic structure and composition of electrode 
materials can determine the reaction rate and transfer process, enormous effects have been devoted to improving the electrochemical 
properties of electrode materials, including nanostructure designing, 
electronic modification and multi-component incorporation [6–10]. Of 
particular, defect engineering was considered to be an effective strategy 
to modify the surface and electronic properties of electrode materials, 
which has been widely used in the previous reports [11,12]. 
In principle, the presence of defects will disturb the surrounding 
atoms to some extent and cause lattice distortion in the crystal materials, 
and the defecting engineering strategies can be adopted to regulate the 
electronic structure and chemical properties or electrical conductivity of 
the materials effectively, so as to further optimize the electrochemical 
properties of the materials. Take one of the most representative electrode material MnO2 as the example, Zhai et al. claimed that the MnO2 
nanorods with oxygen vacancies benefits for greatly improved conductivity of MnO2, which leads to a significant electrochemical capacitive 
performance of MnO2-based electrode [13]. Chen and co-workers synthesized Zn2+ doping MnO2 to generate oxygen-deficient MnO2, 
improving the reactivity of the electrode material significantly [14]. It is evident that the presence of oxygen vacancies in the MnO2 electrode 
material can well modify the electronic properties and electrochemical 
activity of intrinsic MnO2, which makes a great help for the electrochemical performance enhancement for its based electrode. However, 
the common oxygen vacancies are easily consumed or vanished during 
the cycled electrochemical reactions, which is mainly attributed to the 
typical electrochemical cycling effect, in which the MnO2 material occurs dissolution and deposition due to the redox (Mn3+/4+) and 
disproportion (Mn3+ → Mn4+ + Mn2+) reactions in the aqueous solution. Therefore, revealing the structure-property relationship or mechanism between the defects and electrochemical properties, and then 
achieving rational defect design/engineering of electrode materials with 
robust oxygen vacancies becomes the vital issue to achieve an overall 
improved electrochemical performance for the advanced energy storage 
applications. 
In the typical model of birnessite-MnO2 electrode material, it is 
composed of layers of edge-sharing [MnO6] polymorphs with an interlayer configuration. In general, there are randomly distributed water 
molecules and metal cations (such as K+, Na+, and Ca2+) during the 
electrochemical energy storing process, in which some of the Mn cations 
are reduced from Mn(IV) to Mn(III) or oxidated from Mn(III) to Mn(IV). 
It is predicted that the coexistence of Mn(IV) and Mn(III) at the interlayered sites is critical for its electrochemical activity due to the highspin nature of Mn(III) (with e1
g electronic configuration) according to 
the DFT calculations. Note that the “balanced equilibrium” in the 
interlayer regime can be kept perfectly under the condition of Mn(IV) to 
Mn(III) co-existing, which surpasses the formation of dissolved Mn(II). 
In contrast, another type of oxygen defects in the surface shows the 
lower electrochemical activity due to the ion intercalation characteristics of birnessite-MnO2 during the electrochemical charge-discharge 
process. What is more important is that the surface defects can be 
easily consumed and vanished due to the second law of thermo-dynamics during cycled electrochemical reactions, which will lead to the 
significant capacitance degradation phenomenon. Yan’s work 
mentioned the lattice oxygen structure has a great influence on the 
reactivity of manganese oxide, which is the key to improving the electrochemical performance [15,16]. However, as supercapacitors electrode materials, 10,000 charge/discharge cycles will also cause the 
consumption of lattice oxygen vacancies, which will eventually lead to 
the degradation of the electrochemical properties. Thus, regulating a 
defect engineering recipe becomes a vital and direct route to advance 
the performance of the electrode materials. 
Herein, we develop a versatile oxygen vacancies defect engineering 
recipe combining the mild H-plasma and O-plasma with a demonstration of the prototypical birnessite-MnO2. In experiments, the birnessiteMnO2 with robust lattice oxygen vacancies (LOV-MnO2) was obtained 
by the H-plasma and O-plasma treatment successively, in which the 
aggressive H-plasma generates the oxygen vacancies throughout the 
MnO2 mildly and the following O-plasma treatment leads to the healing 
of surface oxygen defects with the residual lattice oxygen vacancies. The 
resultant LOV-MnO2 shows the enhanced conductivity and electrochemical active sites, which is further demonstrated by the DFT calculation results with a lowered ion diffusion energy barrier in the 
interlayer regime. The electrochemical characterizations demonstrate a 
significantly enhanced capacitance of LOV-MnO2 with the highest specific capacitance of 445.1 F g− 1
. More impressively, the LOV-MnO2- 
based electrode exhibits superior capacitance retention of 96.6% after 
10000-cycles charge-discharge operations. The configured symmetric 
supercapacitor device (LOV-MnO2//LOV-MnO2) delivers a high energy 
density and power density of 92.3 Wh kg− 1 and 1100.3 W kg− 1
, 
respectively, with a voltage window of 2.2 V. Our results suggest the 
defect engineering recipes proposed here could greatly inspire the 
formulation of the design principle for the advanced electrode materials 
for high-performance electrochemical energy storage devices. "
102_intro.txt.txt,"For the past few years, the rapidly growing issue of energy-related and environmental prompt 
the demands for clean and sustainable energy more and more urgent, so as to relieve the 
environmental and energy-related pressure caused by the utilization of traditional energy. In this 
regard, energy conversion technologies, especially electrochemical energy application (e.g., 
rechargeable batteries, fuel cells and supercapacitors), have developed rapidly and made 
satisfactory progress [1-3]. As one of the typical devices of electrochemical energy conversion, 
supercapacitors has been applied in a wide range of industries including the power sector, 
industry, electronics and electrified transportation [4]. These practical applications are inseparable 
from the outstanding characteristics of supercapacitors, especially the peculiarities of large power 
density, durable service life and low price, which are mainly determined by the physical energy 
storage mechanism [5-6]. Unfortunately, the low energy density of supercapacitors, especially the 
traditional carbon-based electrical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs), is difficult to meet the 
requirements of the rapidly developing industry. As one of the new functional materials emerging 
in recent years, pseudocapacitive materials offer both high energy density and power density 
simultaneously, exhibit battery-like charge storage mechanism but with a charge storage velocity 
comparable to EDLCs materials, which filled the gap between EDLCs and the batteries [7-10].
As a kind of material that usually expressed as [M2+
1-xM3+
x(OH)2]An-x/n·mH2O (M2+
represents bivalent metal cations, M3+ presents trivalent metal cations and An- represents an 
interlayer anion, respectively), layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have been adopted as active 
material for supercapacitors electrode thanks to its special structure and composition [11-13]. 
Eminently, LDHs containing trivalent aluminium (Al3+) have been reported to have stable 
structures and electrochemical properties, such as NiAl LDHs [14], CoAl LDHs [15] and MgAl 
LDHs [16]. Although LDHs have great potential characteristics of energy storage according to 
theoretical calculation, the actual performance is not up to expectations due to considerably poor 
electrical conductivity of LDHs-in-themselves [17-18]. So far, to composite with the materials that
conducts electricity well such as graphene [19], carbon materials [20], conductive polymer [21], 
etc., and derive into oxides [22], sulfides [23] and phosphates [24], and change the electronic 
structure of the bulk materials [25] are familiar strategies to solve this conundrum. Numerous research shows that vacancy or defect has an effective effect on the output 
characteristics of electrode materials, such as boosting the quantity of redox or adsorption 
effective sites, accelerating the transmission of the electron and improving the intrinsic 
conductivity of the materials [26-28]. For instance, Zou’s group modulated the oxygen vacancies 
of NiMn LDHs with mild H2O2, which presented a supreme specific capacitance of 1183 C g−1
under the current density of 1 A g−1 [29]. Liang et al. synthesized the oxygen-vacancy-rich NiCo 
LDH nanowire array by reduced the pristine LDHs using NaBH4, and the obtained Vo-NiCo LDH 
showed 1.57 times of specific capacitance compared to pristine LDHs [30]. Furthermore, 
compared with hydrogen atmosphere reduction, anoxic calcining and acid etching, the wet 
chemical reduction is a simple vacancy generation method, which can increase the content of 
oxygen vacancy without destroying the structure of materials subversively [30-31].
Based on the aforementioned discussion, in this work, the oxygen vacancies in CoAl LDHs 
were further increased under the reduction of NaBH4. Thanks to the abundant oxygen vacancies 
and slight structural change, the obtained CoAl LDHs-0.5 presents maximum specific capacity of 
799.2 F g-1 under a current density of 1 A g-1 (approximate 1.4 times to original CoAl LDHs) with 
a capacity retention of 81.1 % as the promotion of current densities to 20 A g-1. The outstanding 
expression of electrochemical is benefited by the promotion of electron and ion transfer by 
vacancies. Furthermore, the asymmetric supercapacitor packaged by CoAl LDHs-0.5 and 
commercial activated carbon delivers an energy density of 28.9 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 
523.5 W kg-1 and retains 73.3 % of the initial capacity after 5000 consecutive cycles under a 
current density of 5 A g-1

103_intro.txt.txt,"The demands of developing environmentally benign energy
storage systems are getting more intense due to the increasing
environmental pollution and global energy crisis issue [1]. With the
combined merits of high power density, fast charge-discharge
rates, and long cycling lifetime, the supercapacitor is recognized
as an emerging next-generation energy storage device [2e5].
However, compared with the rechargeable battery, the rather
moderate energy density has limited its practical application [6e8].
Thus, recent cutting-edge research has been directed to increasing
the energy density without compromising their specific characteristics, namely fast energy storage rate and longevity. Different
from the electrical double-layer capacitors that store charges via
ion adsorptions, pseudocapacitors are able to deliver an energy
density as high as that of batteries through the fast reversible multielectron surface Faradaic redox reactions [9e13]. Among factors
determining the final devices performance, the pseudocapacitive
material plays a central role [14e16]. Therefore, tremendous endeavors have been devoted to developing various pseudocapacitive
materials to get a well balance between the aforementioned specific characteristics of supercapacitors.
Particularly, ternary nickel cobaltite (NiCo2O4) has received
enormous concerns in virtue of its better electrical conductivity and
richer redox reactions than binary nickel oxide and cobalt oxide
[17e21]. Meanwhile, constructing hybrid nanostructures with
highly conductive carbon materials is an effective way to further
promote the electron transport and increase the active surface area,
thus leading to improved capacitance and rate capability [22e29].
For instance, Wu et al. fabricated a network of NiCo2O4@carbon
nanotubes composite [30], and the resultant hybrid materials
indeed deliver much better electrochemical performance than the
individual components. Nevertheless, it should be pointed out that
these carbon materials usually synthesized at much high temperatures, which would arouse serious damage to the structures of
NiCo2O4. As a result, the employed carbon materials, such as carbon
cloth, carbon nanotubes, and graphene, have to be prepared well firstly. However, this two-step strategy inevitably adds additional
cost. Even worse, the NiCo2O4 species are difficult to be anchored
on the as-obtained carbon matrix with an ideal dispersity because
of the weak interactions between each other. Therefore, it still remains a great challenge to simultaneously achieve conductive
carbon materials and well-dispersed NiCo2O4 species because of
the lack of facile and suitable synthetic strategy.
Benefiting from the abundant nitrogen coordinators with rich
electron lone pairs, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is considered
as a good platform for stabilizing metal atoms [31e33]. Inspired of
this, Zhang et al. directly synthesized nanostructured NiCo2O4 on gC3N4 and employed as electrodes for supercapacitors [34]. But, the
performance is far from expectation. This is because that the g-C3N4
itself acts only as the dispersant in these composites and the g-C3N4
is actually a semiconductor with poor conductivity [35,36]. It has
been reported that eliminating the nitrogen atoms from the planar
network of g-C3N4 can form graphitic sp2
-carbon structures,
thereby substantially enhancing the conductivity [37e40]. Nevertheless, literatures reported to date show that this transformation
process can only take place when the temperature is beyond
750 C. Therefore, this high temperature limitation still hampers
the synthesis of fine dispersion NiCo2O4 active species on desired
conductive carbon materials.
Herein, we develop a feasible synthetic strategy to realize the
one-step synthesis of oxygen-vacancy-rich NiCo2O4 onto nitrogendeficient g-C3N4 (Ov-NiCo2O4/ND-g-C3N4) via a heat treatment
under air at a relatively low temperature. The employed g-C3N4 not
only acts as a substrate to tightly anchor the NiCo2O4, but also induces the formation of oxygen-vacancy-rich NiCo2O4. Meanwhile,
the newly formed NiCo2O4 species unexpectedly promote the
denitriding process of g-C3N4 and catalyze the formation of
graphite-like sp2 carbon structure. Featuring interconnected
structures, abundant active sites and excellent electrical conductivity, the Ov-NiCo2O4/ND-g-C3N4 hybrid enables facile electron
transfer and rapid pseudocapacitive processes. As expected in
three-electrode system, the resultant Ov-NiCo2O4/ND-g-C3N4 delivers an encouraging capacitance of 1998 F g1 (277.5 mAh g1

104_intro.txt.txt,"Supercapacitors are a kind of energy storage device with fast charge and discharge 
rate, high power density and long service life [1, 2], which has extensive application in 
automotive, electric vehicles and railways [2-5]. Supercapacitor-electrode materials are 
known to be critical to the performance of charge storage. Different from carbon-based 
electrode materials, Metal oxides with unique electrochemical pseudocapacitive 
behavior can store charge through a redox transfer, which has been shown to improve 
capacitance [6, 7]. Recently, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been focused on 
many research fields among gas capture, catalysis and energy storage, due to the variety 
of highly ordered structures, high porosity, controllable pore size [4, 6, 8-10]. Moreover, 
MOFs have been widely explored to fabricate porous metal-based materials by 
pyrolysis, which have also been widely applied in energy conversion [6, 11].
Prussian blue analogues (PBA), as an important class of MOFs, have been drawn 
much attention due to its various compositions and morphologies with uniform size [3, 
12]. Many electrode materials with porous and hollow structures were obtained with a 
similar morphology of PBA utilizing PBA as a precursor, which own higher specific 
surface area and more open diffusion channels [13-15]. For example, Wang et al. 
reported that hollow Co PBA exhibited a superior specific capacitance of 292 F/g in the 
neutral Na2SO4 [15]. And Gao et al. reported that nanofeathers NiCo2O4 electrode 
derived from Ni-Co PBA displayed a superior specific capacitance of 1797 F/g at 1 A/g 
[16]. Some reports found the control of shape and size for PBA have a positive influence 
on the electrochemical properties of the electrode material [17]. And it is very attractive 
but still remains great challenges to design and develop PBA with the new structure to
fabricate porous electrode material.
In this work, we firstly prepared uniform-sized (Ce[Fe(CN)6]) Ce-Fe PBA with 
hexagonal bipyramidal microcrystals, and explored the growth of crystal and structural 
evolution of the Ce–Fe PBA. Such a preparation method provides a much feasible 
solution to reach a uniform size in the nanoscale or mesoscale regime. More importantly, 
porous Fe-CeO2 with rich oxygen vacancies (OVs) were obtained by annealing of Ce–
Fe PBA at 500oC. The porous Fe-CeO2 electrode exhibits superior specific capacitance 
and high energy densities and power densities for supercapacitors."
105_intro.txt.txt,"In today's world, as the severe environmental pollution and rapid depletion of 
non-renewable energy sources, it’s urgent to find alternative sustainable energy 
sources and develop new energy storage devices. As a new type of environmentally 
friendly energy storage device, supercapacitors (SCs) have entered the vision of 
public in recent years.1-5SCs combine the advantages of traditional capacitors and  batteries including relative large capacitance, high power density, extremely long 
service life and environmentally benign feature, which make them are a kind of 
chemical power supply with broad application prospects in the automotive industry, 
information technology, electronics industry and so on.6, 7 According to different 
energy storage mechanisms, SCs are mainly divided into electric double-layer 
capacitors (EDLCs), pseudocapacitors (PCs) and hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs).8-10
EDLCs use the interface electric double layer formed between the electrode and 
electrolyte to store energy.10 At present, extensive studies of EDLCs using carbon 
electrodes (grapheme,11 carbon nanotubes,12 etc.) with large specific surface area and 
good conductivity have been performed. In contrast, PCs mainly use transition metal 
oxides,13 metal hydroxides,14 metal sulfides,15-17 conducting polymers18 and their 
composites19-21 as electrode materials, which allows the energy to be stored on 
electrode/electrolyte interface through fast and reversible faradaic redox reactions, 
giving rise to a higher specific capacitance than that of EDLCs. The HSCs comprising 
a faradaic electrode material and a capacitive electrode material can combine the high 
energy density of PCs as well as the high powder density and long cycling life of 
EDLCs. Since the electrode material is the most important factor affecting the 
performance of HSCs, the development of high-performance electrode materials with 
delicate nanostructure and composition by convenient and low cost preparation 
process is highly desired. Among various pseudocapacitive materials, cobalt oxide is 
considered to be superior electrode material for SCs because of its high theoretical 
capacitance values (3650 F g-1), environmental friendliness, and high electrochemical stability.22 Moreover, the doping of sulfur can change the physical and chemical 
properties of the surface of the oxide material, and improving wettability and 
conductivity, thereby providing electrochemically active functional groups, 
generating more active sites, while maintaining the inherent properties of porous 
materials.23 Actually, transition metal sulfide (TMS) has been widely used as a 
high-performance electrode material for SCs, mainly due to richer redox reaction sites 
and higher electronic conductivity compared to corresponding metal 
oxides/hydroxides.15
 Coordination polymers/metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are formed by 
self-assembly of metal ions/clusters and organic ligands,24, 25 which are ideal 
precursor/templates for preparing electrode material due to its large specific surface 
area, high porosity, and diverse structures and functions.26 27-30Nitrilotriacetic acid 
(NTA) is an important ligand, which can provide four coordination bonds to metal 
ions.31 Besides, it is a small molecule, and thus has very strong complexing ability 
and can form stable chelate with various metal ions.32 The coordination between 
transition metal (M=Co, Ni, Mn etc.) and NTA ligand can form a serials of M-NTA 
1D nanorods.33-35 After simple thermal treatment, the precursor can be transformed 
into metal oxide with a one-dimensional (1D) porous nanostructure. Porous 
nanostructures have high energy storage performance as electrode materials1
. Besides, 
1D geometry shows superior electron transport properties.36
Inspired by the considerations above, herein, we report a facile coordination 
polymers-engaged strategy to construct 1D porous S-doped Co3O4 nanorods. The  synthesis process involves the coordination of Co2+ with NTA to form Co-NTA, 
annealing and solution sulfurization. The as-prepared S-doped Co3O4 materials were 
carefully characterized and used as electrode materials for SCs to evaluate their 
electrochemical performance. The S-doped Co3O4 materials inherit the basic 1D 
morphology of the Co-NTA precursor and the incorporation of S gives rise to rich 
oxygen vacancies while maintains the crystalline structure of Co3O4. Benefiting from 
the 1D porous nanorods structure and S doping, the electron transport is accelerated 
and the ion diffusion path is shortened, and more active sites are exposed. Therefore, 
the S-doped Co3O4 shows a high specific capacitance of 319.3 C g-1 at 0.5 A g-1
superior to intermediate Co3O4 (98.3 C g-1) and Co-NTA precursor (40.2 C g-1), along 
with an ultra-high rate capability of 83.3% with a 20-fold increase in current density 
(10 A g-1) and a good cycling durability (82.73% after 5000 cycles). Moreover, a HSC 
using the S-doped Co3O4 as faradaic electrode and an activated carbon (AC) as 
capacitive electrode exhibits a high energy density of 38.1 Wh kg-1 at a power density 
of 800 W kg-1 and excellent cycling stability of 87.57% capacitance retention after 
5000 cycles, implying that the S-doped Co3O4 is a very competitive electrode material 
for practical applications. This work demonstrates that morphology and structure 
engineering could be an effective strategy for fabricating high-performance electrodes 
for HSCs."
106_intro.txt.txt,"With the depletion of fossil fuels and environment deterioration, it is particularly important 
to investigate and develop high-efficient, low-cost, green and environment-friendly energy 
storage devices [1-3]. In recent years, supercapacitors (SCs) as a promising energy storage device 
have attracted tremendous attention due to their high power density, fast charge-discharge rate, 
and long cycling life etc. [4-6] The key factor that affects the implementation and production cost 
of SCs is the performance of electrode materials. Although the research on positive electrode 
materials have made great progress, the research on the negative electrode materials are 
relatively lagging. The development of high-performance and low-cost negative electrode 
materials is of great significance for the development of current supercapacitors [7]
. 
In previous studies, carbon-based materials with low cost, high electronic conductivity, and 
excellent cycling stability are the most investigated materials as the negative electrode in SCs 
[8-10]. Nevertheless, their major drawbacks are the intrinsic low specific capacitances due to the 
limited surface areas. Transition metal oxides (TMOs) are another kind of common negative 
electrode materials, which are promising electrodes for SCs as a result of a high theoretical 
capacity of about 1000 mAh g-1 [11, 12]
. As a member of TMOs, α-Fe2O3 stands out and has been 
intensively studied due to many excellent properties, such as non-toxicity, low cost, high 
3 
corrosion resistance and environmental friendliness [13-16]
. However, α-Fe2O3 usually possesses 
poor conductivity (~10-14 S cm-1), thus its capacitance performance is still far from theoretical 
specific capacitance. In addition, the large volume expansion of α-Fe2O3 during the charge and 
discharge processes induces its rapidly capacitance decline and poor rate performance. These 
drawbacks of α-Fe2O3 largely hamper its practical applications as negative electrode electrodes 
for high-performance SCs [13, 17, 18]
. Therefore, it is significant to explore α-Fe2O3 with high 
capacitance.
In order to solve the shortcomings of α-Fe2O3, researchers have carried out numerous 
researches and developed several strategies. On one hand, wrapping carbon materials or 
conductive polymers on the external surface of α-Fe2O3, as well as using flexible carbon fabric, 
ultrafine nickel nanotube arrays, and graphene sheet as conductive substrate to enhance the 
capacitive performance [16, 17, 19-23]. Although these means improve the electrochemical 
performance to some extent, they cannot change the intrinsic properties of α-Fe2O3. On the other 
hand, generating oxygen vacancy (Vo) via gas thermal treatment (H2 and N2) and chemical 
reduction (NaBH4) have been demonstrated as an effective approach that can modulate the 
electronic structures and increase donor density of TMOs to dramatically enhance their 
capacitance [24-26]. For instance, Lu et al [25] demonstrated the oxygen-deficient α-Fe2O3 nanorods 
obtained through annealing FeOOH in the N2 atmosphere. It showed a high area-specific 
capacitance of 382.7 mF cm-2 at 0.5 mA cm-2, which was two-fold higher than that of pristine 
Fe2O3. Sun et al [26] reported that chemical reduction via NaBH4 to yield richer oxygen vacancies 
(Vos) than N2 treatment could greatly enhance the performance of α-Fe2O3 (701 F g-1 at 1A g-1).
These studies prove that synthesizing hybrid materials and introducing oxygen-vacancy are able 
4 
to increase the capacitance of α-Fe2O3 via preventing the particle aggregation and inducing the 
extra lone pair electrons. However, it must be noted that these synthesis processes are often 
complicated and result in high production costs. Moreover, the multiple influencing factors in the 
reaction process cannot be well controlled. In terms of generating rich Vos, the usage of H2
should be avoided because it is a strong reducing agent, and highly explosive nature.
Additionally, it may introduce H as a dopant into the structure. Nitrogen streams is safe, yet 
produces Vos only at the surface region, which limiting the substantial improvement in 
electrochemical performance. NaBH4 as a reducing agent can be easily performed at room 
temperature and generate partially reduced surface and interior of metal oxides to increase the 
electron donor for improved redox reaction kinetics. However, the long reduction time by 
NaBH4 will sacrifice the structural stability of α-Fe2O3 on substrates. Therefore, developing a 
simple, effective, and easily-controlled strategy to synthesize stable and high-performance 
oxygen vacancy-rich α-Fe2O3 for achieving significant improvement in pseudocapacitive 
performance is of great importance. 
Hydrothermal method is an effective way to synthesize functional materials [27, 28]. Herein, 
for the first time, we report a controlled preparation of oxygen vacancy-rich α-Fe2O3
microspheres uniformly aligned on a carbon cloth (denoted as α-Fe2O3-Vo) by a one-step 
hydrothermal deposition method. The advantage of the synthesis method is that electrode 
material is directly synthesized from iron (℃) nitrate aqueous solution, without further annealing 
and additional reducing agent. By controlling the reaction temperature, the optimized electrode 
(at 160℃) shows a superior specific capacitance of 862.12 mF cm-2 (equal to 354.05 F g1) at a 
current density of 1 mA cm-2, and the pseudocapacitance contribution of 75.45% at the sweep 
5 
rate of 10 mV s-1
, which can be attributed to the introduction of abundant Vos in the α-Fe2O3. 
Compared with the pristine α-Fe2O3 electrode (146.5 mF cm-2 at 1 mA cm-2), the α-Fe2O3-Vo
microspheres electrode achieve higher areal capacitance and pseudocapacitance contribution 
values."
107_intro.txt.txt,"As a crucial half-cell reaction in overall water splitting and rechargeable 
metal-air batteries, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) have attracted widely 
attention[1-6]. Nevertheless, the sluggish kinetics and complex electron transfer 
process of OER restrict many catalysts’ application [7-10]. To decrease potential and 
achieve high catalytic activity for OER, there two basic principles can be applied to 
enhance the catalytic properties of catalysts. One is enhancing inherent catalytic 
activity which can be achieved through vacancy formation, element doping heteroatom doping and so on[11-13]. Another principle is adding the number of 
accessible active sites of catalyst materials, which can be achieved via enlarging 
specific area surface, exposing more active sites and choosing highly active catalytic 
materials[14-17]. In energy storage fields, supercapacitor is confined by the lower 
electrochemical activity, lower utilization, lower chemical stability and lower 
electrical conductivity of electrode materials. Changing the inherent characteristics of 
electrode materials will be an effective approach. As a crucial vacancy, oxygen 
vacancy has been testified to be an important factor to improve electrical conductivity 
and increase number of active sites for metal oxides[18-20]. As for the mechanism of 
oxygen vacancy enhance catalytic activity, the active site’s reactivity can be enhanced 
via oxygen vacancy catalytically activate neighboring atoms with increasing density 
of states that closed to the Fermi level.[21]. So, oxygen vacancy is worth to be 
explored.
In the past years, transition metal compounds have been generally applied to 
energy storage and conversion fields with their characteristics of high activity and rich 
valence state[22, 23]. Such as cobalt phosphides[24], cobalt sulfide[25], cobalt 
selenide[26] and cobalt nitrides[27] have made great progress in above two fields. 
Nevertheless, the synthetic methods of these active materials usually undergo an
environment unfriendly process. As a crucial and easily obtained transition-metal 
oxide, Co3O4 has been extensively studied in water splitting, metal-air batteries and 
supercapacitors with its abundant multiple oxidation state and metal ions valence
state[7, 28, 29]. However, the limited number of active sites and lower electrical conductivity for Co3O4 lead to its practical result is not well. Encouragingly, many 
reports have proven that introducing the oxygen vacancy into metal oxides is a 
feasible approach to modify their intrinsic electronic structure, control absorption 
energy and improve electrical conductivity, thus boosting the electrocatalytic activity 
and energy storage ability. In recent works, Sun et al. introduced oxygen vacancy 
defects into Co3O4 nanosheets and improved its OER performance[9]. Zheng et al. 
used NaBH4 reduced Co3O4 nanowires to improve its energy storage ability in 
supercapacitor[30]. Also, Li et al. reduced ternary oxide including NiCo2O4, 
CoMn2O4 and NiMn2O4 by NaBH4 solution treatment and also achieved efficient 
water electrolysis[21]. Therefore, construction of unique hollow structure with 
abundant oxygen vacancy is a good approach to achieve highly catalytic and energy 
storage performances for metal oxides.
Herein, we introduce oxygen vacancy into Co3O4 via a facile method of aldehyde 
reduction. The aldehyde can be produced in the mixture solution of ethylene glycol
with NaOH at a moderate temperature[9]. Such a mild environment provides a 
possibility to reduce metal oxides and generate oxygen vacancies, and the pristine 
crystalline/microstructure can be retained. The electrochemical measurement results 
show that the reduced Co3O4 (R-Co3O4) possesses a high electrical conductivity and a 
larger active surface area benefited by the introduction of oxygen vacancy. And the 
morphology structure was not damaged after the procedure. As expected, the R-Co3O4
delivers a superior OER activity with a comparably lower potential of 1.55 V (vs RHE) 
and a smaller Tafel slope of 71 mV dec-1
. Furthermore, R-Co3O4 also exhibits remarkable stability: the polarization curves of before and after a 15 h constant 
current stability measurement at 10 mA cm−2
are coincided. Additionally, the R-Co3O4
can achieve about 1.7 times capacitance of pristine Co3O4 in supercapacitor. The
excellent stability of R-Co3O4 possessed: after 5000 charge-discharge cycles, the 
capacitance of 115% can be maintained. And the R-Co3O4 exhibits a longer 
discharging time and a larger cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves area than that of initial
after 5000 cycles. An aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor was assembled based on the 
R-Co3O4 as positive electrode and N-doped C on carbon cloth (CC@NC) as negative 
electrode also showed better performance. All the results reveal that cobalt-based 
oxides with abundant oxygen vacancy will be promising.CV, (b) GCD curves and (c) Areal capacitances at various current densities. (d)

), the R-Co3O4 delivers a higher areal capacitance of 1.27 F cm-2
(325.6 
F g-1
) at a current density of 1 mA cm-2
. Additionally, according to the 
charge-discharge curves at various current densities (Figure S4a-b), the rate capability 
of R-Co3O4 and pristine Co3O4 was calculated (shown in Figure 6c). The R-Co3O4
electrode can retain 86.9% capacitance with increasing current density from 1 to 10 
mA cm-2
, which is close to pristine Co3O4. The results indicate that a high capacitance 
can be achieved at a higher charging current density of as-prepared samples.
Significantly, the cycling stability is a key factor to estimate electrochemical property
of supercapacitor. The 5000 successive GCD cycles was tested at a charge-discharge 
current density of 15 mA cm-2
. In Figure 6d and Figure S4c, the capacitance of 
R-Co3O4 and pristine Co3O4 are retained about 115% and 118% of their initial values electrons. The number of active sites was increased with introducing oxygen vacancy 
into the electrode material, which is beneficial to boost the sluggish kinetics process 
of OER. Also, we further extended the application of R-Co3O4 to supercapacitor, 
which still achieve a better performance. The superior performs in OER and 
supercapacitor are attributed to oxygen vacancy. In general, the strategy of oxygen 
vacancy formation may be suitable for other metal oxides."
108_intro.txt.txt,"Constantly growing energy demand has greatly stimulated the
development of high-performance energy storage and conversion
systems [1,2]. Based on the extraordinary merits of rapid charge/
discharge rate, ultrahigh power density, long cycling life and environmental friendliness, utmost attention has been focused on
supercapacitors (SCs) [3]. Nevertheless, the low energy density of
SCs significantly limits their wider-spread applications [4]. Likewise, as a significant half-reaction of electrochemical water splitting, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has been received huge
attention. Whereas, it is pressing to develop high active electrocatalysts due to the sluggish kinetics of OER [5]. Hence, it is significant
to realize the integration of the energy storage and electrocatalytic
functions via only one active electrode material.
NiCo2O4, which is a low-cost, environment friendly and high
stability spinel-type structure, shows important redox activity for
energy storage and OER due to abundant oxidation states and synergistic effects of multiple metal species compared with singlecomponent metal oxides [6–9]. However, traditional NiCo2O4
materials have poor conductivity due to volume changes during
the electrochemical process, and insufficient concentrations of
active sites would limit their practical multifunctional applications
[10,11]. Modification of supercapacitor electrode materials and
electrocatalysts at the molecular level can effectively enhance the
kinetics and activity of electrochemical and electrocatalytic reactions, such as the reasonable structural design [12] and
transition-metal doping [13]. On the one hand, compared with
large pure bulk metal oxides, open structures such as porous,
needle-like and ultrathin sheet-like structures have a larger
exposed outer and inner surface and a lower atomic coordination
number [14]. On the other hand, properly doped atoms can
enhance the energy storage and reaction kinetics of the material,
resulting in structural distortion [15].
At present, different metal atoms, such as Mn [16], Cr [17] and
Fe [18], have been tried and doped into NiCo2O4 to obtain the
improved electrochemical performance. However, there are still
some optimizations in this field that need to be further studied.
Firstly, the specific capacitance and overpotential of these metaldoped NiCo2O4 materials are still not satisfactory, which may be
due to their crystalline states. Conversely, the amorphous transition metal materials could provide more ion channels and active
sites than the crystalline one [19]. Then, Mo may be a better metal
dopant of NiCo2O4. Mo, a non-3D high-valence metal, was have
proved to be desired dopants due of its special superiorities in optimizing the Gibbs free energy (DG) for electrochemical and electrocatalytic intermediate formation [20–22]. Meanwhile, the atomic
structure of Mo is similar to that of Co and Ni, which is highly
favorable for doping reaction [23]. Therefore, designing amorphous
Mo-doped NiCo2O4 with a porous cross-linked network structure
can combine all their benefits, is yet still challenging.
Herein, we propose a simple two-step method for in-situ
growth of Mo-doped amorphous NiCo2O4 nanoneedles on nickel
foam (Mo-NiCo2O4/NF) through a hydrothermal reaction followed
by calcination processes. Compared with other transition metal
materials, the optimized Mo-NiCo2O4/NF have a porous crosslinked network structure, which facilitates electron transport.
Moreover, the introduction of amorphous structure and inheritance of oxidation stability also promotes faster charge storage
kinetics and accommodates the volume change of Mo-NiCo2O4.
What’s more surprising, Mo-NiCo2O4/NF underwent a rapid selfreconstruction process during OER that produced rich oxygen
vacancies and thus exhibited remarkable long-term stability. This
work provides new insights into modification of metal oxides by
Mo dopants and hold great potential in low-cost multifunctional

109_intro.txt.txt,"great deal of research activity has been devoted to 2D
inorganic nanosheets (NSs) because of their interesting physicochemical properties and diverse functionalities originating from their unusually high morphological
anisotropy.1 Many 2D inorganic NSs and their nanohybrids
boast excellent energy-related performances as electrodes for
batteries and supercapacitors, electrocatalysts, photocatalysts,
and so on.2,3 To further improve the functionalities of
inorganic NSs, several synthetic strategies have been exploited,
such as chemical substitution, dimension control, surface
modification, and hybridization.4 Considering that coordinatively unsaturated defects can act as efficient electrochemically
active sites, fine control of the defect structure is supposed to
be quite effective in enhancing the electrode and catalyst
performances of inorganic NSs.5 The introduction of a crystal
defect has been well known to effectively improve the
electronic conductivity of semiconductors by narrowing their
band-gap energies.6 Additionally, the provision of defect sites
allows one to optimize the activation energy and the
adsorption energy of ionic or gaseous species in the electrolyte,
which is beneficial for energy-related applications, such as
supercapacitor electrodes, electrocatalysts, fuel cells, photocatalysts, and so on.7−11 Such advantages of defect
introduction have evoked intense research efforts to develop
feasible synthetic routes to defective inorganic solids like
thermal reduction, plasma treatment, chemical reduction,
photoreduction, selective etching, and chemical substitution.7,8 In addition to the defect introduction, a fine-tuning of the
stacking structure of inorganic NSs can provide an alternative
useful method to improve the energy-related performance of
inorganic NSs via the optimization of porosity and charge/
mass-transport properties.7 The synergetic combination of
both the defect introduction and the porosity control of
inorganic NSs offers a valuable opportunity to explore highperformance electrode/catalyst materials. To date, there is,
however, no report about the simultaneous tailoring of the
defect and stacking structures of inorganic NSs. It is therefore
necessary to develop an efficient and economic synthetic route
to defective inorganic NSs with a controlled stacking structure.
Among the many classes of inorganic NSs, the great
compositional diversity, facile and cost-effective synthesis,
and valuable functionalities render layered double hydroxide
(LDH) NSs highly promising candidates for electrodes,
catalysts, adsorbents, and drug-delivery vectors.9−11 Considering the relatively low lattice energy of the LDH originating
from the monovalent valence state of hydroxide ions, a loading
of sufficient physical stress might cause the formation of crystal
defects via the enhancement of the elastic deformation of the
LDH lattice.11 The control of the intercalant size enables the
elastic deformation of the LDH lattice to be tailored, thus
creating crystal vacancies in a controlled manner, because the
hybridization with bulky intercalant species induces significant
lattice strain of 2D LDH crystallites. Simultaneously, the
alteration of the intercalant size and the charge density makes
possible the fine-tuning of a chemical interaction between
restacked LDH NSs.12 The resulting change of attractive force
between cationic LDH NSs and guest anions is supposed to
allow the stacking number of LDH layers to be tailored. The
previous study about the restacked assembly of metal oxide NSs demonstrated that the change in the interlayer spacing
surely induces a significant alteration of the stacking thickness
and porosity of restacked NSs.13 This Article demonstrates the
crucial role of the attractive interaction between the host and
the guest in tailoring the stacking thickness and the porosity of
restacked NSs. Considering that the increase in the intercalant
size would reduce the lattice energy of the final product,
employing bulky anions with a low charge density as
intercalants can provide a powerful methodology not only to
simultaneously tailor their defect and stacking structures via
enhanced elastic deformation but also to optimize their
functionalities as electrodes and catalysts. Although there is
some research about the intercalation chemistry of the LDH,
most of the studies have focused only on the alteration of basal
spacing.14−16 At the time of this submission, we were unaware
of any other study about the simultaneous control of the
defect/stacking structures of inorganic NSs.
In this study, an effective lattice engineering methodology
for simultaneous control of the defect and pore structures of
LDH is developed by adjusting the elastic deformation and
attractive interaction of LDH NSs. The alteration of intercalant
size for the restacking of LDH NSs allows defective LDH NSs
with variable stacking and pore structures to be yielded. The
effects of the guest size on the defect content, stacking
thickness, and functionalities of LDH NSs are systematically
investigated together with the underlying mechanism responsible for the fine control of defect/stacking structures."

chemical reactions, capacitance related to the electrode charging
potential is obtained [4].
Among traditional pseudocapacitor materials, MnO2, NiO, SnO2
and V2O5 store energy by rapid redox reaction [5–8]. In recent
years, several novel capacitive materials containing oxygen vacancies were synthesized by constructing lattice vacancy in traditional
pseudo-capacitor materials. The capacitance can be generated by
adsorption and desorption of ions in the electrolyte through oxygen vacancy on the surface of electrode along with redox reactions
[9]. Such electrode material is of great significance in the selection
of functional materials for portable equipment due to its high volume specific capacitance [10]. Oxygen-poor state MoO3-x leads to
a larger layer spacing compared to the fully oxidized MoO3. This
phenomenon is ascribed to the oxygen vacancy, which promotes
faster charge storage kinetics and preserves the α-MoO3 structure
during insertion and removal of Li ions [11]. Lin et al. [12] prepared monodisperse/polydisperse TiO2 precursor submicrospheres
by sol–gel method through mixing the precursor with LiOH and
sucrose to form Li4Ti5O12-x/C containing oxygen vacancy in argon atmosphere at 800 °C as a cathode material for lithium diffusion were significantly higher than those of Li4Ti5O12 with
complete stoichiometric ratio. The potential importance of introducing oxygen vacancy to transition metal oxides to improve the
charge storage kinetics of active redox substances was extensively
emphasized [13].
In recent years, perovskite-type metal oxides as supercapacitor
materials have been presented in several reports [14,15]. Perovskite
oxides with oxygen vacancy have become promising electrode materials. It was found that oxygen intercalation has a significant
influence on layered perovskite nanoparticles as supercapacitor
electrodes. Mefford et al. [16] prepared LaMnO3±0.09 by inverse
hydrolysis reverse method, and found that the specific capacitance
of LaMnO3.09 was higher than LaMnO2.91 in alkaline solution. They
further explained that phenomenon by using alkaline solution of
different anion concentrations and neutral electrolytes. In addition
to traditional perovskite oxides, the synthesis of double perovskite
material with oxygen vacancy has also been reported [17]. The
PrBaMn2O6−δ was synthesized by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acidanhydrous citric acid (EDTA-CA) complexing approach, which can
reach a maximum gravimetric capacitance of 1034.8 F/g in 6 M
KOH solution with a small specific surface area of only 7.83 m2/g
[18].
At present, various methods for synthesizing, such as sol–gel,
reverse hydrolysis, complexation method combined with argon or
hydrogen sintering have been reported [19,20]. However, those
methods require multi-step reactions for production of perovskite
oxygen vacancy materials. Therefore, they are not easily applicable for large-scale industry. Herein, a new molten salt method is
proposed for synthesizing the perovskite materials containing oxygen vacancy molten salt. KNO3–NaNO3–NaNO2 (53:7:40 wt%) system with the melting point range of 140 °C–155 °C was selected
as molten salt media in which perovskite oxide was synthesized.
Moreover, reaction precursor can sink at the bottom of crucible because of its small density and viscosity. The property of oxidation
and the low melting point for our system facilitates reaction precursor to sink at the bottom of crucible, allowing the reaction to
proceed without the need to contact with a large amount of air
[21]. One advantage of molten salt method is that the sealing devices are not required for setting up the experimental conditions.
As a result, huge amounts of perovskite materials can be simply
produced [22,23]. For supercapacitor material, the energy can be
stored by both redox reaction and vacancy adsorption of OH− ions
in an alkaline electrolyte. Consequently, high capacitance can be
obtained without using materials of high specific surface area. In
this study, perovskite oxide LaMnO3-δ as a supercapacitor material
was synthesized by the molten salt method. The morphology and
oxygen vacancy of LaMnO3-δ were determined by various characterization methods. The electrochemical properties were characterized by several electrochemical measurements. The specific capacitance of the first gravimetric discharge cycle can reach 973.6 F/g
at current density of 1 A/g in 6 M KOH."
111_intro.txt.txt,"Because of rapid depletion of fossil fuels and severe environmental pollution, clean and highly-efficient energy storage devices
are greatly demanded. Supercapacitor, as one of the most promising clean and renewable energy storage techniques, has advantages such as high power density, short charging time, high rate
capacity and good cycling stability [1e4]. In recent years, many
metal oxide nanomaterials have been explored as the supercapacitor electrode materials [5], including RuO2 [6], Co3O4 [7,8],
NiO [9,10], MnO2 [11,12], CuO [13], SnO2 [14,15], V2O5 [16], Fe3O4
[17,18], a-Fe2O3 [19], TiO2 [20] and CeO2 [21,22]. Among them, CeO2
is an eco-friendly electrode material with low toxicity and excellent
chemical stability, and can be operated in various acidic and alkaline electrolytes [23e26]. Furthermore, the fast transition between
Ce(III) and Ce(IV) oxidation states makes the CeO2 a promising
electrode material for supercapacitors [27].
Accordingly, various CeO2 nanostructures have been prepared to
improve their electrochemical performance, such as nanospheres
[21], nanorods [22,28,29], nanowires [21], nanoparticles [27,30]
and porous nanostructures [31], etc. However, at present the specific capacity produced from these CeO2 nanostructures reported in
literature are still quite low. For examples, CeO2 nanorods exhibited
a specific capacitance of 162.47 F g1 at the current density of
1Ag1 in the 3 M KOH electrolyte [22]. The CeO2 nanospheres
showed a specific capacitance of 142.5 F g1 at the current density
of 0.25 A g1 in the Na2SO4 electrolyte [27]. The porous CeO2
exhibited a specific capacitance of 134.6 F g1 at the current density
of 1 A g1 in the 1 M KOH electrolyte [31].
In order to enhance its capacity, the CeO2 has been modified
using carbon nanomaterials. For examples, Deng et al. [32] reported
that composite of CeO2 nanoparticles/multi-wall carbon nanotubes
showed an enhanced large specific capacitance of 455.7 F g1 at the
current density of 2 A g1 in the 1 M KOH electrolyte, while the
specific capacitance of pristine CeO2 nanoparticles was only
73.7 F g1
. Padmanathan et al. [29] reported that the carbon coated
CeO2 nanorods achieved a large specific capacitance of 644 F g1 at
a current density of 0.5 A g1 in the 3 M KOH electrolyte. Another method to enhance the specific capacitance of CeO2 is doping with
metal ions. For example, Murugan et al. [26] prepared Co doped
CeO2 nanoparticles using a microwave synthesis method, and
showed a much larger specific capacitance of 573 F g1 than that of
pure CeO2 nanoparticles (235 F g1
) at a current density of 2 A g1
in the 1 M KOH electrolyte. The specific capacitance of Ni doped
CeO2 nanoparticles was also reported to increase to 577 F g1 from
the 235 F g1 of pure CeO2 nanoparticles at the current density of
2Ag1 in the 1 M KOH electrolyte [30]. Although the specific capacities of these modified CeO2 based electrode materials have
been remarkably improved, these values are still not good enough
for the practical applications [33,34]. Therefore, it is still a great
challenge to further optimize the CeO2 nanostructures for
achieving high specific capacity.
It is well known that the large surface area, abundant pores and
hierarchical nanostructures are beneficial to their good electrochemical performance of electrode materials [35,36]. Therefore, in
order to obtain good electrochemical performance, it is believed
that design and fabrication of CeO2 hierarchical nano-architectures
with small nanocrystal size, large surface area and extraordinary
porosity should be the best solution. Because Zr4þ the same valence
state and similar ionic radii with Ce4þ ions, some Ce4þ ions can be
substituted by Zr4þ ions in the CeO2 in the synthesis process, which
is facilitates to obtain the CeO2 with small nanocrystal size, large
surface area and extraordinary porosity [37]. Accordingly, in this
study, we designed and fabricated mesoporous Zr-doped CeO2
nanostructures using a hydrothermal method and an assisted
calcination process in order to achieve high supercapacitor performance. The mesoporous Zr-doped CeO2 nanostructures achieved extraordinary porosity, small nanocrystal size and large
surface area. The extraordinary porosity and hierarchical nanoarchitecture can shorten the diffusion paths of the electrolyte and
facilitate the efficient utilization of the active materials for
enhancing the faradaic reactions. The small nanocrystals size and
large surface area provide abundant active sites for the Faradaic
redox reactions.
Our results using this specially designed electrode material
showed that the mesoporous CeO2-Zr-1 nanostructure (with
atomic ratio of Ce:Zr ¼ 10:1) exhibited a significantly enhanced
specific capacity of 448.1 C g1 at a current density of 1 A g1
. An
asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) based on CeO2-Zr-1//activated
carbon (AC) was further made and showed an energy storage
density of 23.3 Wh kg1 at 398.5 W kg1
, and a good long-term
cycling stability with only 3.6% capacity loss after 6000 cycles."
112_intro.txt.txt,"As a new type of energy storage device, smart wearable supercapacitor has 
attracted wide attention on account of its moderate energy density, high power 
density, and safe operation.[1-5, 50] Although the superiorities are obvious, there are 
still challenges about the large-scale applications, driving us to explore higher 
performance supercapacitors. For flexible supercapacitors, the electrode material is 
the critical component to determine the overall performance of devices, including 
energy density, lifespan, mechanical stability, and so on. [6, 53] Compared with 
carbon-based capacitor-type (non-faradaic) electrodes, battery-type (faradic) 
electrode, especially for transition metal oxides, exhibits higher specific capacitance 
and energy density, which are due to multiple oxidation states that enable intense 
redox reactions. [7-8] What’s more, the optimizations on the nanoarchitectures of 
electrode materials are also necessary. Therefore, it is necessary to consider a feasible 
strategy to design and synthesize nanoarchitectures for supercapacitor electrodes. [9] 
Porous structures are regarded as an effective strategy to improve the activities by 
expanding the active surface areas to provide more reaction sites and reducing the 
transmission path of ion in materials. [10] Thus, many researches have been 
concentrating on methods, which can enhance the specific surface areas, increase 
active sites or compose novel special nanostructures in order to enhance the 
capacitances and conductivities for these materials. [11-14, 51-52]
Until now, there are a large number of works reported about transition metal 
oxides, such as RuO2, ZnO and Co3O4. [15-17] These materials exhibit excellent 
advantages, such as environment friendly and high theoretical capacitance. In 
addition, compared with mono-metal oxides, bimetallic oxides containing nickel and 
cobalt ions can provide more abundant redox process, making them possess higher 
specific capacitance performance. Recently, many works about NiCo2O4 materials 
electrode have been reported. Wang and co-works designed the mesoporous NiCo2O4
directly coated on an ultrafine nickel as the electrode, and the energy density of 
corresponding supercapacitor is 77 Wh kg-1 at 35 kW kg-1
. [18] Ouyang et al. 
synthesized hierarchical NiO ultrathin nanosheets anchored to NiCo2O4, and the 
corresponding supercapacitor has the energy density of 27.9 Wh kg-1 at 0.375 kW 
kg-1. [19] Although great advances of the supercapacitors have gotten, there are still 
demands to make hard effort to improve the energy density. Therefore, more attention 
should be paid to synthesize electrode materials with favorable mechanically robust, 
remarkable energy and power densities. Furthermore, increasing focus have been 
directed to doping of heteroatoms, such as S, P or B to increase the electrochemical 
performance. [20] Guo and co-works designed Ni-Co-B hollow nanospheres, [21] and 
Sheng et al. synthesized network-like porous Co-Ni-B. [22] However, as the faraday 
redox reactions of B-doping oxide metal electrode materials are highly dependent on 
the material surfaces and for the slow reaction kinetics under high current density, 
only low capacitance retention and poor electrochemical stability can be achieved. 
Therefore, it is necessary to rationally design electrode materials with excellent 
structure to improve the conductivity and atomic utilization ratio, while effectively 
shortening the electron/ion diffusion path. 
In our work, B-NiCo2O4 on carbon fabric (CF) is synthesized, which delivers 
higher conductivity and capacitance compared with pure metal oxides owing to the 
introduction of oxygen vacancies and heteroatoms. The B-NiCo2O4 electrode 
possesses a high capacitance of 799.9 C g-1 at 1 A g-1 with excellent rate capability of 
74.9% capacitance retention at 20 A g-1. Besides, the B-NiCo2O4 electrode materials 
have excellent cycling performance, and 94.7% of the initial specific capacity is 
retained after 5000 cycles. The as-assembled asymmetric supercapacitor realizes a 
high density of 77.7 Wh kg-1 at 2890.8 W kg-1 and outstanding stability of nearly 91% 
retention after 5000 cycles."
113_intro.txt.txt,"Electrochemical energy storage systems, such as lithium batteries and supercapacitors have shown great prospects in slowing
fossil fuel exhaustion and environmental pollution [1e3]. Normally,
it is recognized that supercapacitors bridge the gaps between
batteries and conventional capacitors, exhibiting high power density, faster charging/discharging rate, excellent rate capability and
longer cycle lifetime [4,5]. The development of novel supercapacitors combined with sensing characteristics (pressure, electrochromic, photoelectric etc.) has attracted much attention in
recent years, leading to the gradual emergence in many high-tech
fields as promising energy storage devices [6e11]. However,
supercapacitors are usually suffered by relatively low energy
density, limiting their applications [12]. Nowadays, many researches are working on increasing the energy density of supercapacitors. A high specific capacitance (C) is essential for a high
energy density, actually a wide operation voltage window (V) plays
a more significant role, as the energy (E) follows the formula:
E ¼ 1
2 CV2 (1)
In fact, the electrochemical properties of supercapacitor depend
strongly on the electrode materials. Carbon materials, metal oxides
and conductive polymers have been extensively studied as electrode materials for supercapacitors [13,14]. Among them, transition
metal oxides have gained significant interests due to their higher
energy density than carbon materials and better cycling stability
than conductive polymers. Meanwhile, transition metallic elements often have multiple oxidation states, and the corresponding
compounds have different crystalline phases and morphology
[15,16]. Thus, transition metals are of great value in the design and
development of new inorganic functional materials. However, the

Fe2O3 etc., in supercapacitors is seriously restricted by low electrical
conductivity, limited cycle stability or narrow potential windows
[17e19]. As demand, various hybrid supercapacitors that combine
the mechanisms of carbon materials and transition metal oxides in
a single electrode or device, have been extensive researched
recently, which exhibit higher electrical conductivity, higher cycle
stability and wider potential windows [20e22]. On the other hand,
searching a new type of transition metal oxides which can intrinsically optimize the correlative parameters of electrochemistry is
also an important issue.
ABO3 perovskite oxides and perovskite-related compounds have
been used as the key materials of various electronic components
due to their special crystal structure and rich physicochemical
properties. Generally, the A-site cation is trivalent lanthanide
element (La3þ, Sm3þ, etc.) or bivalent alkali earth element (Ca2þ,
Sr2þ, Ba2þ,etc.), and B-site is usually occupied by transition metal
element (Mn, Ni, Co, Fe, Ti, etc.). Since Kudo et al. [23] first published the electrochemical reactions of perovskite type metal oxide
in ionic solution, the electrochemical behaviors of several perovskite oxides have been successively studied. The electrochemical
reactions occur on the surface of oxide electrode have been widely
confirmed, however, the charge storage mechanism of perovskite
oxides have rarely been reported during the early studies. Until
2014, Mefford et al. [24] put forwards the anion-intercalation
mechanism for LaMnO3 perovskite as the electrode material of
supercapacitors for the first time, and the oxygen-vacancy tailored
redox is also firstly proposed for fast energy storage. The oxygenvacancy concentration in perovskite oxides can be tailored by
partial substitution on A-site and/or B-site, resulting in an effective
control over the crystal structure, electrical conductivity and electrochemical performance.
Thereafter, perovskite oxide, especially the La-based perovskite
oxide LaBO3 (B ¼ Mn, Ni, Co, etc.) have attracted wide attention as a
new kind of promising electrode material for supercapacitor, and a
series of correlation studies have been carried out successively
[25e27]. The La-based perovskite oxides are found to have many
advantages such as improved electrical conductivity, wide voltage
window (large than 1 V) and good cycling stability. A common
approach to improve the electrical conductivity of La-based LaBO3
perovskites is by partial substitution of bivalent alkaline earth
(Ca2þ, Sr2þ etc.) for trivalent lanthanide on A-site, through which
more oxygen vacancies are introduced. Thus oxygen-vacancy
tailored electrochemical performance can be optimized at a
proper substitution amount [27e31]. Meanwhile, the charge
imbalance after substitution is partially compensated by the
oxidation of Mn3þ(d4
) to Mn4þ(d3
) in the B sub-lattice, together
with the Jahn-Teller effect of Mn3þ ions, leading to the perovskite
structure distortion [32]. The phase structure of perovskite is
thought to have a great influence on the oxygen vacancy concentration, the O2 diffusivity, as well as the electrochemical behavior
accordingly [33]. However, it is important to note that Ca (rCa2þ ¼
1.34 Å) is slightly smaller than La ( rLa3þ ¼ 1.36 Å), while Sr (
rSr2þ ¼ 1.44 Å) is relatively larger than La [34], thus the effect of their
respective substitution on the structure of LaMnO3, and the
resulting electrochemical performance should be different. The
structural evolution and electronic properties of La1-xMxMnO3
(M ¼ Sr, Ca) perovskites have been reported by some researches
[35,36], while their resulting electrochemical performances, which
are closely related to structural evaluation, have rarely been discussed together.
In this work, LaMnO3, La0$85Ca0$15MnO3 and La0$85Sr0$15MnO3
(denoted as LMO, LCM and LSM) samples were prepared by the solgel method. The structure and surface morphology of LaMnO3
perovskite with different A-site substitutions have been
investigated, and the resulting influence on the electrochemical
performance are revealed correspondingly"
114_intro.txt.txt,"Nowadays, the rapid development of wearable electronics and smart 
devices provide the urgent requirement of flexible high-performance 
energy storage devices [1–3]. Supercapacitors possessing the superiorities of low cost, fast charging speed, high power density, long cycle life 
and environment-friendly have attracted great attention and considered 
to be the most potential energy storage systems. Typically, the development of supercapacitors with light weight, excellent mechanical 
flexibility and large power/energy density are necessary [4–6]. However, the relatively low energy density restricted the large-scale applications. Thus, it is urgent to develop flexible supercapacitors electrode 
materials with high energy density. According to the energy density 
formula E = 1/2CV2
, the energy density of supercapacitor device can 
increase by the superior specific capacitance (C) and the extended 
voltage window (V) [7–9]. Therefore, it is prospective to develop 
flexible asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) assembled by active materials 
with higher specific capacitance and enlarged the operation potential 
window to achieve higher energy density. 
MnO2 as a kind of semiconductor material with high theoretical 
capacitance, abundant resources, low price and non-toxic has considered to be a suitable choice in electrochemical energy storage electrode 
[10–12]. However, the comparatively low conductivity and the structure collapse in the charging and discharging process severely restrict 
the reaction kinetics and decay the electrochemical performance [13]. 
Consequently, many efforts have been devoted to construct heterostructure upon other architecture to prevent structure collapse or 
introduce defects (doping or vacancy) optimizing the electronic structure to improve the electrical conductivity. Zhang et al. developed P 
doped Ni(OH)2@MnO2 core–shell structure as cathode material and 
assembled the high performance asymmetric supercapacitors [14]. Deng 
et al. constructed Co3O4@MnO2-PPy hybrid nanostructure for high  performance flexible supercapacitors. In which the cooperated highcapacitive MnO2 with conductive PPy generated a strong molecular 
coupling at the molecular level and thus enormously improve the utilization efficiency of MnO2 and promote the electron transfer efficiency 
[15]. Gao et al. introduced oxygen vacancy into MnO2 nanorod arrays 
by annealing at H2 atmosphere, which effectively improved the conductivity and obtained the specific capacitance of 874.5F g− 1 at a current density of 0.25 A g− 1 [16]. Wang et al. modulated MnO2 nanosheets 
by substitutional doping and assembled it into high performance 
printable solid-state micro-supercapacitors [17]. As a result, the defects 
engineering was considered as an effective way to improve the conductivity and promote the electrochemical performance. 
In addition to the aforementioned cathode material structure and 
electric structure regulation, the assembled anode material is also 
important for the hybrid asymmetric supercapacitor systems [18]. In 
consequence, Zinc-ion hybrid supercapacitors (ZHS) was emerged as 
promising energy storage devices and drawn considerable attention 
recently [19]. That is mainly attributed to the inherent advantages of 
zinc, as relatively high theoretical capacity of 820 mAh g− 1
, a low redox 
potential versus the standard hydrogen electrode (-0.76 V), costeffectiveness and abundant resources [20,21]. In consequence, it is 
significant to construct heterostructure and optimize the electric structure simultaneously to develop effective cathode material and assemble 
with high-capacity anode material to establish high performance 
supercapacitors. 
In this work, we report an oxygen vacancy modulated Co9S8@MnO2 
core–shell heterostructure cathode electrode material with promotional 
electrochemical performance. The Co9S8 nanotube arrays were acted as 
supporting skeleton that can facilitate electronic transmission through 
the interface and provide a larger surface area for the deposition of 
MnO2. Oxygen vacancy engineering can improve the inherent conductivity of MnO2 and increase the electrochemical active area. It should be 
noted that the voltage window of as-prepared Co9S8@MnO2-60 electrode can be enlarged to 1.1 V, with a high areal capacitance of 3.7F 
cm− 2 and the assembled flexible all-solid asymmetric supercapacitors 
(AAS) can achieve a maximum voltage window of 2.4 V, which is far 
higher than most current electrode materials. Meanwhile, the high energy density of 92.14 Wh kg− 1 at a power density of 342.86 W kg− 1 is 
obtained. Furthermore, Zn-ion hybrid supercapacitor is also assembled 
with a high energy density of 198.857 Wh kg− 1
, which is about twice 
than that of AAS devices. So, it is a promising strategy to combine highenergy Zn anode with high-power supercapacitors cathode to develop 
the high-performance energy storage device."

candidates to bridge the gap of traditional capacitors and

categorized as pseudocapacitors and electrical double-layer

good electrode material for energy storage and conversion
devices [18]. However, pristine nanostructured MoO3 lacks
excellent electrochemical performance mainly due to low
conductivity and insufficient active sites. Recent studies in
improving the electric capacity of MoO3 mainly involve:
(1) coupling with conductive carbon materials such as
active carbon, graphene, and carbon nanotubes; [19, 20] (2)
compositing with conductive polymers, e.g., PPy and PANI
[21]; and (3) increasing the number of active sites in
nanostructures. However, MoO3 could not form complete,
uniform composites with carbon materials or polymers,
resulting in the limited capacitive enhancement. It has been
recently reported that the generation of oxygen vacancies
and partial reduction of Mo6? to the lower valence of
Mo5?, Mo4?, or Mo3? can improve the intrinsic conductivity of MoO3 and thus increase the pseudocapacitive
properties [22]. For example, sulfur-doped and hydrogendoped MoO3 were used to enhance pseudocapacitive
behavior by generating oxygen vacancies [10, 23]. However, the mechanisms of oxygen vacancies to enhance
charge storage in MoO3 supercapacitors are not completely
clear.
In this work, the oxygen deficiency (x) in the MoO3-x
nanobelts is tailored by carbonizing the MoO3 nanobelts as
a function of the annealing temperature (Ta) varying from
400 to 550 C in the CO atmosphere. The specific capacitance (C) of MoO3-x, evaluated by cyclic voltammetry
(CV) methods, has substantial dependence on the x and
microstructures. Characterizations with ex-situ Raman,
X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies (XPS), together with density functional theory
(DFT) calculation, were operated to study the charge
storage mechanisms at the atomic scale. Our study provides
a fundamental understanding on enhancing the reversible
supercapacitance through the formation of oxygen vacancies, highly desired for high-efficient energy storage and
conversion"
116_intro.txt.txt,"Deploying efficient methods of converting and storing energy from clean renewables is a key 
step for realizing the shift away from high dependence on traditional fossil fuels toward the 
utilization of cost effective and clean solar and wind power. Electrochemical energy storage is 
believed to be one of the most promising choices to bridge the gap between the intermittent nature of 
renewable energy (solar, wind and tidy energy) and state-of-the-art electric grid, thus providing a 
new sustainable energy system for the future.[1-3] Supercapacitors are one important type of 
electrochemical energy storage devices characterized by high power density (higher than 
conventional batteries), high energy density (higher than conventional capacitors) and long cycling 
lifetime (up to millions of cycles), which may play an important role in such new energy system if 
their energy density can be further improved.[4-6]
Conventional supercapacitors are based on electric double layer capacitance, for which the 
energy is stored through the building of electric double layers with high activated carbon as the most 
popular electrode, which has capacitance of about 200 F g-1.[7] More recently, pseudocapacitors, 
which take advantage of fast multi-electron Faradaic redox reactions at the electrodes, have received 
considerable attentions as a new type of supercapacitors with energy density up to ten times higher 
than conventional electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs).[8-10] This redox pseudocapacitance 
occurs when ions are electrochemically adsorbed onto the surface or subsurface of an electrode 
material with a concomitant faradaic charge-transfer.[11] Intercalation-type pseudocapacitance is 
emerged as a new energy storage mechanism, which the charge storage occurs when ions (mainly Li+
and Na+
) intercalate into the tunnels, defect sites (near defect sites), or layers of a redox-active 
material, accompanied by a faradaic charge-transfer without crystallographic phase change.[12-17] 
The advantage of intercalation-type capacitors is that high capacitance could be achieved for 
electrodes with low surface area, thus affording the possibility of ultrahigh volumetric specific 
energy density.

In addition to the cation-intercalation pseudocapacitance, anion-intercalation 
pseudocapacitance have also received attentions recently.[18, 19] The use of aqueous solution as 
electrolyte in anion-intercalation type supercapacitors brings about the advantages of environmental 
benignity and safe operation. As well, high ionic conductivity can be easily achieved for aqueous 
solution, enabling high power density and excellent rate capability. Recently, perovskite oxides have 
been studied as electrodes of oxygen anion intercalation type supercapacitors.[19-21] Compared to 
the Li+
 or Na+
 cations, which just contains one positive charge per unit, the O2- can carry two 
negative charges per unit, which means that the intercalation pseudocapacitance of O2- can store 
twice charges in one charge/discharge cycle than that of Li+
 intercalation in principle. High energy 
density has been reported for perovskite anion-intercalation pseudocapacitor due to their high tap 
density and high concentration of intercalation sites (oxygen vacancies).[22-24] For example, the 
layered PrBaMn2O6-δ electrode exhibited an ultrahigh pseudocapacitance of 1034 F g-1 with an 
excellent stability in the anion intercalation type supercapacitor.[24]
Although the charge is stored in the electrode bulk, the capacity and rate capability of anionintercalation type supercapacitors is still strongly affected by the surface properties of the perovskite 
oxides in many cases.[20, 23, 25] The electrodes should have high activity towards the OHtransformation to O2- and H2O and high capability for the charge transfer across the interface to 
minimize the polarization loss across the surface. Our past studies have demonstrated that some 
perovskite oxides required a long activation period to reach the maximum capacitance, which could 
be as high as 4 times of the initial value.[20] Such improvement in capacity after activation was 
resulted from the selective dissolution of elements, which caused a significant enlargement in 
specific surface area, thus the surface process was greatly accelerated to reduce its impact on the 
energy storage at various charge/discharge rates. However, such substantial increase in capacitance 
(capacity) due to surface activation introduces big challenge to find a matchable counter electrode for 
practical application. In addition, the continuous selective dissolution of elements from perovskite

would inevitably cause a negative effect on the phase stability of the perovskite, which is a basis for 
the oxygen-anion intercalation. How to find a perovskite electrode with high and stable capacitance 
without the need of activation process is a big challenge. Since the energy density is closely related 
to the amount of insertable oxygen vacancy sites inside the oxide lattice, both the bulk and surface 
properties of a perovskite electrode should be optimized to reach the standards for practical 
application in supercapacitors.
Perovskite oxide lattice is reputed for its high flexibility. Recently it has been found that 
selective exsolution of the A-site or B-site cation(s) from the perovskite oxide lattice can appear 
while the perovskite structure is maintained by creating a change of oxygen partial pressure of 
surrounding atmosphere or introducing an electrochemical potential.[26-29] The exsoluted element(s) 
will form nanoparticles to decorate on the perovskite surface with significantly enhanced surface 
area and create strong interaction with the perovskite main phase. Furthermore, such nanoparticles 
may perform as catalysts for promoting various kinds of reactions, such as oxygen reduction reaction 
at high temperature, oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline solution, hydrogen and methane electrooxidation, and iodine reduction reaction in dye-sensitized solar cells.[30-33] On the other hand, the 
exsolution of selected cation from the perovskite lattice may cause a change in the oxygen vacancy 
concentration of the perovskite matrix, creating additional effect on the bulk properties of the 
perovskite phase.[34, 35]
In this study, we reported the development of a Co3O4/NiO nanoparticles modified perovskite 
composite as electrode for supercapacitor with dual energy storage mechanism, i.e., surface Faradaic 
redox pseudocapacitance and oxygen anion intercalation pseudocapacitance. The resulted electrode 
showed high power and energy density, no surface activation process, and stable performance. A 
method involving controlled exsolution of Ni and Co from perovskite oxide lattice was established 
for the synthesis of such composite electrode. Comprehensive characterization techniques were 
applied to understand the origin of the superior performance. As a universal strategy, it may also be

118_intro.txt.txt,"ithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and supercapacitors are the best known electrochemical energy 
storage (EES) devices for their high energy density (kW h kg−1) and power density (kW h−1), 
respectively. LIBs have found applications in our day-to-day electronic devices while supercapacitorbased trams and buses are being tested in a few countries [1]. The existing research progress on the 
materials chemistry of LIBs and supercapacitors are in focus to replace the fossil fuel-based internal 
combustion (IC) engine with plug-in/hybrid electric vehicles. Another important prospect is to store 
and provide electricity when it is needed inorder to minimize the transmission loss and maximize 
power utilizations. LIBs possess low self-discharge, high gravimetric and volumetric density (W h 
L−1), while a supercapacitor exhibits high charge-discharge rate, power density, and long cyclic 
performance of over 10,000 cycles [1–5]. TiO2 is considered as an alternative anode material that could potentially substitute 
commercialized graphite. Some of its merits are: higher Li insertion potential (~1.7 V vs. Li+/Li0), 
prohibiting lithium plating/dendrite growth (proven safety concern), fast lithium 
insertion/extraction, low volume change, being environmentally friendly, chemically stable, and 
having a low cost [6–8]. Additionally, it offers theoretical capacity of 332 mA h g−1 [9], but due to its 
poor electronic conductivity (~1 × 10−12 S cm−1 to 1 × 10−7 S cm−1) and low Li-ion diffusion (~1 × 10−15
cm2 s−1 to 1 × 10−9 cm2 s−1), the ability of TiO2 has affected the lithium-ion storage capacity, which 
possibly limits its practical use. Therefore, there is a need to develop nanostructures of TiO2 with 
short diffusion length for electronic and Li+ transport, increasing the contact area between electrode 
and electrolyte, and better accommodation of the strain during Li insertion/extraction [10,11]. TiO2
nanotubes achieved the above properties, especially, when directly grown from Ti metal foil by the 
electrochemical anodization technique and, furthermore, displayed an additional advantage such as 
additive free electrode [12]. However, recent research is driven to tailor the properties of TiO2
nanotubes to improve the electronic conductivity and ionic diffusion by making composites with 
carbon materials [13], metal oxides [14], and doping with nitrogen [15] to increase its electrochemical 
activity. 
Depending upon experimental conditions, nitrogen doping in TiO2 (N-TiO2) phases leads to 
different forms such as nitrogen substitution to oxygen atoms, or interstitial NO2-, or surface adsorbed 
N2, etc [16]. Some studies found that ammonia-treated TiO2 exhibits the occurrence of interstitial 
atoms and it form N-Ti-O [17]. Therefore, nitrogen substitution in TiO2 causes a reduction and as a 
result Ti3+ and oxygen vacancy are formed. This formation creates additional electrons in the structure 
and leads to the increase of electronic conductivity [18]. Recently, more studies were carried out on 
nitrogen-doped 1-D TiO2 nanostructures in wide range of potential applications especially in energy 
storages devices. Hyungku Han et al. [19], reported the performance of LIB with nitrated TiO2 hollow 
nanofibers, which had been prepared by the electrospinning method and demonstrated an excellent 
improvement in the rate capability and exhibited discharge capacity of 85 mA h g−1, which was nearly 
twice as that of 45 mA h g−1 (bare TiO2). Hydrothermally prepared N-TiO2 nanotubes/graphene 
composites presented the discharge capacity of 369 mA h g−1 at 0.1 Ag−1 as better performance in LIBs 
[20]. N-TiO2-B nanowires have been studied for LIB as anode materials and they exhibit enhanced 
electrochemical performance of 153 mA h g−1 at 20 C with a 76% capacity retention even after 1000 
cycles, which make them potential candidate in a high-power lithium battery [21]. However, it is 
valuable that TiO2 nanotubes prepared by electrochemical anodization technique have in particular 
shown additional advantages over other synthesis techniques, particularly, in energy storage devices. 
These include: (i) titanium itself acts as a current collector and, therefore, minimizes the resistance 
between the active materials and the current collector; and (ii) enables binder free and conducting 
agents free active materials. Due to these advantages, anodized TiO2 nanotubes can be effectively 
used as a Li-ion battery anode material. 
As the nitrogen-doped anodized TiO2 exhibits superior electrochemical performance, this work 
attempts to report on the comparative performances of rate capability, specific capacitance, cyclic 
stability, and specific capacity of TiO2 nanotubes and N-TiO2 nanotubes for both LIB and 
supercapacitor applications.

119_intro.txt.txt,"Nowadays, the rapid development of wearable electronics and smart 
devices provide the urgent requirement of flexible high-performance 
energy storage devices [1–3]. Supercapacitors possessing the superiorities of low cost, fast charging speed, high power density, long cycle life 
and environment-friendly have attracted great attention and considered 
to be the most potential energy storage systems. Typically, the development of supercapacitors with light weight, excellent mechanical 
flexibility and large power/energy density are necessary [4–6]. However, the relatively low energy density restricted the large-scale applications. Thus, it is urgent to develop flexible supercapacitors electrode 
materials with high energy density. According to the energy density 
formula E = 1/2CV2
, the energy density of supercapacitor device can 
increase by the superior specific capacitance (C) and the extended 
voltage window (V) [7–9]. Therefore, it is prospective to develop 
flexible asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) assembled by active materials 
with higher specific capacitance and enlarged the operation potential 
window to achieve higher energy density. 
MnO2 as a kind of semiconductor material with high theoretical 
capacitance, abundant resources, low price and non-toxic has considered to be a suitable choice in electrochemical energy storage electrode 
[10–12]. However, the comparatively low conductivity and the structure collapse in the charging and discharging process severely restrict 
the reaction kinetics and decay the electrochemical performance [13]. 
Consequently, many efforts have been devoted to construct heterostructure upon other architecture to prevent structure collapse or 
introduce defects (doping or vacancy) optimizing the electronic structure to improve the electrical conductivity. Zhang et al. developed P 
doped Ni(OH)2@MnO2 core–shell structure as cathode material and 
assembled the high performance asymmetric supercapacitors [14]. Deng 
et al. constructed Co3O4@MnO2-PPy hybrid nanostructure for high  performance flexible supercapacitors. In which the cooperated highcapacitive MnO2 with conductive PPy generated a strong molecular 
coupling at the molecular level and thus enormously improve the utilization efficiency of MnO2 and promote the electron transfer efficiency 
[15]. Gao et al. introduced oxygen vacancy into MnO2 nanorod arrays 
by annealing at H2 atmosphere, which effectively improved the conductivity and obtained the specific capacitance of 874.5F g− 1 at a current density of 0.25 A g− 1 [16]. Wang et al. modulated MnO2 nanosheets 
by substitutional doping and assembled it into high performance 
printable solid-state micro-supercapacitors [17]. As a result, the defects 
engineering was considered as an effective way to improve the conductivity and promote the electrochemical performance. 
In addition to the aforementioned cathode material structure and 
electric structure regulation, the assembled anode material is also 
important for the hybrid asymmetric supercapacitor systems [18]. In 
consequence, Zinc-ion hybrid supercapacitors (ZHS) was emerged as 
promising energy storage devices and drawn considerable attention 
recently [19]. That is mainly attributed to the inherent advantages of 
zinc, as relatively high theoretical capacity of 820 mAh g− 1
, a low redox 
potential versus the standard hydrogen electrode (-0.76 V), costeffectiveness and abundant resources [20,21]. In consequence, it is 
significant to construct heterostructure and optimize the electric structure simultaneously to develop effective cathode material and assemble 
with high-capacity anode material to establish high performance 
supercapacitors. 
In this work, we report an oxygen vacancy modulated Co9S8@MnO2 
core–shell heterostructure cathode electrode material with promotional 
electrochemical performance. The Co9S8 nanotube arrays were acted as 
supporting skeleton that can facilitate electronic transmission through 
the interface and provide a larger surface area for the deposition of 
MnO2. Oxygen vacancy engineering can improve the inherent conductivity of MnO2 and increase the electrochemical active area. It should be 
noted that the voltage window of as-prepared Co9S8@MnO2-60 electrode can be enlarged to 1.1 V, with a high areal capacitance of 3.7F 
cm− 2 and the assembled flexible all-solid asymmetric supercapacitors 
(AAS) can achieve a maximum voltage window of 2.4 V, which is far 
higher than most current electrode materials. Meanwhile, the high energy density of 92.14 Wh kg− 1 at a power density of 342.86 W kg− 1 is 
obtained. Furthermore, Zn-ion hybrid supercapacitor is also assembled 
with a high energy density of 198.857 Wh kg− 1
, which is about twice 
than that of AAS devices. So, it is a promising strategy to combine highenergy Zn anode with high-power supercapacitors cathode to develop 
the high-performance energy storage device."
120_intro.txt.txt,"Electrochemical supercapacitors (ECs), as one of the main auxiliary/ 
stand-by power supplies, has the ability to bridge the power-energy gap 
between rechargeable Li-ion batteries and conventional electrostatic 
capacitors in the field of electric vehicles and portable electronic products due to its higher power and energy delivery feature.[1–4] Transition metal oxides (TMOs, for instance RuO2,[5] NiO,[6] MnO2,[7–9] 
TiO2[10] and Co3O4[11]), which can generate Faradaic pseudocapacitance associated with surface or located close to surface reversible redox 
reactions, are widely utilized as ECs electrode materials. 
Among abundant transition metal oxides (TMOs), manganese dioxide (MnO2) have been extensively reported because of its high specific 
capacitance (ca. 1370F g− 1
), low-price and environmental compatibility. However, the poor electronic/ionic conductivity of single-phase 
MnO2 electrode materials (105
-106 S cm− 1
) seriously limits its rate 
capability and cycling stability.[12–14] To overcome the natural 
drawback, more and more efforts have shifted to design different 
nanostructures of manganese dioxide, including the morphology control 
of single-phase MnO2 (nanosheets,[15] nanowires,
[16] nanotubes,[17] 
nanorods,[18,19] nanospheres,[20] nanoflowers[21]) and the 
construction of MnO2 composites modified with high conductive materials (conductive polymer,[22] carbon fiber,[23] carbon nano-tube, 
[24] graphene,[14] activated carbon,[25] carbon aerogel[26]) in which 
graphene as a typical two-dimensional material is widely used to increase the electrical conductivity of MnO2 materials and to prevent its 
structural collapse during charging-discharging process.[14,25,27–29] 
Recently, Song et al[30] reported that MnO2 nanosheets with large 
pseudo-capacitance are deposited onto graphene substrates with high 
conductivity and large specific surface area. The prepared GO/MnO2 
electrode exhibited an excellent specific capacitance of 1061F g− 1 and 
retained 92% of its initial capacitance after 5000 cycles in 3 M KCl 
aqueous solution. Moreover, the fractionated and interconnected rGO/ 
β-MnO2 hybrid hydrogels [27] composing of the ultrathin β-MnO2 
nanosheets and high conductivity of two-dimensional graphene exhibits 
a superior specific capacitance of 362F g− 1 at a current density of 1.0 A 
g− 1
, excellent rate performance and cycle stability in 6 M KOH aqueous 
solution. He et al[28] reported that a flexible, lightweight and high 
conductive MnO2/3D graphene network electrode with high MnO2 
loading (92.9%) and large specific surface area (392 m2 g− 1
) display a 
high area capacitance of 1.42F cm− 2 and good energy density of 6.8 Wh 
kg− 1 at power density of 62 W kg− 1 in 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution.Although the capacitance and cycle behaviors of MnO2 composites 
electrodes can be improved due to the synergistic effect between MnO2 
electrode material with high pseudo-capacitance and a stable grapheme 
backbone with high conductive, the actual capacitances are still far 
lower than the theoretical value of 1370F g− 1 based on the Mn4+/Mn3+
redox. In addition, the collapse and dissolution of electrode structures 
caused by Jahn-Teller effect of trivalent manganese remains a challenge. 
Therefore, some fundamental scientific problems relating to the energy 
storage mechanism of manganese-based oxides materials should be 
further investigated. 
It is well known that the pseudocapacitive behaviors of manganesebased oxides materials associating to the intercalation/deintercalation 
of the metal cations (M+) or protons (H+) at electrode surface and bulk 
was widely accepted in the neutral electrolyte system as the following 
equation: 
(MnO2)surface or bulk + M+ + e− ↔ (MnOOM)surface or bulk (M : H, Li, Na, K)
(1) 
In acidic electrolyte, the excessive protons can dissolve and reduce 
Mn4+ from MnO2 bulk (MnOOH + 3H+ + e− →Mn2+ + 2H2O), resulting 
in a poor cycling stability. Moreover, the reduction and dissolution of 
tetravalent manganese is almost irreversible owing to the high oxidation 
overpotential from divalent manganese to tetravalent manganese. 
However, the explanation of the energy storage mechanism for 
manganese-based oxides materials in alkaline electrolyte system is 
controversial. For example, an electrochemical reaction hypothesis in 
alkaline electrolyte was proposed by some researchers as following: 
[29,31,32] 
6Mn(OH)2 + 5OH− ↔ 6MnO2⋅5H2O + 7H+ + 12e− (2) 
It is thinked that the almost insulative Mn(OH)2 layer can be formed 
on the surface of MnO2 electrode due to the presence of abundant hydroxide ions in electrolyte, severely restricting the reaction kinetics. Yan 
and co-worker[33] found that the charge storage mechanism of 2D ionintercalated manganese-based oxides in alkaline electrolyte reveal a 
battery-like feature related to hydroxide ions. Moreover, our group’s 
previous research work[34] demonstrated that manganese-based oxides 
shows an energy storage behavior of reversible phase transformation 
reaction (Mn3O4 ↔ α-MnO2) in alkaline electrolyte during the charging/ 
discharging process. According to the above different explanations, it is 
necessary to call attention in an in-depth understanding of the charge 
storage mechanism for manganese-based oxides in alkaline electrolyte 
system. 
Herein, to demonstrate the energy storage behavior of manganesebased oxides in alkaline electrolyte system, a stable MnOx@rGO microspheres electrode material was synthesized by a typical hydrothermal and electrostatic self-assembly method combined with thermal 
treatment. According to in-situ characterization techniques (Raman 
spectroscopy and electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance measurements) and the density functional theory (DFT) calculation, it found 
that the MnOx in core–shell nanostructure undergoes a reversible phase 
transformation reaction of Mn3O4 ↔ K-birnessite manganese oxides 
during charging/discharging. Furthermore, K-birnessite manganese oxides obtained by electrochemical oxidation in the process of charging 
mainly reveals the K+ intercalation pseudocapacitance behavior during 
discharging. With the increasing of K+ intercalation, the Mn-O bonds 
length near the potassium ion in [MnO6] octahedral structure becomes 
longer, and the long unstable Mn-O bonds tend to lose oxygen and create 
oxygen vacancies, which further transforms the layered structure into a 
stable spinel-type Mn3O4 phase. "
121_intro.txt.txt,"For the implementation and strengthening of the concept of
sustainable economic development, the ever-increasing energy demand has led people to conduct massive amounts of studies onto
storage and conversion technologies of sustainable and renewable clean energy [1, 2]. Along with the vigorous development of
portable and flexible electronic equipment, there is a rising need
for electrochemical storage devices, with high specific capacitance
and energy density, quick charge-discharge rate, long lifespan, and
ease of installation, which are being exploring far and wide [3-
5]. It is diverting to note that supercapacitors (SCs) with high
power density and long life have been implicated as a promising
electrochemical energy storage device [6-8]. Whereas, the further
widespread applications of supercapacitors are limited due mainly
to their low energy density [9, 10].
Extensive research studies have been devoted to TMOs as ideal
pseudocapacitive materials for supercapacitors to date owing to
their high theoretical specific capacitances, abundance in nature,
and low cost [11-13]. It is undeniable that traditional sole transition metal oxides especially cobalt and manganese compounds
have good pseudo capacitance characteristics in theory [14, 15].

However, with the increasing demand for the energy density of
supercapacitors, the unsatisfactory specific capacity of single-metal
transition metal oxides such as MnO2 [16] (108 F g−1) or Co3O4
[17] (201.3 F g−1) in actual application has become their unredeemable weaknesses [18-20]. Studies have shown that multiplex
metal oxides containing two metal cations have higher actual capacity than single transition metal oxides [21, 22]. Among them,
the binary cobalt-manganese base oxides including multiple metal
oxidation states are pseudocapacitive materials with great application potential due to their outstanding characteristics of combining the astronomically high theoretical capacity of Co3O4 with
the high-speed capacity of MnO2 [23, 24]. For example, Li et al.
[25] manufactured a MnCo2O4 nanowire array growing on the
nickel foam via a facile route of hydrothermal process, and the
mass specific capacity of synthesized material is 349.8 F g−1. Nevertheless, the low electrical conductivity and a large degree of volume changes during charge and discharge process may result in
their sluggish redox kinetics and poor cycle stability [26].
Until recently, several researches have revealed that surface engineering of transition metal oxides can effectively accelerate and
intensify reaction dynamic process, either by anion [27] (phosphate ion, fluoride ion, etc.) and cation doping [28] (copper, aluminum, tungsten, etc.) or by the design of oxygen vacancies, realizing the improvement of electrochemical performance.

into NiCo2O4 lattice was presented to increase the discharge capacity [29]. During the charge and discharge cycles, oxygen defects
significantly enhance the transfer of electron/ion, and then effectively promote the electrode from surface redox reaction to the
overall reaction pattern. Yao et al. [30] designed a conductive zinc
oxide scaffold with abundant oxygen vacancies to form a ZnO–CoO
heterostructure. The unique heterostructure with vacancy defects
and a highly conductive nitrogen doped carbon layer covering the
surface of polymetallic oxide nanoparticles enable the designed
ZnO–CoO@NC composite material to exhibit excellent electrochemical performance. In addition to the deficiency of oxygen, multiple recent studies have reported the effects of various atomic and
ionic doping on the electrochemical properties of materials [31].
For instance, Wei et al. [32] formulated a defective carbon-coupled
P-MnO2 composite materials based on the meso–stability of onedimensional Mn3O4 in electrochemical environment and the superfast phase reconstruction strategy induced by phosphorus. The
study found that the doping of P changes the surface chemical
properties and electronic structure of Mn3O4, introduces unsaturated sites, thus strengthening the dynamic process of electrode
material reaction. Through a simple sol-gel method, Mei and his
co-workers [33] successfully distributed uniform copper atoms in
Ni-Fe based catalysts and obtained NiFeCu hydroxides, which effectively solved the problem of uneven Cu aggregation easily and realized homogeneous doping. Additionally, a super-stable manganesedoped Co3O4 mesoporous nanometer needle synthesized by onestep hydrothermal reaction has been reported [17]. Electrochemical test results implicate that the doping of Mn heteroatoms can
enhance the electrochemical conductivity and discharge capacity
of original Co3O4 (668.4 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1
compared to the unadulterated Co3O4, which is 201.3 F g−1). Although these single oxygen vacancy defects or heteroatom doping
defects can regulate the electronic structure of electrode materials and change the oxidation state of cations and anions [34], and
these influences contribute significantly to the improvement of the
electrochemical properties of materials, surprisingly little attention
has been paid to the synergistic effect of oxygen vacancies and
P doping on improving the electrochemical performance of binary
cobalt-manganese TMOs and the interaction between the two defects [35] (intrinsic defects and extrinsic-impurity defects) [36].
In this contribution, a double-defect strategy for the construction of oxygen vacancy and P doping has been proposed
to enhance the surface electrochemical performance of cobaltmanganese oxides (Co2MnO4). By creating oxygen vacancy defects
in the Co2MnO4 lattice to generate more carriers in the material,
the dynamics of the active substance participating in the reaction
is enhanced. In addition, the synergistic effect of oxygen vacancy
and P doping not only improves the conductivity of the material
but also enriches the redox kinetics. The as-obtained P-Co2MnO4-x
electrode possesses a skyscraping specific capacity of 838 F g−1
at 1 A g−1. Furthermore, an asymmetric supercapacitor, assembled
with P-Co2MnO4-x as the positive electrode and activated carbon
(AC) as the negative electrode, exhibits a considerable energy density of 25.18 Wh kg−1 at a power energy of 800.07 W kg−1
, and
89.5% initial capacity retention rate after 5000 cycles."
122_intro.txt.txt,"Currently, the increasing environmental awareness and the
upgrading of the industrial structure are driving the transition
from traditional energy to new energy. Compared with the
conventional energy storage apparatus, supercapactiors (SCs)
have many outstanding features, such as high power density,
quick charge−discharge capability, long service life, and so
on.1−3 SCs are divided into double-layer capacitors (EDLCs)
and faradic pseudocapacitors.4 The core component of SCs is
an electrode material, and traditional electrode materials
include carbon, metal oxides, and conductive polymers.3,5−8
Although good electrochemical results have been achieved,
these electrode materials still have many flaws, such as
insufficient exposure of active sites and low specific
capacitance.9
Over the past decades, the exploitation of transition metal
sulfides as new electrode materials has increased significantly
due to their unique physicochemical properties including good
electronic conductivity, increased redox reaction sites, and high
electrochemical activity.10,11 Since the microstructure has a
pronounced influence on electrochemical performance, construction of various nanostructured electrode materials is a
powerful way of boosting electrochemical performance.12
However, it is tedious to synthesize metal sulfides with specific
structures by conventional template methods. Recently,
metal−organic frameworks (MOFs) with large surface areas,
tunable compositions, and spatial structures have been
conveniently utilized as precursors and templates to prepare
various metal sulfide nanostructures for electrochemical energy
storage.13−18 For instance, using zeolitic imidazole framework
(ZIF)-67 as a template, Jiang et al.13 reported CoS with a
porous nanocage structure and high specific capacitance (1475
F/g at 1 A/g). Yu et al.15 reported the synthesis of NiS
nanoframes formed by ion-exchange of the [Co(CN)6]2
3− of
Ni-Co PBAs with S2−. The NiS nanoframes exhibited high
activity toward SCs and electrocatalysis. Our group19
demonstrated a leaf-like Co9S8 nanosheet array derived from a 2D MOF template, which acted as a free-standing electrode
for SCs displaying good pseudocapacitive performance (954.5
F/g at 1 A/g). In spite of these progresses, the inherent slow
charge transfer kinetics and poor stability in alkaline solution
restrict the applications of metal sulfides.20 Therefore, it is
essential to combine metal sulfides with a secondary material
to overcome their intrinsic drawbacks.
Recently, CeO2 as a popular electrocatalytic material,21−23 is
also emerging in the field of SCs,24 not only because of the
rapid and reversible transition between Ce4+ and Ce3+ but also
because of the formation of oxygen vacancies in the lattice of
CeO2.
24 The oxygen vacancies can enhance oxygen supply,
improve electrical conductivity, and accelerate the transport of
electron/ions, thereby playing a vital role in the field of
electrocatalysis or SCs.24,25
Herein, we built an array of cobalt sulfide 2D nanoplates
wrapped by CeO2 nanoparticles (NPs), which was vertically
arranged on nickel foam. The cobalt sulfide nanoplate arrays
(Co3S4-NPAs) were made from 2D ZIFs through a simple
solution sulfidation, and the CeO2 NPs were uniformly
decorated on the surface of Co3S4 via a solvothermal synthesis.
Such 2D Co3S4/0D CeO2 nanostructure has not been reported
previously. The advantages of this novel Co3S4/CeO2-NPA
electrode are listed as follows: (i) Constructing electrode
materials directly on the conductive substrate can avoid the
extra resistance when using nonconductive polymer binders.19
(ii) The vertically aligned Co3S4 nanoplates can offer more
electroactive sites and can prevent the agglomeration of
electrode materials. (iii) The incorporation of CeO2 NPs
induces strong electronic coupling between Co3S4-NPAs and
CeO2 NPs and gives rise to a large amount of oxygen vacancies
on the surface of Co3S4, favoring electronic transmission and
charge transport.21,22,24−26 Moreover, the outer layer of CeO2
also protects Co3S4 from corrosion by the electrolyte.27
Consequently, the Co3S4/CeO2-NPAs exhibit high specific
capacity/capacitance, i.e., 1155.8 C/g (2408 F/g) at 0.5 A/g,
and the asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) using it as the
positive electrode demonstrates remarkable energy density

with distinct redox states and its electrochemically stable nature [3,4]. 
Ferrites (MFe2O4) are expected to produce richer redox reactions as both 
M and Fe ions can contribute for the reaction compared to that of single 
metal oxides [5]. Predominantly, MnFe2O4 has fascinated the active 
area of research due to its superparamagnetic nature with its potential 
application towards ultraviolet resistance, electromagnetic shielding, 
water purification with higher absorption rate, lower toxicity, better 
biocompatibility and cheaper compared to other ferrites [6,7] with high 
catalytic activity, highest magnetization and virtuous durability [8–10].

as an alternate energy stored for batteries because of its applications 
towards mobile electronic devices, memory backup system, etc., with 
simultaneous energy density and high power [11]. Especially, binary 
metal oxide ferrites with multiple oxidation state and excellent electrochemical properties with molecular formula (MFe2O4) makes them 
suitable for supercapacitor applications. Hence, it is meaningful to 
investigate the suitable metal ferrite, in this case, MnFe2O4 in the 
challenging field of supercapacitor. MnFe2O4 thin films were studied for 
its supercapacitive behaviour in KOH electrolyte by Zate et al. [12]. 
Further, Aparna et al. analysed the supercapacitive behaviour of metal 
ferrite (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Mn, Cu, Zn) electrodes and found that MnFe2O4 
shows comparatively good supercapacitive behaviour [13]. 
In addition to supercapacitor applications, MnFe2O4 can also shows 
highly sensitive electrochemical behaviour. Spinel ferrites have attracted researchers towards multifaceted application ranging from environmental to point-of-care applications with development in the field of 
electrochemical sensors depending on the nature of M2+ cation in 
MFe2O4 [14,15]. Even though many techniques are available with advantages such as good sensitivity and low detection limits [16,17] to 
sense the analyte, it fails in its long treatment procedures with high cost 
implications. Instead, electrochemical techniques with merits such as 
cost effectiveness, simplicity, rapid response, high selectivity and 
sensitivity was used to detect the analyte such as Paracetamol and 
D-Glucose traces in the electrolyte. Various literatures were reported for 
MnFe2O4 by many researchers using different methods for sensing 
glucose, nitrite and Flunitrazepam under various conditions [18–20]. 
Moreover, as per the literature survey, MnFe2O4 was synthesized by 
various methods such as traditional ceramic methods, thermal decomposition, sol–gel oxalate method, mechanical ball milling, chemical coprecipitation, hydrothermal and micro emulsion method [21–23]. In 
spite of above-mentioned methods, in our work, MnFe2O4 was synthesized by combustion synthesis considering its rapid nature, easy equipment, low reaction time and molecular level of mixing. In this method, 
high process temperature is always self-sustained with exothermicity 
that governs the crystalline size, crystallinity and the extent of 
agglomeration [24]. Besides all these, MnFe2O4 provides an advantage 
for repeating magnetic separation with good stability to degrade the 
waste water [25–32]. Recently, surface oxygen vacancies rich BiFeO3 
nanocrystal was synthesized by high pressure hydrogenation process by 
Huang et al., [33]. It was stated that the introduction of surface oxygen 
vacancies in BiFeO3 resulted in decrease of band gap that in turn enabled 
photogenerated electron-hole pair separation easily. CoFe2O4 synthesized by co-precipitation method explains about the presence of oxygen 
vacancies within the sample that was responsible for superior photocatalytic activity [34]. 
Here, a systematic study was carried out for facile combustion synthesized MnFe2O4 by altering the reaction temperature from 250 to 
500 ◦C by adding ODH as fuel. The effect of temperature that influences 
the crystallinity, crystalline size and optical band gap was discussed. The 
synthesized NPs can act as a promising and cheap alternate for supercapacitor electrode with well-constructed morphology. The excellent 
performance of MnFe2O4 resembles from different morphology, high 
crystallinity, surface oxygen vacancies, better redox reaction and 
excellent photocatalytic activity. The efficient role played by the introduction of surface oxygen vacancies due to increase in temperature with 
that lead to change in the morphology and photocatalytic activity was 
discussed in detail. MnFe2O4 synthesized at 500 ◦C can act as very good 
electrode material for supercapacitor applications with high specific 
capacitance, remarkable electrochemical stability, sensitive electrochemical behaviour of Paracetamol and D-Glucose at lower concentration with enhanced photocatalytic activity towards decolourization of 
organic pollutants, Methylene Blue and Alizarin Red S towards environmental remediation"
124_intro.txt.txt,"exible energy storage devices with high volumetric capacitances/capacities and high energy densities are in high demand for
portable and wearable electronics increases [1-3]. Supercapacitors
are an excellent choice due to the high power densities, long cycling lifes and safety [4,5]. There are two main classifications based
on the energy storage mode in supercapacitors: one is electrochemical double-layer capacitors, EDLC, that occurs via physisorption of ions on the surface of electrodes, mainly carbon-based
materials, with ultra-high power densities but low volumetric capacitances (Cv) and low volumetric energy densities (Ev). The second is charge storage via fast surface or near-surface redox reactions, in which case Cv and high Ev are higher but the power
densities are lower. Molybdenum trioxide, MoO3, has attracted
tremendous interest because of its pseudocapacitive characteristics, its high theoretical capacitance, high electrochemical activity
and rapid ion (de)intercalation [6–8]. However, the low electronic
conductivity of MoO3 restricts charge transfer and slows down the
reaction kinetics.

In general, introducing oxygen vacancies (VO) in MoO3, to
form MoO3-x, improves its electrical conductivity and increases the
density of active sites, leading to better electrochemical performance. For example, Yang et al. fabricated three-dimensional, 3D,
graphene nanomesh-carbon nanotube/MoO3-x nanocomposite electrodes with a high volumetric capacitance of 692 C cm−3 in 1 M
Na2SO4 [9]. Wu et al. prepared ultrathin, narrow MoO3-x nanobelts,
with a large concentration of VO, that were characterized by excellent electrochemical performance and fast reaction kinetics in
H2SO4/ethylene glycol electrolytes [10]. Yu et al. demonstrated that
when water molecules replace lattice oxygen sites in MoO3, the
specific capacities approach theoretical, viz. 963 C g−1 at 0.1 mV
s−1 in organic electrolytes [11]. Kim et al. showed that with the
introduction of VO, the interlayer spacing increases which in turn
increased the density of redox-active sites and fast charge storage
kinetics in organic electrolytes [12]. Zhang et al. prepared oxygendeficient MoO3-x by H2 plasma etching that led to LIB cathodes
with high Li-ion diffusivities, low charge transfer resistances and
polarizations [13]. In all cases, the enhanced properties were attributed to the enhanced electronic conductivities. Nevertheless, at
10−4~10−6 S cm−1 the conductivity of reduced MoO3-x is still low
[9,14], though higher than MoO3 (~10−7 S cm−1) [9].
Another factor that tends to lower the Cv of MoO3-x electrodes
is the need to add binders and conductive agents that do not
contribute to the capacitances. Designing free-standing films with out additives is needless to say advantageous. Yu et al. designed
rGO/MoO3-x films with gravimetric and areal specific capacitances
in 1 M H2SO4 (8371 mF cm−2 and 540 C g−1 at 1 A g−1 respectively) [15]. Xiao et al. fabricated freestanding MoO3-x/CNTs films
with Cv of 291 F cm−3 and excellent rate capability [16]. However,
the introduction of the rGO and CNTs that are EDLC materials, reduced the Cv values to < 300 F cm−3 [17] and limited the Ev values.
Recently a new class of two-dimensional, 2D, transition metal
carbides, nitrides, or carbonitrides, labeled MXenes have been
discovered [18–20]. The general formula of these materials is
Mn+1XnTz, in which M is an early transition metal such as Ti, V,
Mo et al., X is C and/or N, n is 1–4 and Tz represents surface terminations such as -F, -O, -OH, -Cl, etc. Some MXene possess metallike electrical conductivities and are hydrophilic. This combination
of properties has resulted in some of the highest Cv supercapacitor values reported to date [21]. Among the more than 30+ MXene
known to exist, Ti3C2Tz films - synthesized by chemical etching the
Al layer from a Ti3AlC2 precursor and - have shown conductivities
in the range of 4000–15,000 S cm−1 [18,22–24].
In our previous work [25], we demonstrated that when Ti3C2Tz
and MoO3 suspensions were cast into films, and used as electrodes
in a 3 M H2SO4 electrolyte, the electrochemical performance was
excellent. For example, a MoO3/d-Ti3C2 film with a 80:20 mass ratio, stored 837 C g−1 (1836 C cm−3) at 1 A g−1 with a mass loading
≈ 2 mg cm−2. (Henceforth for the sake of brevity, the Tz designation is dropped). When the mass loading was increased to a commercial level (>10 mg cm−2), these composite films still stored 767
C g−1 (1664 C cm−3) at 1 A g−1.
Our major aim in this work was to increase the energy and
power densities of our electrodes/devices. To that effect we reduced the MoO3 prior to mixing it with d-Ti3C2 and used 5 M LiCl
as the electrolyte that increase the voltage window to ≈ 2.1 V. We
also tested asymmetric supercapacitors where one electrode was
a mixture of MoO3-x and d-Ti3C2 - henceforth referred to as MT
- the other was a nitrogen-doped activated carbon, NAC, film. We
also used glassy carbon as current collectors, to suppress the water
splitting process [26,27]"
125_intro.txt.txt,"The excessive use of fossil energy and the increased awareness of environmental 
protection have promoted the rapid development of clean and renewable energy storage 
systems to improve the energy utilization efficiency. For the past couple of years, 
electrochemical supercapacitors (SCs), as a new charge storage device between 
traditional capacitors and batteries, have received more and more attention because of 
their higher specific capacity, excellent power density, long cycle-life and fast chargedischarge rate 1-3. According to the energy storage mechanisms, supercapacitors can be 
divided into three types, including electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs), pseudocapacitors and hybrid capacitors 4
. Among them, due to the rapid and reversible redox 
reaction or the insertion/extraction of electrolyte ions, pseudo-capacitors have higher 
capacity and wider application prospects 5
. The type of electrode materials plays an 
important role in the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors. For pseudocapacitors, transition metal oxides, such as ruthenium oxide (RuO2) 6
, manganese 
dioxide (MnO2) 7-9 and iron oxide (Fe2O3) 10-12, are studied extensively as active 
materials due to their greater charge storage capacity.
MnO2, characterized by low-cost, cheap, available in abundance, non-toxic and 
environmentally friendly, is mostly studied as an active material for supercapacitors 13
. 
Furthermore, the high theoretical specific capacitance of 1370 F g-1 also paves the way 
for its extensive applications 14. It is worth noting that the electrochemical performance 
of MnO2 is closely related to its crystal structure. There are five different 
crystallographic structures for manganese dioxide, including -, -, -, - and - 𝛼 𝛽 𝛿 𝜆 𝛾
MnO2, which are all interlinked by MnO6 octahedrons in different ways 13, 15, 16. Among 
them, -, - and -MnO 𝛼 𝛽 𝛾 2 have 1D tunnel structures (2 2 octahedral units for - × 𝛼
MnO2, 1 1 octahedral units for -MnO × 𝛽 2 and 1 2 octahedral units for -MnO × 𝛾 2), - 𝛿
MnO2 has a relatively open 2D layered structure and -MnO 𝜆 2 is a 3D spinel structure 
15, 17. Obviously, crystal structures with sufficient gaps are easy to fully contact with 
electrolyte ions, which are expected to be used in the field of energy storage. In addition, 
these crystallographic structures of MnO2 can also cause significant changes in 
electronic and ionic conductivity, thereby affecting the pseudo-capacitance behavior of the material 17. For -MnO 𝛾 2 and -MnO 𝜆 2 electrode materials, the specific capacitances 
are only 20~30 F g-1 13, 18, 19. Therefore, this work mainly analyzes the electrochemical 
characteristics of -, -, and -MnO 𝛿 𝛽 𝛼 2 electrode materials for supercapacitors.
In general, most efforts are focused on the fabrication of positive electrode 
materials, and the great improvement has been achieved. In contrast, the advancement 
of new negative electrode materials has progressed relatively slowly 20. Although many 
materials have been studied as promising candidates for the negative electrode of 
supercapacitors, the development of negative electrode materials has been limited to 
carbon, a few transition metal oxides and individual nitrides 21-25. At present, most of 
the negative electrodes of supercapacitors are made of carbon materials such as the 
most common activated carbon 7, 26-28. However, due to relatively low specific 
capacitance (usually less than 300 F g-1), carbon-based negative electrode materials 
cannot meet the rapid development of high-performance supercapacitors. Therefore, 
the development of negative materials with high electrochemical performance is 
considered to be crucial in the supercapacitors with high energy density 29. Zheng et al. 
30 synthesized the 3D cobalt phosphide (CoP) nanowire arrays on carbon cloth by 
hydrothermal method and post-low temperature phosphating, which as the negative 
electrode exhibited a capacitance of 571.3 mF cm-2 at 1 mA cm-2. Feng et al. 31 reported 
that amorphous porous Mn3O4/NGP fabricated via electrodeposition as a negative 
electrode material showed a capacitance of 432 F g-1 at 5 mV s-1. In addition, some 
Fe3O4-based materials have been used as negative electrode for supercapacitors and 
have exhibited excellent performance 23, 32, 33
.
However, there are relatively few special reports about the application potential of 
MnO2 as a negative electrode material for supercapacitors. Especially regarding its 
energy storage mechanism, there is also a lack of relevant research. For instance, Wang 
et al. 32 found that the performance of Fe3O4/CNTs coated with MnO2 has been greatly 
improved, but the role of MnO2 in the negative electrode region has not been 
emphasized and explained. Zhou et al 34. found that there were two pairs of redox peaks 
in the negative potential range when MnO2/PCNFs was used as anode material of 
supercapacitor, but the specific energy storage process has not been studied. Tian et al 
35. prepared MnO2 film directly grown on Ni foam by chemical bath method, which  showed excellent energy storage effect in alkaline solution under negative potential, 
but the reaction of MnO2 in KOH was explained by citing the proton electron 
mechanism in acidic solution. Deng et al. also found that WFCF/MnO2
36 had a good 
energy storage effect when applied to the negative electrode of supercapacitors, but its 
energy storage principle was considered to be the same as MnO2 as the positive 
electrode: the adsorption/desorption and insertion/intercalation of metal cations. 
Therefore, it is particularly important to study the true energy storage mechanism of 
MnO2 as a negative electrode material.
In this work, we aimed to study the electrochemical performance and energy 
storage mechanism of pure MnO2 as the negative electrode materials of supercapacitors 
in alkaline solution. Three different crystallographic structures including -MnO 𝛿 2
nanoflowers, -MnO 𝛽 2 nanopillars and -MnO 𝛼 2 nanospheres were prepared by 
hydrothermal, hydrothermal followed by annealing process and chemical coprecipitation, respectively. After annealing at 300 , the oxygen vacancy-enhanced - ℃ 𝛼
MnO2 exhibits a high specific capacitance of 736.3 F g-1 and excellent conductivity. 
Hydroxide ion dependence experiments confirmed that the MnO2 negative electrode 
shows a different energy storage process from the positive electrode, which relies on 
the presence of OH-
 instead of metal cations. Theoretical quantitative kinetic studies 
reveal that the unusual redox peak is mainly a process dominated by capacitance control. 
Moreover, the assembled M-300//H-NiCo2O4 asymmetric supercapacitor possesses a 
high energy density of 34.9 Wh kg-1 at the power density of 550 W kg-1, showing its 
feasibility in practice."
126_intro.txt.txt,"The continuous consumption of fossil fuels and their corresponding environmental 
pollution and climate change require the development of green and sustainable energy 
sources [1,2]. In the last few years, electrochemical energy storage devices (ESDs) such 
as supercapacitors (SCs) and lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have become research 
hotspots in the field of energy storage in portable electronic devices, electric vehicles, 
and large power grids due to their good performance and huge price potential. LIBs 
and SCs are two types of electrochemical ESDs. Although both depend on
electrochemical processes, the charge storage mechanism is completely different, 
which also leads to advantages in energy and power density. Among them, the battery 
material stores a high energy density (~200 Wh kg-1
) through a diffusion-restricted 
redox reaction, which results in tardy charging (hour level) and lower power density.
In contrast, capacitive materials do not involve Faraday charge storage, which stores 
charges only through surface-controlled ion adsorption and desorption. This capacitive 
charge storage mechanism produces high power and can store less energy (~5 Wh kg1
) quickly (in seconds) [3,4]. Thus, in order to achieve the high energy density (ED) of 
LIBs and the high power density (PD) of SCs simultaneously, a very promising new 
type of energy storage hybrid device lithium-ion capacitors (LICs) came out [5].
However, in LICs, the kinetics of the battery-type negative electrode with the 
intercalation mechanism is much slower than that of the capacitive-type positive 
electrode with the electric double-layer mechanism, which results in a lower power 
density of the LICs compared to the conventional electric double layer capacitors 
(EDLCs). For this reason, the pseudo- capacitive material stores charge through a redox 
reaction similar to that of a battery, and its occurrence rate is comparable to the reaction 
rate of an electric double layer in a capacitive material. As a result, materials that 
combine these characteristics can obtain faster-charged electrochemical ESDs and can 
provide high power [4,6]. So far, the anode materials that have been used as LICs 
mainly fall into three categories: “embedded”, “conversion reaction”, and “alloyed”.
Unfortunately, currently synthesized single-phase anode materials still suffer from poor 
electronic conductivity, low pseudo-capacitance contribution, and sharp volume 
expansion effects [7].
Transition metal-based sulfide electrode materials with abundant reserves and 
multi-electron reaction characteristics are considered to be potential representatives of 
excellent LIBs anode materials [8]. Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is a typical twodimensional material with a unique two-dimensional layered structure that can support 
multiple Li+
. Furthermore, the weak van der Waals interaction between the MoS2 layers 
can promote reversible ion de-intercalation, making MoS2 have supernal theoretical 
specific capacity and excellent rate capability [9–12]. However, the application of 
excellent molybdenum-based sulfides in lithium-ion hybrid capacitor anodes is 
relatively rare. The main cause is that the conductivity of molybdenum sulfide is low, 
and the pseudocapacitive effect of single phase is not obvious, large volume change and 
low utilization of active materials lead to poor cycle stability and rate performance. To 
solve the above problem, an effective strategy is to reduce the particle size to nanometer 
size, which can shorten the diffusion length of lithium ions and enlarge the contact area 
between the electrolyte and the electrode. Another strategy is to compound MoS2 with 
a conductive elastic matrix, such as amorphous carbon, carbon nanotubes, graphene, 
conductive polymers etc. to improve conductivity while buffering volume changes [13–
15]. Based on the combination of the above two methods, the formation of 
heterogeneous nanocomposites with good interface contact and synergistic effect is 
more effective for improving the electrochemical performance of MoS2. This can not 
only improve the ion/electron transport properties, but also improve the structural 
stability. For example, Qian et al. reported that several layers of MoS2 nanoplates were 
anchored on bowl-shaped mesoporous carbon nanoparticles to form BMCNs@MoS2 
anode materials by a nitrogen-containing polymer-induced interface growth strategy 
method [16]. Zhang et al. synthesized a MoS2 nanocluster epitaxially grown on a CNT 
skeleton by a simple chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method, and then prepared a 
CNT@MoS2@C composite material by carbon coating treatment [13]. Chen et al. 
synthesized a multilayer N-doped graphene/MoS2/N-doped graphene composite (NDG 
/MoS2/NDG) with a simple and low-cost thermal decomposition-reduction method [10].
Wu et al. prepared a polypyrrole-derived carbon nanotube@MoS2@carbon (PCN@ 
MoS2@C) sandwich structure by a simple hydrothermal method [17]. Professor Yury 
Gogotsi’s group generated MoS2/Mo2TiC2Tx composites on Mo2TiC2Tx by in-situ 
vulcanization [18]. The heterogeneous composites synthesized by structural 
modification of their MoS2 through different coating concepts described above all 
exhibit high stability and ultra-fast lithium storage. However, the methods for preparing 
the composite materials are complicated and cumbersome, and the carbon source used 
is expensive. Therefore, the novel electrode structures with simple preparation methods, 
low carbon source precursors, suitable for mass production, and improved cycle life 
and rate performance of MoS2 by simple design methods are still the current research 
hotspots.
In this regard, we reported that a nano-hybrid MoS2 and its carbon-coated 
composite material (MoS2@C) were obtained by a one-pot hydrothermal method and a 
post-assisted vulcanization strategy. Among them, MoS2 material is composed of nano 
-flakes and nano-hollow spheres self-assembled by nanoparticles. The nanoparticles
self-assembled hollow sphere structure results in a hybrid structure formed between 
MoS2 and a carbon material, which can prevent the accumulation and agglomeration of 
MoS2, and can also provide more active sites for lithium insertion. At the same time, it 
is beneficial to improve the conductivity and the kinetics of lithium ion transport of 
MoS2, and can suppress the volume expansion of MoS2 during charging and discharging.
As a result, the cycle stability and rate performance of the molybdenum-based sulfide 
electrode material are greatly improved. When used as a negative electrode material 
for LIB, the MoS2@C hybrid electrode material was applied to half-cells and 
maintained an outstanding reversible capacity of 433.6 mAh g-1
after 800 cycles at 0.5 
A g-1
(The capacity decay rate per circle from circle 2 to 800 is 0.347%). Furthermore, 
we designed MoS2@C as the negative electrode, commercial activated carbon (AC) as 
the positive electrode, and combined the reasonable matching of the working potential 
between the anode and cathode electrodes to successfully assemble hybrid lithium ion 
capacitors (MoS2@C//AC LIC). The finally realized LIC system can work in the 
voltage range of 0-4.5 V, and at the same time brings a superhigh specific energy 
(189.68 Wh kg-1
), ultra-high PD (11250 W kg-1
), and outstanding cycling stability 
(Specific capacity remains at 72.12% after 3000 cycles). The material selection, 
synthesis, and electrode matching strategies involved in this paper have great reference 
value for further research on LIC"
127_intro.txt.txt,"In order to meet the growing demand for portable and flexible electronics such as 
mobile phones, wearable devices and roll-up displays, the rising flexible solid-state 
supercapacitors have attracted enormous attention in recent years [1,2]. The energy 
density of flexible solid-state supercapacitors is mainly limited by electric double 
layer capacitance (EDLC) and pseudocapacitance strongly depended on 
ion-accessible specific surface area (SSA) and fast faradaic reactions respectively [1], 
remaining as an intractable bottleneck for commercial application until flexible 
solid-state battery-supercapacitor hybrid (BSH) devices emerge [3]. The BSH devices 
as an important class of asymmetric supercapacitors, are typically constructed by a 
high-capacity battery-type electrode such as LiCoO2 [4], LiMn2O4 [5], Bi2O3 [6,7], 
Fe3O4 [8], BiFeO3 [9], Bi2MoO6 [10], and a high-rate capacitive electrode such as 
3
carbon nanomaterials [11-13], conducting polymers [13,14], Nb2O5 [15], MoS2 [16], 
MXenes [17], LaMnO3 [18], holding great promise as high-efficient energy storage 
devices for potential applications in future electric vehicles, smart electric grids, 
flexible and wearable electronics [1]. Compared with ordinary supercapacitors based 
on EDLC or pseudocapacitance, BSH devices can easily provide a higher energy 
density through structural optimization and reasonable configuration of anodes and 
cathodes, mainly relying on the intercalation/de-intercalation of electrolyte ions for 
strong faradaic redox reactions in battery-type electrodes [19]. 
First synthesized in the late 1950s, perovskite bismuth ferrite (BiFeO3) with 
remarkable ferroelectric, magnetic and optical properties, has been widely applied for 
multifunctional devices in electronics, spintronics, piezotronics and photonics [20]. 
BiFeO3 can be routinely fabricated through electrodeposition technique [21], sol-gel 
method [22] and hydrothermal reaction [23], resulting in the rhombohedral structure 
(in R3c space group) accompanied with multiple crystallite phases such as Bi2Fe4O9, 
Bi3Fe5O12, Bi4Fe2O9 and Bi46Fe2O72, which can also provide capacity as BiFeO3
through phase transformations during the charge/discharge process [21]. The reported 
Bi2O3 anodes have exhibited the cathodic peak potentials (-1.4 V), much more 
negative than the hydrogen evolution potential (-0.6 V vs. SCE) in aqueous 
electrolytes, attributed to the reversible redox reaction of Bi3+ regarded as 
“quasi-conversion reaction” (Bi2O3 ↔ Bi0
) [6]. The extended operating voltage 
window can effectively boost the energy density of BSH devices, confirmed by the 
computational formula: E=1/2CΔV2
, where E, C and ΔV represent energy density, 
4
capacitance and voltage window respectively. Compared with Bi2O3 and Fe2O3, 
BiFeO3-based BSH devices have been previously reported to provide relatively low 
specific capacitance (< 163 F g-1 at 0.1 A g-1), narrow operating voltage window (< 
1.3 V) and bad cyclic stability (< 3000 cycles), probably attributed to irreversible 
phase transformations of BiFeO3 during the charge/discharge process, which depends 
on typical faradaic redox reactions of Bi3+ and Fe3+ mainly limited by solid-state 
diffusion of electrolyte ions in crystalline BiFeO3 frameworks [21-23]. Especially 
when conducted by consecutive charge/discharge tests in alkaline electrolyte (such as 
KOH), perovskite BiFeO3 reveals irreversible phase decomposition due to Bi3+ ion 
extraction from the A site in the initial 500 cycles, leading to the formation of Bi2O3
and residual Bi-deficient BiFeO3 [9]. 
Compared with battery-type BiFeO3 storing charges through strong faradaic 
redox, mesoporous orthorhombic Nb2O5 nanocrystal films have been reported to offer 
two-dimensional transport pathways for fast solid-state diffusion of Li+
, resulting in 
Li+
 intercalation pseudocapacitance for high-rate energy storage [15]. In addition, 
LaMnO3 as one of perovskite-type oxides, has shown the unique structural stability of 
the cation arrays accompanied with mobile oxygen ions under electrical polarization, 
accounting for the anion-based intercalation pseudocapacitance mechanism [18]. As 
such, it is really a huge challenge to develop an effective approach to improving the 
charge storage kinetics of BiFeO3 through the cation/anion-based intercalation 
pseudocapacitance mechanism, probably due to its structural instability in the 
charge/discharge process [9]. To solve this, a facile strategy of carbon shell protection 
5
has been reported to improve the cyclic stability and rate performance of Fe3O4
anodes [8]. However, this carbon shell obtained by the carbonization of glucose 
precursor, is inevitably accompanied by the formation of oxygen vacancies in the 
calcination process with nitrogen protection. Oxygen vacancies in metallic oxide have 
been previously demonstrated to not only play an important role in the enhancement 
of electronic conductivity [24-26], but also serve as the active sites for improving the 
anion-based intercalation pseudocapacitance [18]. These effects of oxygen vacancies 
introduced by the carbonization of precursors, tend to be neglected in the study of the 
carbon-stabilized metallic oxide for electrochemical energy storage.
Herein, we propose facile approaches to oxygen-deficient BiFeO3 nanoflakes 
stabilized by N-doped carbon (BiFeO3-NC) and N/S/P-codoped carbon nanosheet 
foams (N/S/P-CNSFs), used as anodes and cathodes for flexible BSH devices. The 
oxygen-deficient BiFeO3 nanoflakes are electrochemically deposited on the surface of 
graphite fibers (GFs), subsequently immersed into dilute aqueous solution of 
melamine and transferred into in a tube furnace for calcination, resulting in the 
BiFeO3-NC anode. The N-doped carbon shell as an outer layer of the BiFeO3-NC 
nanoflakes, can evidently enhance the specific capacity, rate capability and cycling 
stability. The N/S/P-CNSF cathode is obtained by the carbonization of the egg 
white/melamine composite foam precursor, and exhibits typical pseudocapacitance 
characteristics, due to N, S and P doping derived from melamine and egg white. 
Based on the GF@BiFeO3-NC anode and the N/S/P-CNSF cathode, flexible BSH 
devices with different mass loadings are assembled in a two-electrode configuration 
6
and manifested to deliver excellent supercapacitive performances, such as high 
operating voltage and ultra-long stability.

129_intro.txt.txt,"Electrochemical capacitors (ECs), also called supercapacitors or
ultracapacitors, are regarded as promising power sources for
hybrid electric vehicles and portable electronic devices due to their
long cycle life and great power densities [1–6]. In general, based on
their charging mechanisms, ECs fall into two categories, electrochemical double layer capacitor (EDLC) and pseudocapacitors.
The former is based on the separation of charges at the interface
between the electrode and electrolyte. The latter utilizes the fast
faradic process involving reversible redox reactions [3].
Over the past decade, numerous substances have been explored
as possible supercapacitor electrode materials such as carboneous
materials [7], conducting polymers [8], hybrid composites and
transition metal oxides [9]. In recent years, more attention has
been devoted to synthesis of nanoporous materials. Many investigations have demonstrated that the hierarchical structures with
highly porous characteristics may improve the performances of

material for supercapacitors because of its low cost, natural
abundance, high chemical stability and environmental friendliness
[21–23]. In general, TiO2 contributes a very low non-faradic capacitance (10–40 lF cm2
) in the charge–discharge process [24–26]. It
is widely believed that the low electrochemical capacitance results
from the low specific surface area and high electric resistance of
TiO2. Various synthetic strategies [27–33] have been probed to
improve the electrochemical capacitance of TiO2. Ramadoss et al.
[27] prepared vertically aligned TiO2 nanorod arrays on fluorine
doped tin oxide substrate using a hydrothermal method, and
the as-prepared electrode exhibited a maximum specific capacitance of 85 lF cm2 at a scan rate of 5 mV s1 and a capacitance
retention ratio of 80% after 1000 cycles. Salari et al. [28,33] found
that the specific capacitance value (911 lF cm2
) of the TiO2 nanotube array heat-treated under argon atmosphere was much higher
than that (30 lF cm2
) of the corresponding TiO2 sample heattreated under air atmosphere. Recently, it was demonstrated that
the donor densities and electrochemical activity of TiO2 nanostructures can be significantly improved by the thermal treatment hydrogen atmosphere [34–36]. Although the above investigations
have been conducted, the controllable fabrication of 3D nanoporous TiO2 films with prominent electrochemical capacitance properties still remains a great challenge.
In this investigation, we report a novel strategy for the fabrication of a 3D nanoporous hydrogenated TiO2 network film on titanium substrate, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Attractively, it is found
that the 3D nanoporous network consists of thin TiO2 nanotubes.
The fabrication mainly includes dealloying, alkali reflux and
annealing in hydrogen-containing atmosphere (hydrogenation). It
is demonstrated that the as-prepared 3D nanoporous TiO2 network
film exhibits large specific capacitance, excellent rate capability
and high electrochemical-cycling stability. The reasons that the
3D nanoporous TiO2 network film shows prominent electrochemical capacitance performance are discussed in detail."
130_intro.txt.txt,"Efficient and eco-friendly energy harvesting and storage 
devices have garnered a tremendous amount of attention due 
to the depletion of fossil fuels and drastic deterioration of the 
environment [1–3]. As an energy storage device, a supercapacitor 
also known as ultracapacitor provides high power density, 
excellent cycling durability, and wide operating temperature 
range, it is considered to be a promising technology for the nextgeneration energy storage [4, 5]. In general, supercapacitor can 
be typically categorized into electric double-layer capacitor 
(EDLCs) and pseudocapacitor, which store energy by electrostatic 
accumulation and reversible Faraday redox reaction, respectively 
[6, 7]. Although great progress has been achieved in the past 
few decades, low energy density remains a concern in future 
applications [8, 9]. The overall properties of supercapacitors 
are governed by electrodes, separators, and electrolytes, but the 
electrode is a critical factor that determines the performance 
of supercapacitors [10]. Therefore, designing novel electrode 
materials through material engineering that can meet the 
requirements of supercapacitors and sustainable energy 
development is a challenge. In recent years, researchers have 
focused on studying transition metal oxides due to their strong 
electrochemical activities and rich redox reactions [11]. 
Among various transition metal oxides, zinc oxide (ZnO), a 
semiconductor material with piezoelectric properties, good 
photoelectric chemical activity, and mechanical stability, has 
been widely applied in sensors, electronics, and photocatalysts 
[12, 13]. Additionally, ZnO has become a prospective electrode 
material for supercapacitors because of its high specific energy 
density, good electrochemical activity, low cost, and non-toxicity 
[14]. However, pure ZnO shows slow Faraday redox kinetics 
and low electrical conductivity, which lead to poor capacitance 
and cycling stability of the electrode during rapid charging 
and discharging process [10]. Various strategies have been 
implemented to develop electrode materials with rapid charge 
transfer ability and long cyclic life. In general, coupling ZnO 
with carbon materials (such as activated carbon, graphene, and 
carbon nanotubes) and transition oxides with high specific 
capacitance was used as electrode materials. NiO is a promising 
battery-type material due to its high theoretical specific 
capacitance [15–17], and it is logical to improve the properties 
of electrode materials by doping NiO. In such carbon 
nanostructure-metal oxide composite electrodes, a synergistic 
effect could be expected and the materials cost can be reduced 
[18]. The deliberately incorporating defects into the lattice 
structure of host materials is considered as a new “intrinsic” 
strategy to increase electrical conductivity [19]. Recent investigations demonstrate that deficient transition metal oxides, 
such as ZnO, Co3O4, TiO2, MnO2, and V2O5, with high donor 
density can improve intrinsic conductivity and promote 
pseudocapacitive charge storage kinetics [20–22]. Sun et al. 
[23] reported single-crystalline ultrathin Co3O4 nanosheets 
with massive vacancy defects by mild solvothermal reduction. 
Electrochemical evidence indicated that this promoted performance was due to the larger electrochemical surface area, more 
favorable kinetics, and better electrical conductivity. Thus, 
inducing oxygen vacancies in ZnO and coupling with carbon  and NiO should be feasible for improving the electrochemical 
performance of ZnO-based hybrids. 
Metal-organic framework (MOF) is a new porous material 
composed of metal ions and organic ligands [24, 25]. Structural 
tunability and flexible choice of elements make MOF a promising 
material widely used in many fields [26]. To date, various 
nanostructures have been successfully prepared using MOFs 
as precursors for energy storage and conversion devices [27]. 
High-temperature annealing of MOF materials is expected to 
induce surface defects in the nanostructure, thereby facilitating 
electron transfer. Jiao et al. [28] reported Ni/NiO microparticles with subtle lattice distortions by annealing Ni-MOF. 
The as-synthesized Ni/NiO nanoparticles exhibit specific 
capacitance of 684.4 mF·cm−2 at 1 mA·cm−2. Furthermore, carbon 
and metal oxide can be obtained simultaneously by annealing 
the MOF precursor in an inert atmosphere. However, to date, 
studies on the ZnO-based hybrids derived from MOF with 
abundant surface defects for supercapacitors are limited. The 
mechanism or certain effects of reaction or conductivity are 
not sufficiently clear. 
In this study, we prepared Ni/Zn-based organic framework 
followed by a thermal decomposition process to produce the 
ZnO/Ni/NiO nanocomposite dispersed in carbon material with 
the interconnected 3D structure. We aim to explore the possible 
mechanism of catalyst reaction, and studied the crystal structure 
of ZnO and micro structures of Ni and NiO in the studied 
samples. The Ni/ZnO-600 (sample annealed at 600 °C) electrode 
shows the superior specific capacitance, rate capability, and 
long-term cycling stability. Present work might provide a new 
strategy to synthesize ZnO-based nanocomposites, which can

and rapid charge/discharge processes [1–5]. But the low
energy density of SCs, especially the electric double layer
capacitors (EDLCs) based on carbonous materials, must
be boosted further for the demand of next generation
electronic devices. Pseudocapacitors as another kind of
SCs, based on pseudocapacitive materials storing charges
through Faradaic reactions, may reach several times
higher specific capacitance and energy density than normal EDLCs. With unique characteristics like environmental benignity and high specific capacitance, transition
metal oxides are intensively explored as redox oxides with
high pseudocapacitance for SCs. Cobalt oxides, like
Co3O4 [6,7] and CoO, also have high theoretical specific
capacitance [8]. However, they suffer from the inferior
rate capability and cycling stability because of their poor
electrical conductivity and volume change during the
charge/discharge process [9]. Therefore, combining electrically conductive components is considered to accelerate the electron transfer rate of cobalt-based
composites. For instance, CoO@NiO nano-architectures
on the activated carbon textile [10], CoO@CNT-x nanocomposite [11], Co3O4@PDA-rGO [12], and gold nanoparticles-decorated rGO-ZnCo2O4 nanocomposite [13]

and easiness of combining with other materials, ZnO often acts as good electrical and mechanical supports for
other components as electrode materials in SCs [14,15],
which can enhance the electrochemical performances of
metal oxide as supercapacitor electrode materials with
better electric conductivity such as ZnO/CoO nanosheets
microspheres [16] and hierarchical corn skeleton-like
ZnO@CoO [17]. However, most of them are still defective
for the relatively poor cycling stability.
Very recently, the introduction of oxygen vacancies
into metal oxides to improve the electrochemical performance for SCs has also received great attention [18–
22]. Oxygen vacancies in MnO2 [19] and hematite [20]
could significantly improve the conductivity of metal
oxides and accelerate the kinetics of surface redox reaction. Kim et al. [23] reported oxygen vacancies enhanced
pseudocapacitive charge storage properties of MoO3−x

charge storage kinetics.
In this study, we fabricated an ultra-stable pseudocapacitive electrode material, ZnO-CoO@nitrogen-doped
carbon (NC), for SCs with high electrochemical performance enhanced by oxygen vacancies (Fig. 1). The multifunctional polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) was used as a
structure-directing agent, the precursor of NC and the
initiator of abundant oxygen vacancies in zinc-cobalt
oxide microspheres. Meanwhile, PVP and conductive
ZnO nanocrystals combined with CoO nanocrystals to
fabricate cubic-like or prism heterostructure ZnO-CoO
nanobricks as the self-assembled backbone, later converted to the self-assembled mesoporous ZnO-CoO@NC
oval microspheres. The presence of electric conductive
ZnO and NC efficiently suppressed the collapse of the
microspherical structure during the charge and discharge

extremely remarkable cycling stability with 92% specific

high power delivery [3]. SCs have been considered as eco-friendly energy storage devices 
with commendable features like high power density, fast charge–discharge characteristics, 
peak operating voltage, long cycle life and reliability [4–7]. 
In order to realize good performance, there should be a balance between specific surface 
area and conductivity of the material. Use of porous/large surface area materials is one of the 
key approach for shortening the diffusion pathway of electrolytic ions. To enhance 
charge/discharge rate, several conductive agents are incorporated into electrode material 
[8,9]. However, effective volume density of the electro-active material decreases by addition 
of conductive agents [10]. Thus, to boost the conductivity as well as porosity, modification in 
composition and structure of the electrode material is a wise strategy. Silicon, a 
semiconducting material [11] has recently gathered attention in the area of energy storage due 
to its high abundance in earth crust, easy availability, minimal environmental impact, high 
thermal stability [12] and unique electronic and chemical properties. Porous silica (derivative 
of silicon) offers desirable properties such as high surface area, low toxicity [13], high 
differential capacitance (upto 180 µF cm-2) [14], hydrophilicity [15], and excellent chemical 
stability [16] enduring harsh environments like high temperature and strong acids/bases. 
Although silica has been explored in Li ion batteries [17–19], but the studies on utilization of 
silicon [20–23] and porous silica [24–28] as an electrode in supercapacitors are lacking. A 
vast array of morphologies [29–32] and the presence of large number of hydrophilic surface 
groups (e.g. OH) [33,34] make silica appealing as an energy storage material. In earlier 
studies, improvement in capacitance of carbon electrodes using SiO2 nanoparticle [35] as 
fillers has also been reported by Leonard et al. Other reports in continuation endorse the role 
of silica particles in polyaniline matrix in achieving better cycling stability [36]. Even though 
there are numerous advantages associated with silica, yet low electronic conductivity [37] i.e. 
its insulating nature (wide band gap) limits its application as a capacitive electrode. Hence, it 
is extremely desirable to improve the conductivity of silica electrode. To eliminate this issue, 
we have introduced intrinsic defects into the structure of silica. Electrochemical and 
electronic properties of metal oxides are strongly influenced by the intrinsic defects [38,39]. 
Introduction of oxygen vacancies (OVs), one of the intrinsic defects is considered as an n–
type dopant. These dopants improve the kinetics of charge storage and conductivity of the 
material by shifting Fermi level close to the conduction band [40]. Since, the formation 
energy of oxygen vacancy is small, it can be easily introduced as anion vacancy into the 
metal oxide [41 Different from previous studies, here silica is synthesized in cashew nut shaped morphology. 
This morphology provides more active edge sites for the participation in redox reactions. To 
further obtain the porosity in ionic accessible range, etching is carried out. Generally, etching 
deals at high temperature using corrosive and hazardous etchants (e.g. HF) [42]. We have 
adopted etching based on the spontaneous dissolution and regrowth of silica using NaBH4
(etching agent) and PVP (surface protecting agent) [43]. The abovementioned process does 
not require harsh conditions and can be performed in the absence of inert atmosphere, thus 
turning out to be completely facile, green and economical. Interestingly oxygen vacancies 
(OVs) with the aid of NaBH4 were introduced on the surface accompanied large size 
mesopores. Mesoporous structure helps in providing a large accessible surface area for ion 
transport/charge storage and also act as a buffering reservoirs [44–46] whereas oxygen 
vacancies (OVs) build the localized states below the conduction band so that valence band 
can easily overlap with the conduction band [47]. This in turn improves the conductivity of 
silica with enhancement in the active sites for redox reactions. Further, calcination treatment 
enriched the silica with small size mesopores. Thus, the final product exhibits bimodal 
mesoporosity with ample amount of oxygen vacant sites. Bimodal porosity is shown to have 
significant role in improving the ion-transport kinetics [48] as it increases the 
electrochemically active surface area of the silica by nearly four times than the BET surface 
area. In the present study, we have elucidated the synergistic effect of bimodal porosity and 
oxygen vacancy on the electrochemical performance of silica electrodes. Oxygen deficiency 
in silica results in a huge improvement in number of carrier/donor densities that in turn 
increases the rate of electron transfer. The deduction of oxygen from the SiO2 structure 
generates enormous free electrons that direct to the transition in behaviour from insulating to 
semiconductive [49]. This also lessen the potential barrier exist in between Fermi level of 
silica electrode and redox potential of electrolyte [50]. The oxygen deficient mesoporouscashew nut shaped silica electrodes acquires maximum energy density of 46.86 Wh Kg-1 at 
power density of 537.59 W Kg-1. The mesoporosity in the structure helps to attain excellent 
cycling stability upto 10000 cycles by acting as buffered spaces. For portable application, a

140-intro.txt.txt,"Along with increasing consumption of fossil fuels and continuous worsening climate, exploring renewable energy and efficient
energy storage devices for next generation has attracted worldwide
attention [1e5]. Electrochemical energy storage devices (EESDs)
are regarded as promising strategies for clean energy storages
owing to the renewability of electricity, such as lithium ion batteries (LIBs) [6e8], supercapacitors [9e16] and Zn-MnO2 batteries
[17]. Among these EESDs, supercapacitors (SCs) show apparently
gripping features of long cycle life, high power density, and excellent rate capability [2]. Compared with symmetric supercapacitors
(SSCs), asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) own wider potential
windows and increased energy density. However, relatively low
energy density is one of the bottlenecks of scale application for
ASCs [9,10]. Many researches focused on positive electrodes of ASCs
have been reported to attach this issue [9,12e14]. Carbon based
electrodes are usually employed as negative electrodes of ASCs
owing to their good electrical conductivity, relatively large surface
area, excellent chemical stability [18e20]. Unluckily, the intrinsic
low capacitance of carbon materials resulting from electric doublelayer behavior restricts the boosting of energy density. Thereby, to
achieve more efficient ASCs, it is highly desired to design and
fabricate new alternatives as negative electrodes with high capacitance, excellent conductivity and stability.
WO3, is an n-type semiconductor with a band gap of 2.7 eV [5].
Wide research interest has been focused on the investigation of its
genuine color switching for electrochromic devices, photocatalysts
and gas sensors [21e28]. Importantly, interstitial sites from ordered
stacking WO6 octahedra are effective accommodations for guest
ions, rendering the absorption and desorption of ions at the surface,
as well as insertion-deinsertion behavior inside [29e33]. Attributed to its intriguingly fast and reversible surface redox reactions
between W6þ and W5þ, recent years many progress about EESDs
based on WO3 nanomaterials with large effective area has been
reported [34e40]. However, the reported capacitive and cycling
performance of WO3 electrodes, especially the rate capability and
energy density, is still unsatisfactory resulting from its poorelectrical conductivity. Two main strategies have been employed to
improve the capacitive performance of WO3 electrodes, including
the development of nanoarchitectures with large effective surface
area and the combination with carbon materials to improve conductivity [26,27,35,40]. For example, Lei and co-workers combined
carbon nanofiber networks with WO3 nanorod bundles to build
ASCs with a specific capacitance of 254 F g 1 at a current density of
0.5 A 1 [41]. Lu and co-workers showed that WO3 dispersed in a
carbon aerogel is an outstanding supercapacitor electrode material,
achieving 700 F g 1 for the composite [37]. Nevertheless, the
capacitive performance of WO3 is still far from satisfaction to meet
the realistic demand. Developing WO3 anodes with superb capacitance and excellent cycle durability via a simple approach still
remains a great challenge.
In this work, we report a facile method to fabricate hydrogenated WO3 (donated as WO3-x) nanorods with enhanced crystallinity on carbon cloth promising as a stable negative electrode. The
incorporation of crystallinity and oxygen vacancy is demonstrated
to play an important part in the electrochemical performance of
WO3 nanorods. By introducing oxygen vacancies through annealing
in hydrogen atmosphere, the as-prepared WO3-x nanorods are
endowed with the improvement of conductivity and enhanced
electron transport. Simultaneously, enhanced crystallinity via hydrogenated treatment contributes to higher ion diffusion rate, more
reversible redox reaction and more stable microstructure.
Benefiting from these merits, the WO3-x electrode with improved
crystallinity achieves a high capacitance of 1.83 F cm2 at
1 mA cm2
, and remarkable durability with capacitance retention
of 74.8% after 10000 cycles. These results could open up new opportunities for WO3 materials as negative electrodes in constructing high-performance supercapacitors as next-generation EESDs"

Recently, supercapacitors, due to their larger power density than lithium-ion batteries 
and higher energy density than traditional dielectric capacitors, are extensively 
reported to be a promising candidate for the energy storage devices applicable for 
electric vehicle.2-4 Currently, transition metal oxides (for example RuO2, MnO2)
5-6
have been vastly applied in supercapacitors owing to their high pseudocapacitance 
through surface redox reactions.7
 However, these metal oxides are suffered from the 
poor electrical conductivity8-9 and the irreversibility of Faradic reactions on the 
surface of electrode,10 resulting in the low life cycle. Although the electrochemical 
stability can be enhanced by combining metal oxides with conductive materials (CNT, 
graphene, etc.),9, 11-12 it is desirable to improve the electrical conductivity and 
capacitive behaviour of metal oxide. 
 Titanium oxide, which has been widely applied as photocatalysts in the 
environmental purification, water splitting and dye-sensitised solar cell,13-19 is 
catching intensive interest in the energy storage, including lithium-ion batteries20 and 
supercapacitors.21 In comparison with state-of-the-art RuO2, titanium oxide is cheap,easy to synthesize with excellent chemical stability. However, current capacitances of 
titanium oxides are not comparable to other metal oxides (e.g. RuO2, MnO2)
6
 due to 
their poor electronic conductivity and inferior electrochemical activity.22, 23 Although 
many attempts have been explored to improve its electrochemical performance, such 
as hydrogenation8, 24-26 and nitridation,21, 27-29 the process are usually 
difficult-controlling and low-efficiency.30, 31
Herein, we proposed a fast, one-step and tunable approach to obtain titanium 
oxides with oxygen defect and nitrogen dopants via an arc-discharge process and 
subsequent nitridation.32-35 Through controlling the atmosphere in the arc-discharge 
process, the degree of oxygen vacancies of titania can be tuned with the different 
appearance. The electrical conductivity and electrochemical performance of these 
titanium oxides regulate along with the oxygen defects and nitrogen dopants. 
Specifically, the as-prepared TiO2-x:N achieves the impressive specific capacitance of 
210 F g−1 at 2 mV s−1, which is significantly higher than that of nano-TiO2 (P25). 
Furthermore, the TiO2-x:N with great stability up to 10,000 cycles reveals its 
prospective candidate as one of energy storage materials in future."

144-intro.txt.txt,"Recently, owing to the destruction of environment and depletion 
of fossil fuels, it is great important to design and develop new 
equipment to store energy [1–4]. Supercapacitors play an important 
role in addressing these issues due to their excellent power density 
and ultra long lifespan [5–8]. However, energy density is one of the 
most frequently stated problems with traditional supercapacitors. 
For this reason, transition metal oxides(TMOs) with faradic charge 
storage, such as MnO2, Co3O4, TiO2, [9–11] have been reported to be 
used as the electrodes for supercapacitors due to ultra-high theoretical specific capacity, environmental friendliness and chemical 
stability [12,13]. Nevertheless, several studies have documented that 
the capacity of TMOs were far less than the theoretical capacity. It 
has been argued that the poor intrinsic conductivity and relatively 
low contact performance of the transition metal oxides reduce redox 
kinetics and limit energy density. It is urgently needed to enhance 
the practical capacities of transition metal oxides. 
Recently, considerable literature has emerged around the theme 
of component and nanostructure of transition metal oxides. Dong 
synthesized nanostructured Co3O4 in situ on graphene through a 
simple hydrothermal procedure, in which the Co3O4/graphene hybrids exhibits great capacity with a long cycling life [14]. Kolathodi 
prepared NiO nanofibers through a simple and cost-effective 
electrospinning method [15]. An asymmetric supercapacitor, using 
the NiO nanofibers as positive materials and active carbon as negative materials, delivered remarkable high capacity and exhibited 
good cycle stability [16]. Kong designed a Co3O4 @MnO2 material 
through a low-cost method for high-capacity supercapacitors. The 
novel 3D hierarchical core-shell heterostructures, where the Co3O4 
acts as the “core” and the MnO2 acts as the “shell”, enlarge surface 
area and provide electron pathway [17]. 
Recent evidence suggests that ternary transition metal oxides 
(TTMOs) have been widely used as electrode of supercapacitors 
owing to the nature of multiple oxidation states and complex physical and chemical properties [18–21]. It has been reported that 
MgCo2O4 provided a ultrahigh theoretical capacity (3122 F g−1) [22]. 
Previous research has reported the effects of different morphologies 
on the properties of MgCo2O4 [23–25]. However, the observed value 
(320 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1) is far less than the theoretical capacitance [26]. 
Another viable route to enhance the capacity of TTMOs is oxygen 
vacancies. Oxygen vacancies can act as shallow donors to increase 
the concentration of carrier, thereby enhancing the electrical conduction of TTMOs. The limited reports show that the surface oxygen 
vacancies of metal oxides lead to faster charge storage kinetics and 
more active reaction sites. The introduction of oxygen vacancies also 
preserves the crystal structure during the long-term cycle [27–30]. 
Yang introduced oxygen vacancies into α-MoO3−x through defect 
engineering. The oxygen vacancies improved capacitance of 
α-MoO3−x by enhancing electrical conductivity and increasing electrochemical active sites [31]. Zhao designed oxygen vacancies 
Bi2O3 nanosheet arrays by a facile method [27]. The oxygen vacancies and unique morphology together improve the performance 
of Bi2O3. No work has been devoted to the effect of oxygen vacancies 
on the capacity performance of MgCo2O4. 
Here, we reported a facile method to fabricate MgCo2O4−x with 
rich oxygen vacancies (OV-MgCo2O4) as positive electrode of supercapacitors. The representative synthesis route involves the preparation of bulk MgCo2O4 by hydrothermal method and then 
reduction in the 0.2 M NaBH4 solution to introduce the oxygen vacancies into bulk MgCo2O4. The obtained OV-MgCo2O4 with enormous oxygen vacancies demonstrates enhanced capacitance of 
460 F g−1, superior than the pristine MgCo2O4. Meanwhile, an ASC 
assembled with OV-MgCo2O4 and active carbon exhibits great energy density of 18.7 Wh kg−1. "
145-intro.xtx.txt,"Renewable energy sources such as wind and solar have already 
sort to be the practical alternatives to fossil fuels in energy 
generation. However, the intermittent energy produced by these 
sources requires the energy to be stored and released on 
demand. This spots the importance of energy storage devices. 
Supercapacitors with high capacitance and excellent capacitive 
retention developed from low-cost fabrication techniques are 
need of the hour considering their potential utility in the 
commercial market. It remains a challenge to design 
supercapacitor devices with porous metal oxide (MO) materials 
having a good capacitance and cycle life. Metal-oxide based 
pseudocapacitors are excellent candidates for research as these 
materials possess multiple oxidation states that can contribute to 
the overall enhancement of capacitance values in comparison to 
the electrical double-layer capacitors (EDLC’s).
[1-3] Many oxides 
of transition metals are used for pseudocapacitor applications, 
including MnO2,
[4,5]
 NiO,[6] Co3O4,
[7]
 VO2,
[8] MoO3,[9] and 
hydroxides like Ni(OH)2,
[10] Co(OH)2,
[11] etc. However, due to the 
semiconducting behavior of these metal oxides, the 
transportation of ions between the electrode and electrolyte 
interface is slightly restricted. To overcome this issue, a 
combination of binary and ternary oxides is being investigated.[1, 
12] Amongst these, NiCo2O4 is of particular interest because of its 
high theoretical capacitance, superior electrochemical activity, 
and good electrical conductivity over the individual metal 
oxides.[13-15] To date, various synthesis routes have been 
employed like sol-gel,[16] hydrothermal,[17] microwave,[18]
template-assisted,[19] and electrodeposition[20]
for having different 
nanostructures of NiCo2O4 such as nanotubes,[21] nanosheets,[22]
nanowires,[23] nanoneedles,[24] etc. that contribute in various 
ways for increasing the capacitance owing to their inherently 
high active area available for redox reactions. All these 
synthesis routes except electrodeposition results in the powder 
form of nanostructures, which require additional binders to 
attach to the current collector, further leading to an increase in 
the ohmic loss due to contact resistance.
Electrodeposition is a unique and well-established process for 
the development of thin films, as it can control the surface 
morphology, thickness, uniformity, and is suitable for large-area 
manufacturing with low capital investment.[25, 26] Different types 
of current collectors/substrates have been used for the 
fabrication of electrode materials for supercapacitors such as 
ITO, Cu foil, Ni foil, Ni foam, carbon cloth, carbon paper etc.[20, 27-
31] However, the deposited metal oxides being poorly conductive 
and not meeting the commercial stability requirements further 
research is being focused on improving the electrochemical 
performance, stability and conductivity of the electrode materials.
A few of the strategies involve, (i) synthesis of various MO 
nanostructures with high surface area, (ii) preparation of MOcarbon nanocomposites, improving the conductivity and (iii) 
enhancing the electrochemical performance by synergic 
contributions of MO-MO composites. In view of the complex 
synthesis approaches to the above strategies, it is desirable to 
amend the intrinsic properties of the synthesized MO to enhance 
its conductivity, stability and electrochemical activity. Recently, 
few studies have reported that increasing oxygen vacancies in 
the metal oxides leads to an enhancement in their conductivity 
reflecting in their superior electrochemical performances.[31]Introduction of oxygen vacancies has three main advantages; 
namely enhancement of diffusion of charge carriers to increase 
the conductivity of metal oxides, increment in the adsorptivity of 
hydroxide ions in the aqueous medium, and the oxygen 
vacancies itself acting as dynamic sites for faradaic mechanisms, 
thereby increasing the Csp of Pseudocapacitors.[32]
It is reported 
by Teng Zhai et al. that an increment by 218% in the gravimetric 
specific capacitance of MnO2 nanorods is observed with the 
introduction of oxygen vacancies at 10 mV s
-1 scan rate in 
comparison to the pristine electrodes by hydrogenation 
method.[33] A boost in the capacitive rate retention by 23% is 
observed in NiCo2O4 (NCO) with added oxygen vacancies 
introduced by employing different precursor ratios of N2:O2.
[34]
Besides, a 77% increase in the initial capacitance with good rate 
retention from 5 to 50 mV s-1 scan rate is observed when 
chemical reduction method is employed to introduce oxygen 
vacancies within NCO nanosheets.[32]
It is reported that NaBH4, 
a strong reducing agent acts as an oxygen absorber, thereby 
removing the oxygen atoms previously bonded to Ni-O and CoO bonds. The electrons that were present on the oxygen 2P 
orbital are now at closer proximity to the Ni2+, Co2+ and O atoms,
increasing the electron delocalization, conductivity and thereby 
the charge transfer kinetics.[32] On a similar note, reduced αMoO3-x with an enhanced number of oxygen vacancies leads to 
an increase in the Van der Waal's gap (interlayer spacing) of 
MoO3-x promoting fast charge transfer kinetics, enabling the 
material to retain its shape during insertion and de-insertion 
reactions with higher specific capacitance.[35]
. Hence, metal 
oxides with added oxygen vacancies introduced by different 
reduction methods, namely chemical treatment,[32]
hydrogenation,[33] and different precursor amounts of N2:O2
[34]
 
are reported as excellent means to enhance the charge storage 
capabilities of the electrodes for supercapacitorIn the present work, a potentiostatic electrodeposition of 
NixCo2x(OH)6x is performed on carbon paper followed by 
annealing to produce NiCo2O4 electrodes. Oxygen vacancies 
are induced by varying the concentration of NaBH4 as an 
economical oxygen scavenger to achieve NCO nanosheetnanoflake morphology. The oxygen vacancies had led to an 
increase in the number of nanoflakes within each nanosheet. 
Porous NiCo2O4 nanosheets with induced oxygen vacancies 
deliver the highest reported capacitance for the first time by 
oxygen vacancy amplification and exhibit remarkable cyclic 
stability. Finally, using the best performing electrode and carbon 
derived from jute stick as respective positive and negative 
electrodes, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) is fabricated, 
whose electrochemical performances are investigatencrease the hydrophilicity of the substrate, being advantageous 
for electrodeposition as well as charge storage mechanism.
The FESEM images (ESI Fig. S1a and b) show the surface 
morphologies of both bare and activated carbon papers (ACP).
A noticeable increase in the surface roughness with surface 
modification is seen after the activation process. The property of 
substrate wettability is investigated by contact angle 
measurements (ESI Fig. S1c and d). A nullified contact angle for 
the ACP is ascertained to the attachment of hydroxyl (-OH), 
carbonyl (C=O), and carboxylic groups (-COOH), which also act 
as efficient polar sites to absorb the water molecules. Zhiyu 
Cheng et al. has reported similar findings to increase the 
hydrophilicity of commercial carbon materials by using a mixture 
of H2SO4 and K2Cr2O7, which increases the surface roughness 
due to the attachment of polar groups.
[36] X-ray photoelectron 
spectroscopy (XPS) is used to study the elemental and oxidation 
states of the involved elements. The presence of only carbon 
and oxygen on ACP has been discovered by the survey spectra 
(ESI Fig. S2a). Three different functional groups involving 
carbon, namely C-C, C-O-C, and -C-OH, are identified in the 
core level spectra of C 1s (ESI Fig. S2b) positioned at 284.4, 
286.2, and 288.2 eV respectively. Similarly, three distinct peaks 
are observed in the wide scan spectra of O 1s (ESI Fig. S2c), 
indicating the presence of C-O-C, C-O-H, and H-O-H functional 
groups at the binding energies of 530.2, 531.5 and 532.6 eV, 
respectively. Thereafter, NCO Nanosheets were 
electrodeposited potentiostatically on to ACP. Fig. 1a shows the 
schematic of a two-electrode system used for the 
electrodeposition of Ni-Co hydroxide and Fig. 1b gives an overall 
picture of the process involved during the synthesis of NCO 
nanosheets with induced oxygen vacancies"
146-into.txt.txt,"The growing energy consumption and 
environmental concerns have urged the 
development of energy production and 
storage. Particularly, enormous effort 
has been devoted to expanding efficient 
energy storage systems, including lithium-ion batteries and supercapacitors.[1–4]
However, they are unable to provide 
high energy/power densities at the same 
time, which is still a great challenge in 
their practical applications. Fortunately, 
lithium ion capacitor (LIC) has a great 
potential to combine the superiorities of 
high energy and power densities,[5]
 but 
LICs composed of energy-type anode 
and power-type cathode face unbalanced 
kinetics (the chemical reaction kinetics of 
anode is much slower than the physical 
adsorption process of cathode). To overcome this issue, great efforts are sought 
to develop various anode materials, such 
as carbon, metal oxides/nitrides/sulfides, 
and their composites.[6–10]
 Among of 
them, carbon materials have been widely studied. However, 
they have very low initial coulombic efficiency and critical 
safety issue due to their very low Li+ intercalation potential 
(below 0.1  V vs Li+/Li). By comparison, the titanium-based 
compounds possess high working voltage, which can effectively avoid lithium plating on the electrode and enable 
extremely high rate performance. J. B. Goodenough’s group 
reported that TiNb2O7 with a monoclinic layered structure 
(C2/m) possesses a high theoretical specific capacity of 
387 mAh g−1
, but its poor ionic diffusivity and low electrical 
conductivity limit its practical applications.[11,12]
 In view of 
that, many strategies have been conducted to improve the 
electron/ion kinetics, such as carbon coating, element doping, 
reducing the particle size, and defect engineering.[13–24]
 It is 
worth mentioning that these approaches display many merits 
for achieving better electrochemical performance. Particularly, the existence of defects can result in the improvement 
of conductivity and charge transport kinetics.[21,22]
 Moreover, 
the vacancies can supply extra active sites for higher capacity. 
In spite of the substantial efforts, however, these defect engineering techniques still have drawbacks, such as high-cost 
and complicated synthetic routes. It is urgent to develop a facile way for the formation of vacancies to enhance electrochemical performance.
Herein, in situ defect engineering in TiNb2O7-x nanochains 
was successfully achieved by a facile electro-spinning method. 
HRTEM and XPS results indicate there are some oxygen vacancies generated in the TiNb2O7-x nanochains due to the carbon 
thermal reduction reaction in the presence of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) decomposition at high temperature. Such oxygen 
vacancies can enhance the electronic conductivity and provide more active sites for lithium ion storage. Moreover, some 
atoms are rearranged in the crystal structure of TiNb2O7-x
during the annealing process, leading to the enlargement of 
lattice spacing, which is beneficial to the reversible lithium ion 
insertion/de-insertion and storage. As expected, the TiNb2O7-x
nanochains exhibited remarkable reversible capacity of 
440 mAh g−1
 at 0.1 A g−1
 within 0.01–3.0  V, which is almost 
twice higher than that within 1.0–3.0 V. Moreover, it also possessed a superior rate capability of 126 mAh g−1
 at a high current density of 5.0 A g−1
, as well as an excellent cycling stability 
of 92% retention after 2000 cycles at 1.0 A g−1
. Furthermore, the 
TiNb2O7-x-based LIC device delivers a high energy density of 
114 Wh kg−1
 at 111.83 W kg−1
 and remains 46.88 Wh kg−1
 even 
at an ultrahigh power density of 22 502.4 W kg−1
, indicating its 
high-rate performance. The LIC also shows a superior cycling 
stability of 95% retention after 1000 cycles at 1.0 A g−1
. These 
results indicate that the oxygen-defective TiNb2O7-x nanochains with enlarged lattice spacing would be a very promising 
candidate as anode for high-rate LICs"
147-intro.txt.txt,"Currently, industry and scientific communities are looking for inexpensive sources of 
energy such as hydrogen (which can be generated by electrocatalysis using efficient materials 
such as porous W-doped CoP nanoflakes and WSe2 semiconductor [1,2]) and for efficient energstorage devices with high mechanical properties (flexibility and stretchability). Energy storage 
devices with these characteristics would motivate the development of wearable electronics 
products such as flexible sensors, bendable cell phones, and flexible displays [3]. Actually, 
lithium ion batteries (LIBs) and electrochemical supercapacitors are the forefront technologies to 
provide energy for wearable or portable devices [4]. However, the main issues of the LIBs are 
flammability, shortage of the Li component, dendritic lithium short circuit, relatively high cost, 
and thermal instability after long periods of operation, among others [5]. For supercapacitors, the 
main problems are: i) their performance depends on the surface area of the electrode, pore size, 
and the electrical conductivity; ii) they have a short discharge time; and iii) they have lower 
energy densities than LIBs [6]. In order to solve these problems, other technologies have 
emerged like graphene/carbon nanotubes (CNTs) based batteries/supercapacitors (SCs), which 
have superior properties such as flexibility, compact size, being lightweight and environmentally 
friendly, and having fast charge-discharge and higher cycling [3,7]. Particularly, graphene has 
attracted attention because it can be doped with a rich-electron organic molecular such as 
Polyethylenimine (PEI) to improve the stability of graphene field effect transistors (GFETs) [8] 
or to make efficient electrodes for SCs. For example, Zang et al. [9] fabricated thin-film 
supercapacitors that use graphene woven-fabric (GWF) films as electrode materials. The GWF 
films were synthesized by using chemical vapor deposition on copper mesh. This device 
presented an specific capacitance of (267 F/g) and 100% of capacitance retention after 1,000 
charge/discharge cycles. Ervin et al. [10] printed graphene electrodes on Kapton tape, obtaining a 
maximum specific capacitance of 192 F/g and a power density of 10 kW/kg. Gao et al. [11] 
reported a solid state supercapacitor with low cost and environmentally-friendly electrodes made 
of cellulose fibers decorated with reduced graphene oxide (rGO), which reached a highcapacitance of 207 F/g and capacitance retention of 99% after 5,000 charge/discharge cycles. 
Also, SCs made with graphene and activated carbon reached a maximum capacitance of 59 F/g 
and power density energy of 65 kW/kg [12]. The capacitance retention of this device was 95% 
after 10,000 cycles. Furthermore, thick electrodes of graphene (400 µm) have been employed to 
fabricate planar SCs with specific efficiencies as high as 172 F/g [13]. Additionally, CNT based 
SCs have been reported to improve the stretchability and flexibility of supercapacitors. Some 
electrodes used to fabricate those devices are CNTs/Polyanine (PANI), CNTs/polyimide (PI), 
RuO2@CNTs, or CNTs/MnO2 [14–17]. The conductive polymers PANI and PI provide better 
flexibility properties to the CNTs’ electrode, while the RuO2 and MnO2 are used to enhance the 
electrochemical performance of the supercapacitors by pseudocapacitive effects [15–17]. Energy 
densities of 100–300 Wh/kg and specific capacitances of 100–320 F/g are reported for these 
CNT based SCs. Although the mentioned graphene/CNT based energy storage devices present 
high specific capacitances and high electrochemical stability, they present various problems such 
as complex, long, and expensive procedures for fabricating their electrodes or deficient 
encapsulation, which could cause the corrosive electrolyte to leak. Moreover, their charge times 
are similar to the discharge times; therefore, their charge/discharge profiles have a triangular 
shape. This is a disadvantage because longer times (20 to 150 min) are required to complete the 
charge. Due to the last problems, energy storage devices with the following characteristics are 
still required: fast charging time, long discharge time, easy fabrication process, and low cost. 
As an effort to fabricate graphene based energy storage devices at low cost, some groups 
have employed vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) based electrodes, an inexpensive and abundant 
thermochromic material which facilitates the intercalation-desintercalation of Li+
 ions [18, 19]. 
Therefore, V2O5-graphene nanocomposites, Na-V2O5-graphene nanocomposites, and V2Ocryogel/graphene nanosheet composites have been used as cathode materials to enhance the 
performance in LIBs/Na based batteries [18, 20–22]. Moreover, V2O5 is a promising candidate 
for electrode material because of its high theoretical capacitance of 2120 F/g [23]. Several works 
about graphene electrodes containing V2O5 have been reported: Ahirrao et al. [24] synthesized a 
composite made of V2O5 nanowires and graphene oxide (V2O5 NW-rGO), which was studied as 
electrode material using a three electrode configuration (the electrolyte used in the cell was 1 M 
NaSO3). They reported a maximum capacitance of 1002 F/g (at 1 A/g), energy density of 116 
Wh/kg, power density of 1520 W/kg, and capacitance retention of 83% after 5,000 cycles. 
Furthermore, Lee et al. [25] evaluated the electrochemical performance of an electrode made of 
V2O5 nanowires and rGO for the same number of cycles and obtained similar capacitance 
retention (82%) but lower capacitance (288 F/g). Furthermore, Liu et al. [23] fabricated a hybrid 
aerogel composite electrode made of V2O5 nanospheres and graphene sheets (rGO/V2O5) and 
found a maximum specific capacitance of 384 F/g (at 1 A/g) and energy density of 80.4 Wh/kg. 
In this work, the electrolyte employed was 1M LiClO4/PC (propylene carbonate). If the 
rGO/V2O5 electrode is mesoporous, a capacitance of 384 F/g was obtained in 1M NaSO3
electrolyte [4]. In addition, Saravanakumar et al. [26] fabricated an interconnected V2O5
nanoporous network and studied its electrochemical performance in K2SO4 aqueous electrolyte 
for SCs applications. They state that the introduction of a nanoporous network enhanced the ion 
diffusion and reached a capacitance of 316 F/g and an energy density of 43.8 Wh/kg. Finally, Xu 
et al. [27] reported a maximum capacitance of 195 F/g (at 1 A/g) for graphene/V2O5 xerogels 
nanocomposites. 
Although the SCs based on V2O5 mentioned above have demonstrated good values of 
capacitance and power densities, they still have low energy density values due to their fastdischarge times (150 to 5,000 s), which limit their use as batteries for portable devices. 
Additionally, these V2O5 (VOx) based electrodes/supercapacitors require sophisticated and long 
procedures of synthesis (hydrothermal, precipitation, and solvothermal) methods, which are not 
appropriate for mass production. Due to these disadvantages, an easy method to fabricate a 
graphene+CNT/VOx composite electrode is proposed. This electrode was later used to make 
flexible graphene SCs with long discharge times. The novelty of this work is the fact that the 
graphene+CNT/VOx electrodes contained carboxylic groups/defects which worked as redox 
centers, this in turn, provided a high storage capacity to the SCs. The discharge time of these SCs 
was at least 10 h. If the SCs are made without CNTs, their discharge times are short, as 
previously reported VOx based SCs. The surface, chemical, and morphological analysis of the 
graphene+CNT/VOx composite electrodes was discussed to understand the high storage capacity 
of the SCs made with these electrodes."
148-intro.txt.txt,"In the effort exploring clean and sustainable energy sources such as solar and 
wind to overcome the coming challenges of fast fossil fuel consumption/depletion and 
the associated environment pollution, the energy storage and conversion including 
electrochemical energy technologies batteries, fuel cells, supercapacitors, and water 
electrolysis for hydrogen generation, etc. have been recently extensively developed [1, 
2]. Among these electrochemical technologies, supercapacitors, with higher power 
density and long cycle-life than batteries have been recognized as one of the most 
reliable energy storage/conversion devices, especially in the applications requesting 
high power in short-time pulse and long cycling durability [3]. However, the low 
energy density of supercapacitors is the main drawback for their many applications. 
In general, the energy density of a supercapacitor mainly depends on the 
electrode materials, electrolyte with a wide potential window. With respect to this, 
massive research reports have been focused on the exploration and development of 
novel electrode materials and electrolytes to increase the energy density. Regarding 
3 
supercapacitor electrode materials, metal oxides such as MnO2 and RuO2 are the most 
studied ones for which have the recorded highest specific capacitances. Tungsten 
trioxide (WO3), as one of the important transition metal oxides, is noteworthy because 
of its semi-conducting, ferroelectric and electrooptic properties [4]. Generally, WO3 
have several crystal structures, of which the majority are the deviations from the 
layers of ideal cubic ReO3 structure based on a corner-sharing [WO6] octahedral [5]. 
Through the distorting of [WO6] octahedra and replacing the site of tungsten atom, 
five polymorphs could be obtained at the temperature up to 1700 K, which are α, β, γ
δ and ε phases [6]. Another important structure is hexagonal WO3 (h-WO3), composed 
of layers of the tungsten bronze structure with six corner-connected [WO6] octahedra, 
in which the hexagonal rings could accommodate a large number of hydrogen ions, 
ammonium ions and alkali metal ions [7]. Certainly, these positive ions (M+
) in the 
structure can also occupy the trigonal cavities and the four-coordinated square 
windows in h-WO3 [8], inducing a great change in material’s physical and chemical 
properties. Due to these changes, h-WO3 materials can be widely used as the materials 
for electrochromic devices [9], gas sensors [10], Li-ion batteries [11] and 
supercapacitors [12]. h-WO3 has attracted attention as an anode material for Li-ion 
batteries due to its good thermal stability at room temperature, better electronic 
conductivity and well-known channel structure facilitating di usion and transport of ff
Li+
. It is estimated a large theoretical capacity of 700 mA h g-1 based on the following 
charge-discharge mechanism: WO3 + 6Li+
 + 6e- ⇔ W + 3Li2O [13]. In addition, when 
the monovalent cations (M+
) and electrons enter into WO3 lattice simultaneously, 
4 
WO3 is converted into tungsten bronze (MxWO3) with a blue color. Conversely, WO3
can switch to colorless when the M+
 and electrons deintercalate out of the crystal 
lattice of WO3, represented in the following chemical equation: WO3 (transparent) + 
xe−
 + xM+ ⇔ MxWO3 (blue) [14]. This characteristic makes it an attractive material 
for electrochromic devices. Especially, when h-WO3 turns into h-MxWO3 incorporated 
by other positive ions (M+
), where the value of x could be as large as 3.4 [15], a high 
theoretical specific capacitance can be obtained when it is used as the supercapacitive 
electrode materials. 
To investigate the electrochemical energy storage properties of WO3, a great deal 
of attentions has been paid on the design of nano-structures with enlarged surface area 
and increased adsorption activity. These designs include zero-dimensional WO3
quantum dots [16] and nanoparticles [17], one-dimensional WO3 nanorods [18], 
nanowires [19], nanotubes [20] and nanofibers [21], two-dimensional WO3
nanosheets [22] and nanoplates [23], three-dimensional WO3 nanospheres [24], 
nanoflowers [25], hierarchical [26] and nanoporous particles [27]. All of these WO3
nano-materials can show impressive specific capacitances, high energy densities and 
long cycling performances as tested in supercapacitors with electrode active WO3
materials mixed with polymer adhesive and conductive carbon coated on the 
conductive current collectors. 
The high rate charge transport is a key factor for supercapacitor electrochemical 
systems. For example, the MAX-phase group amterials (Mn+1AXn, where “M” is a 
transition metal element, “A” is a III-VI group element, and “X” is carbon or nitrogen 
5 
element) have gained widespread traction because of its outstanding high electronic 
conductivity (≈ 104
 S cm−1) [28]. Actually, because of the high electronic conductivity 
(10-10-6 S cm-1) [29] of WO3 its own, there is no need to add extra conductive 
additive to WO3 nano-materials. Recent studies showed that the ordered WO3
nano-arrays grown directly on conductive current collector could serve as the 
supercapacitive electrode material. For example, WO3 nanorod arrays grown on a Cu 
substrate could serve as the supercapacitive electrode, which exhibited a high specific 
capacitance of 463 F g-1 [30]. WO3 nanowire arrays could grow on carbon cloth as the 
supercapacitive electrode, which gave a high specific capacitance of 521 F g-1 [31]. As 
identified, different dimensional WO3 nano-arrays can have different properties. For 
example, h-WO3 nanowire arrays showed a faster electron transport times than that of 
monoclinic WO3 nanoflake arrays (WNFs) [32]. WO3 nanomaterials with different 
exposed faces were synthesized by Lin et al. [33]. Their result showed that different 
crystal forms and crystalline degrees could give different charge transfer behaviors. 
The WO3 nanowires exposed with {110} face showed a higher hole transport 
behavior than the WO3 nanosheets exposed with {001} face. Thus, the 
photoelectrochemical properties of such a WO3 nanomaterial could be influenced 
seriously by its crystal form, crystalline degree and exposed face. However, the 
correlative deep researches of WO3 nano-arrays with different crystalline degrees and
exposed faces in the field of energy storage have not been seen till now. 
In this paper, single crystal, polycrystal and hierarchical h-WO3 nanoflake arrays 
(WNFs) are synthesized via a simple hydrothermal process without adding any 
6 
organic additives. The morphologies, crystalline degrees and exposed faces of these 
WNFs are controlled with simple adjustments of reaction parameters. The effects of 
crystalline degrees and exposed faces of WNFs nanoflakes on the supercapacitive 
properties are investigated in this work. "
149-intro.txt.txt,"With the extensive application of portable and flexible electronics, it is quite necessary to 
explore high-performance energy storage devices, such as supercapacitors and metal ion 
batteries.1-7 The application of metal ion batteries is often limited by its low power, short cycle 
life, and long charge time. Therefore, the high-power electrochemical supercapacitors (SCs) have 
been intensively studied due to the fast charge/discharge process, light weight and excellent 
reliability. In order to meet the high energy density need of next generation electronic device, the 
energy density of SCs must be greatly enhanced. According to the equation of E = 1/2CV2
,
8
 the 
energy density (E) increases with the specific capacity (C) or/and the operating potential range 
(V). The asymmertric supercapacitors (ASCs) have been extensively developed to enhance the 
energy density of SCs, combining the voltage windows of a battery-type (or pseudocapacitors) 
electrode and an electrochemical double layer capacitors (EDLCs) electrode. Unlike EDLCs, 
which store electrical energy by accumulation of ions on the electrode surface, the battery-type 
(or pseudocapacitive) materials make use of fast redox reactions or phase changes on the surface 
or subsurface of electrode,9
 offering much higher energy densities than EDLCs. In pursuit of the 
SCs materials with high capacitance, transition-metal oxides including MnO2, Co3O4, NiO, etc., 
have been extensively exploited.10-15 Among these various transition-metal oxide, MnO2, an 
typical pseudocapacitive material, has attracted much attention due to the high theoretical 
specific capacitance (~1400 F g-1), low-cost, and environmental friendly.16, 17 However, the 
electrochemical performance of MnO2 is greatly limited by its poor conductivity (10-5~10-6 S 
cm-1) , hindering its application in energy storage filed. In order to overcome the limitation and 
boost MnO2’ electrochemical performance, many researchers have been focusing on developing 
nanostructured MnO2 or MnO2 based composite materials. For instance, some nanostructured MnO2, such as nanoparticles,18 nanoneedles19 and nanowires,20 have been prepared to shorten the 
charge-transport pathway and increase the accessible surface area. Ultrathin MnO2 nanosheets 
with the thickness of 3-4 nm was prepared and exhibited a high capacitance of 634.5 F g-1
.
21 This 
strategy of structure controlling is somewhat complicated, which usually involves accurate 
manipulation of the reaction kinetics as well as synthesis parameters. Another promising 
approach is to combine MnO2 with highly external conductive materials such as graphene,22
carbon fibers,23 carbon nanotube24, 25 and so on. Jang et al. fabricated carbonized 
polypyrrole-coated MnO2 micronodule through electrodeposition technique.26 Bao et al. 
synthesized graphene/MnO2/CNT and graphene/MnO2/PEDOT composites for high performance 
electrochemical electrodes by three dimensional conductive wrapping method.27 However, due to 
the restriction of the interface between MnO2 and other materials, the enhancement of MnO2
conductivity is still limited by this integration strategy.28
Recent years, in order to enhance the electronic properties and electrochemical performance of 
transition oxides, more and more researchers are focusing on the defect engineering (vacancy 
controlling) and exploiting the structure-property performance relationships.29 The electronic 
structure of some semiconductors can be modified significantly by defect engineering. Even 
more, in some extreme cases, the semiconductors that have low intrinsic electrical conductivity 
could be transformed into half-metallicity materials. The significent improvement in electrical 
conductivity for transition oxides realized by this defect engineering lead to the remarkable 
enhancements in catalytic and electrocatalytic performance. Annealing in reducing atmosphere 
(hydrogen) was reported to be an effective method for post-treatment of TiO2 , MnO2, and other 
metal oxide.30-32 Oxygen vacancies and lower valence ceated by annealing allowed metal oxides 
to have enhanced conductivity and charge transport property. However, the annealing methodcan only introduce oxygen vacancies in the surface region of metal oxides and the amount of 
oxygen vacancies is severely limited. In addition, the thermal annealing usally lead to the decreas 
of surface area and structural water, which was very improtant for promote the ion diffusion in 
oxide lattic. Alternatively, the thermal annealing with high temperature requires large amounts of 
energy and fuel. Therefore, it is not suitable for those thermally unstable materials, while it is not 
practical for the clean and sustainable energy development. Up to now, there are a few reports 
about the treatment of metal oxides with graphene oxide composite with reductant.33 Zhou et al 
fabricated SnO2 nanocrystal or Sn nanoparticles and nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide 
composites for Li-ion batteries anode materials through HH vapor reduction method.34, 35
However, the purpose of using reductant is to reduce the graphene oxide, and little attention has 
been paid to the modification of reductant on the geometric and electronic structure of metal 
oxides. Therefore, it is still highly desirable to develop facile and effective strategy that can 
simultaneously improve the electrical conductively and ion diffusion of MnO2 for achiving 
significant improvement of electrochemical performance. 
In this work, we report the synthesis of oxygen vacancies dominated manganese oxide loading 
on carbon fibers (denoted as CFs-MnOx) as flexible electrodes for SCs through an HH vapor 
reduction method for the first time. The HH vapor was utilized not only as reducing agent to 
introduce oxygen vacancies in MnOx, but also a dissolution recrystallization medium in Ostwald 
repening36 to form MnOx nanosheets with uniform orientation (Scheme 1). Owing to the oxygen 
vacancies and uniform orientation, the reduced MnOx nanosheets exhibited enhanced 
crystallinity, electrical conductivity and ion-transfer rate, and direct electrical contact to the 
supporting carbon fibers. Therefore, the reduced CFs-MnOx possesses a much higher specific 
length capacitance (1004.8 mF cm-1) compared to the pristine CFs-MnOx (437.4 mF cm-1) at the current density of 4 mA cm-1. Moreover, a high performance, fiber-shaped, wearable, and 
all-solid-state ASCs with adopting the reduced CFs-MnOx as cathode and an electrochemical 
activated graphene oxide on carbon fibers (denoted as CFs-ArGO) as anode was demonstrated 
for the first time. The fiber-shaped ASCs MnOx//ArGO exhibited a maximum operating voltage 
of 2 V, a high specific capacitance of 1.9 F cm-3, an exceptional energy density of 1.06 mWh 
cm-3 and power density of 371.3 mW cm-3. Our work sheds new light on the modification of 
transition metal oxide based electrodes to improve the performance of energy storage devices. "
150-into.txt.txt,"In the context of energy depletion, global warming and population expansion, developing sustainable and clean energy sources
becomes an inevitable trend [1,2]. Energy-storage system is crucial
to the utilization of new energy sources and is in the spotlight.
Supercapacitor, as one of the most attractive energy storage
devices, has attracted much attention due to its clear advantages
of high-power density, long charge-discharge cycle life and wide
working range [3–5]. Nevertheless, current commercial supercapacitors can only provide a maximum energy density of about 5
Wh kg1
, far below that of secondary batteries and fuel cells [6].
In order to assemble high-energy density supercapacitors, factors
like high specific capacity, excellent electrical conductivity, and
good mechanical stability are indispensable.
Transition metal oxides exhibit higher natural abundance and
theoretical specific capacity than carbon materials and conducting
polymers [7]. However, due to poor electrical conductivity and
insufficient active sites, the cycling stability of transition metal oxides is poor and the actual capacity is low [8]. Great efforts have
been made to modify transition metal oxides, among which the
formation of heterojunctions is a typical and effective method.
Heterojunctions could improve the reaction kinetics by modulating
the interfacial electric field. For instances, Li et al. designed MoSe2/
MoS2 heterostructures based on two-dimensional MoSe2 flakes
and MoS2 nanosheets by heterojunction engineering [9]. The abundant heterostructures in MoSe2/ MoS2 not only expose more active
sites for electrochemical reactions, but also take advantage of the
open porous space in the interlaced nanosheet arrays to facilitate
charge transport and exhibit excellent electrochemical properties.
Gayathri et al. synthesized foliated (CoPx)1-y/CoOy (0.44 > y > 0.0
6) heterostructures using 2D zeolite imidazole backbone (ZIF-CoL) as a precursor [10], and the heterostructures change the interfacial properties and electronic structure, exhibiting high specific
capacitance (466 F g1 at 5 A g1
) and excellent cycling stability
(91% after 10,000 cycles). Chuai et al. proposed a CuO-SnO2 reverse
cubic heterojunction, which shows superior properties (1972 F
g1
) and better cycle retention of 96.05% compared to singlecomponent CuO or SnO2 [11]. The above studies have shown that
heterojunctions can cause the redistribution of contact interface
charge, which is conducive to accelerating ion transport rate and
enhancing electrochemical kinetics, thus optimizing the electrochemical performance.
In addition to constructing heterojunction, introducing oxygen
vacancies (Vo) or electron vacancies in transition metal oxides
can also improve the electrochemical performances by shortening
the distance of electrons along the conduction band and promoting
the redox reaction between materials and electrolytes [12]. For
examples, Cheng et al. synthesized multivalent oxygen ion functionalized oxygen-deficient Co3O4 [13]. The concentration of carriers in the oxygen-deficient Co3O4 nanorods is significantly
increased, which improves the conductivity of oxygen-deficient
Co3O4. Hu et al. prepared MnO2-x@CoS core-shell structures with
oxygen vacancies, and this construction of oxygen vacancycontaining core-shell structures by electrodeposition of conductive
materials directly over the array exhibits excellent performance
(2 mA cm2
, 781.1 C g1
) [14]. Kim et al. compared the properties
of reduced and fully oxidized MoO3 [15]. It further confirms that
oxygen vacancies can lead to larger interlayer spacing and promote
charge transfer. However, oxygen vacancies may deliver instability
of the crystal structure [16,17]. Although both defect and heterojunction engineering can improve the electrochemical kinetics of
materials to a certain extent, neither of them can dramatically
improve the performances of supercapacitors due to their own
limitations.
Herein, we combine a synergistic strategy of defect and heterojunction engineering, reporting an efficient and simple two-step
process for the preparation of (Vo-ZnO/CoO) nanowire materials
with oxygen-containing defects in double transition metal oxide
heterojunctions. The as-prepared Vo-ZnO/CoO shows an excellent
capacity of 845 C g1 (1 A g1
) with a capacity retention of 70%
at high current densities (10 A g1
). Moreover, the asymmetric
supercapacitor (Vo-ZnO/CoO/NOPC) prepared with N/O co-doped
porous carbon (NOPC) as the negative electrode exhibits an excellent energy density of 51.6 Wh kg1 at the power density of
799.9 W kg1"

electrification.[1] Lithium-ion batteries store energy via reversible
Faradaic reactions and related lithium intercalation/de-intercalation into host materials.[2] On the contrary, the operating
principle of a conventional supercapacitor is based on ion
electrosorption at the interface of an electrolyte and high
surface area electrodes, such as activated carbon (AC).[3] These
energy storage principles are reflected by the inherently
different properties of both devices: A lithium-ion battery is a
high energy device with moderate power and longevity, while a
supercapacitor possesses a superior power density and cycle
life with an inferior energy density.[4] To overcome the intrinsic
limitations of each of these two technologies, device hybridization has been explored in recent years.[5–14]
Hybrid supercapacitors, combining the advantages of both
devices, were first introduced in a pioneering study of Amatucci
et al.[5] In this work, an asymmetric hybrid supercapacitor
combined an AC cathode with a lithium titanate anode.
Hybridization can also be realized by combining lithium-ion
battery materials with AC in the same electrode. These
composite electrodes have attracted considerable interest in
the scientific community and several material combinations
have been proposed.[6–14] Additionally beneficial synergistic
effects between both material classes have been observed, as
AC simultaneously decreases the electrode resistivity and can
act as a “shock absorber” for high currents.[7,12]
LTO is a promising lithium-ion battery electrode material for
high rate applications due to its inherent safety, high
Coulombic efficiency, negligible volume expansion during
lithiation, cost effective raw materials for synthesis, and
effective avoidance of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI)
formation.[15–17] The electrochemical behavior of LTO-based
electrodes may severely deteriorate because of LTO’s poor
intrinsic electronic conductivity of about 1013 S/cm.[14,18] However, there is an abrupt rise of electrical conductivity for
lithiated LTO (Li7Ti5O12) to about 102 S/cm.[19] At present, stateof-the-art literature appears to have split into two camps:
i.) The electrical conductivity of the lithiated phase (Li7Ti5O12) is
sufficiently high to operate LTO without any or very low
amounts of conductive additives (<5mass%).[20–25] Kinetic
limitations of LTO are mainly caused by sluggish lithium
diffusion and an improvement of electrical conductivity is
not required.[25,26]
ii.) The low electrical conductivity of Li4Ti5O12 deteriorates the
electrochemical performance and large amounts of carbon
are required for high rate operation. In this context, a
variety of LTO-carbon nanocomposites have been proposed;
for example, LTO confined in nanopores of AC,[27] and LTO
grafted on carbon nanotubes,[28–32] carbon nanofibers,[17,33–35]
or graphene.[36–40] The carbon content of the electrode is
often neglected when calculating the capacity (i. e., capacityis only normalized to the LTO mass of the electrode). Yet,
such a normalization is questionable as the electrode may
contain up to 20–50mass% carbon and only the performance of the entire electrode is of importance for an actual
device (not how well a small quantity of LTO performs in a
massive matrix of electrochemically inactive carbon).
The electrical conductivity of carbon and its distribution can
also severely influence the electrochemical stability of a
composite electrode as we have demonstrated recently.[14] LTO
doping (e. g., with Cu2+,
[41] Mg2+,
[42] Zn2+,
[43] Fe3+,
[44] Cr3+,
[45]
Al3+,
[46] Sn4+,
[47] Zr4+,
[48] Ta5+,
[49] V5+,
[50] Nb5+,
[51] W6+[52]) is another
effective way to improve the intrinsic electronic conductivity of
LTO. Such doping elements have been reported to reduce a
fraction of Ti4+ into Ti3+ and hence increase the overall electron
concentration.[53] Nevertheless, element doping might entail
additional problems related to the toxicity of certain doping
elements and possible detrimental side reactions.[54]
In 2006, Wolfenstine et al.[55] discovered that Ti3+ valence
states may form during prolonged annealing (36 h) of LTO at
8008C in hydrogen containing atmosphere, although the root
cause of this effect remained unknown. This simple strategy is
free of waste products and does not require the addition of any
other additional chemicals or catalysts,[56] but has only attracted
little attention in literature so far (especially in contrast to the
large number of studies addressing carbon-LTO nanocomposites or LTO doping). Shen et al.[57] proposed annealing of LTO
nanowire arrays under hydrogen atmosphere to create Ti3+
valence states. A minor shift of the Ti 2p X-ray photoelectron
spectra to lower binding energies after hydrogen treatment
confirmed the formation of Ti3+ valences. This change was
attributed to the formation of OH surface defects after hydrogen treatment. Hydrogen treatment was conducted in 5 vol%
H2 in Ar at 500–7008C for 1.5 h, while the pressure or the
impact of the treatment temperature was not specified. Later
work of Qiu et al.[56] was conducted with industrial grade LTO in
high purity H2 gas sourced from a metal-hydride at a high
pressure of 40 bar for 1 h. It was suggested that the elevated
temperature “facilitates the opening of the LTO lattice” while
the high pressure “helps the deep penetration of hydrogen into
the LTO bulk”.[56] In this work, it was also proposed that, besides
OH groups, additionally oxygen vacancies are responsible for
the Ti3+ valence states and the improvement of the rate
performance. The enhanced electrochemical kinetics were
attributed to increased electronic conductivity caused by Ti3+
valence states and a simultaneously improved Li-ion diffusivity
due to larger diffusion pathways in the oxygen-deficient LTO.
Sen et al. conducted hydrogen annealing of LTO nanosheets at
5008C for 2 h with a heating rate 38Cmin1 (pressure not
stated) and concluded that “the introduction of Ti3+ species
and/or oxygen vacancies greatly improves the electronic
conductivity”.[58] Accordingly, current literature on this topic
seems to be inconsistent even on basic aspects like necessity of
pressure, temperature range of the reaction, and the underpinning processes causing Ti3+ valence states.
In the current study, we address these issues and provide
comprehensive data to identify crucial temperature ranges of
the reaction. The associated implications on material and
chemical properties (e. g., crystallinity, surface area, particle size,
phase contents, titanium valence state) will be investigated and
connected to the electrochemical behavior of LTO half cells and
LTO-based hybrid supercapacitors. For this purpose, a commercially available lithium titanate nanopowder was heated to
defined temperatures in hydrogen atmosphere, followed by an
immediate cooling to preserve prevailing material properties.
This allows us to adjust the concentration of Ti3+ valences and
to identify the rate limiting factor of a nanoparticulate LTO
electrode."

the reaction. The associated implications on material and
chemical properties (e. g., crystallinity, surface area, particle size,
phase contents, titanium valence state) will be investigated and
connected to the electrochemical behavior of LTO half cells and
LTO-based hybrid supercapacitors. For this purpose, a commercially available lithium titanate nanopowder was heated to
defined temperatures in hydrogen atmosphere, followed by an
immediate cooling to preserve prevailing material properties.
This allows us to adjust the concentration of Ti3+ valences and
to identify the rate limiting factor of a nanoparticulate LTO

153-intro.txt.txt,"Because of the unique structure and functional properties,
TiO2 becomes one of the candidate materials for the application in energy-associated fields, such as dye-sensitized solar
cells [1], lithium-ion batteries [2], and supercapacitors [3]. In
recent years, TiO2-based nanostructured materials have
attracted much attention [4–8]. Among the different morphologies, such as nanoparticles [9], nanowires [10], and
nanoribbons [11], TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNAs) prepared by
electrochemical anodization have superiority to be used for
supercapacitors because of their highly ordered structure, outstanding stability in most chemical atmosphere, large surface
area, controllable geometry (diameter, length, pore sizes, and
wall thickness), and readily synthesized in large scale by common methods of anodization. In addition, due to the highly
ordered structure and the in situ connection characteristics
from the Ti foil substrate, TNAs cannot only reduce the electric resistance of electrodes but also offer direct electron transfer pathways compared to non-oriented structures and easier
access for ion penetration than their solid rods or pillar counterparts [12]. Nevertheless, the poor electrical conductivity
and low electrochemical activity of TNAs result in a relatively
low specific capacitance ranging from 10 to 911 μF cm−2 [13],
which hinders their further application. Therefore, it is urgent
to find methods to modify TNAs to improve their intrinsic
electric conductivity and electrochemical activity [3]. Insummary, there are two main categories for the improvement
of electric conductivity, modification with noble metals (Au,
Pt, Ag) or non-metal impurities (C, N) [14–16] and the introduction of oxygen vacancies [3]. According to the reported
literature, the introduction of oxygen vacancies is mainly
based on electrochemical doping of pristine TNAs in
Na2SO4 aqueous solution [17] or calcinating anodized TNAs
in H2 atmosphere [3], which could enhance electric conductivity and make TNAs more suitable for the application in
supercapacitors. Furthermore, based on the carbon modification process, Cai’s research group [18] reported graphitized
carbon nanotubes formed in TNAs through carbonizing poly(-
ethylene glycol) 6000 at 600 °C for 6 h with a heating rate of
1 °C min−1 in N2 atmosphere, which presented high catalytic
activity. Wu and co-workers [19] prepared novel carbondoped TNAs with highly visible light photocatalytic activity
by the following two steps: adsorption of ethanol molecules in
the inner space of TNAs and followed by thermal treatment of
the complex in inert N2 atmosphere. Obviously, these asmentioned technologies all involved the additional step to
introduce carbon sources before carbonization, which could
not ensure the uniform distribution of the modified carbon and
also increase the complexity of the experiment.
Nevertheless, compared to other electroactive transition
metal oxides or some conducting polymers, the capacitance
delivered by pristine TNAs or modified TNAs is still too low.
Therefore, it is of great importance to combine other materials
with high capacitance to further improve the electrochemical
performance. In a wide range of the available electrochemically active electrode materials for supercapacitors, transition
metal oxides, hydroxides, and their composite are the excellent candidates due to their large theoretical capacitance and
fast redox kinetics [20], which can provide a variety of oxidation states for efficient redox charge transfer and exhibit much
higher charge storage compared with electric double-layer capacitors [21]. For example, ruthenium oxide (RuO2) can be
used as high-performance supercapacitors with ultrahigh specific capacitance [22], but its high cost, lack of abundance, and
environmentally poisonous nature inhibit its commercial application despite of the remarkable performance. Therefore,
numerous efforts have been made to search for alternative
low cost and environmentally compatible materials to substitute RuO2 [23–25]. Especially, Co3O4 is a promising material
for supercapacitors due to its low cost, natural abundance,
environmental friendliness, good thermal and facile synthesis,
and high theoretical specific capacitances (3560 F g−1
) [26,
27]. Recently, Liu and co-workers [28] reported the fabrication of high-performance supercapacitors based on Co3O4
nanowire@MnO2 ultrathin nanosheet core/shell arrays; a capacitance of 480 F g−1 was achieved at a current density of
2.67 A g−1 and only 2.7 % capacitance loss after 5000 cycles.
Hu’s group [29] prepared the well-dispersed Co3O4
nanocrystals on carbon substrate, with the assistance of carbon
in the three-dimensionally ordered macroporous framework;
Co3O4 nanocrystals could be effectively utilized, and the specific capacitance of this electrode reached as high as
555.2 F g−1 at 1 A g−1
. However, in the most cases, it takes
two procedures to fabricate Co3O4-based electrodes for
supercapacitors, formation of corresponding precursors and
followed by the thermal treatment to get the desired oxides,
which increases the experimental cost and duration.
Therefore, it is attractive to obtain nanocomposites with
high supercapacitive performance by a simple process. In this
study, we demonstrate our recent effort in developing homogeneous Co3O4/TiO2 nanotube arrays synergistically enhanced by carbon layer and oxygen vacancies for highperformance supercapacitors. Compared with traditional
carbon-coated and oxygen vacancies introduced processes
mentioned above, it is much more effective to modify with
both carbon layer and oxygen vacancies just in one calcination
step, and the anodized TNAs can be annealed and transferred
into pure anatase phase at the same time. Subsequently, Co3O4
nanoparticles are able to spontaneously deposited on both the
outer and inner surfaces of co-modified TiO2 nanotube arrays
(m-TNAs) by a simple process of forced hydrolysis of
Co(Ac)2 directly and without any other pre- or post-treatment.
What is more, without the use of any binders that form Bdead
surface^ to hinder the effective contact between electroactive
materials and electrolyte [30], the as-prepared self-supported
and binder-free Co3O4/m-TNA electrodes with enhanced
electrochemical properties could effectively improve the
Faraday efficiency of redox reactions. Owing to the synergistic enhancement effect of m-TNAs and Co3O4 nanoparticles, a
maximum specific capacitance of 662.7 F g−1 could be
achieved in 2-M KOH aqueous electrolyte, which is much
higher than that of Co3O4/TNAs (166.2 F g−1
). In addition,
the capacitance loss is only 14.0 % after 4000 cycles with a
high current density of 10 A g−1
, revealing the excellent longterm electrochemical cycling stability of the as-obtained
Co3O4/m-TNAs. This work demonstrated that the selfsupported and binder-free Co3O4/m-TNAs electrodes should
be promising and competitive candidates for highperformance supercapacitors"

including MnO2

, etc.[5-10] have 
been paid more attentions owing to their low costs and high 
specific capacitance. Among them, cuprous oxide (Cu2O) has been 
studied for use as a supercapacitor electrode material because of its 
low cost, relatively high conductivity, good thermal property and 
facile synthesis, which has been regarded as one of the most 
promising material in supercapacitor system.[11] Furthermore, Cu2O 
is a p-type semiconductor with a direct band-gap of 2.17 eV and the 
spin-0 excitons in the electronic structure also make it possible to 
become a promising material in energy storage devices such as 
solar cells, lithium-ion batteries and supercapacitors.
[9, 12]
Generally, the capacitance performance can be improved by 
advancing the high surface area, high thermal and chemical stability 
and high electronic conductivity of the material. So far, highlyordered TiO2
 nanotube arrays (TNAs) have received great attention 
owing to their high surface area, stability and direct transport 
pathways.[13] However, the poor electric conductivity of TNAs leads 
to a relatively low specific capacitance. To overcome this limitation, 
many efforts have been made in recent years. For instance, Salari et 
al.[14] found that the capacitance of TNAs can be enhanced through 
annealing treatment at a reducing atmosphere and confirmed that 
the introduction of oxygen vacancies in TNAs further improves the 
capacitance due to the Faradic reaction. Yat Li’s group
[15] reported a 
new and general strategy for improving the capacitive properties of 
TiO2 in hydrogen atmosphere at high annealing temperatures, and 
the H-TiO2
 prepared at 400°C yielded the largest specific 
capacitance of 3.24 mF cm-2 with a remarkable rate capability and 
outstanding long-term cycling stability. It is worthy of noting that 
the treatment in an atmosphere at high annealing temperatures is 
not suitable for practical application. A simple and easy method is 
highly required for modification of TNAs to reduce the electric 
resistance and improve the capacitance properties. Recently, Wu et 
al, [16] showed that TNAs exhibited a high specific capacitance of 
20.08 mF cm-2 at the current of 0.05 mA·cm-2 through a facile 
treatment of electrochemical doping approach. More interestingly, 
the capacitance of TiO2
 can be recovered by the same doping 
process after several cycles. 
On one hand, the highly ordered electrochemically doped TiO2
nanotube arrays (ED-TNAs) offers high surface area and greatly 
improved electronic conductivity, which has attracted much 
attention in charge storage devices; on the other hand, Cu2O is a 
promising material for pseudo-capacitor owing to its large specific 
capacitance. The ED-TNAs can serve as a good support for Cu2O 
electrode materials to form composite structures. Motivated by this, 
we employed ED-TNAs as a support for Cu2O nanoparticles to form 
Cu2O/ED-TNAs composite electrodes for supercapacitor. Herein, the 
ED-TNAs were fabricated by electrochemical doping process using a 
facile cyclic voltammetry method, and then Cu2O nanoparticleswere deposited onto ED-TNAs though square wave voltammetry 
(SWV) deposition method to synthesis the Cu2O/ED-TNAs 
electrodes. By taking the advantages of both ED-TNAs and Cu2O 
nanoparticles, the Cu2O/ED-TNAs electrodes achieved high 
electrochemical performance and excellent long-term cycling

155-intro.txt.txt,"Supercapacitors (SCs) have the advantages of rapid charge and 
discharge, high power density and stable operation, which make them a 
promising energy storage device [1–5]. The electrode material has a 
decisive influence on the overall performance of SCs. Therefore, the 
design of advanced electrode materials has become a hot topic. Generally, the electrode materials are classified into capacitive (carbon materials), [6] pseudocapacitive (e.g., MnO2) [7] and battery-like (e.g., 
NiO, Co3O4) [8] types according to the charge storage mechanism [9]. 
Carbon-based materials store energy through the electrostatic accumulation of charges at the interface between electrode and electrolyte, and 
pseudocapacitive materials store energy via near-surface faradaic redox 
reactions and possess electrocapacitive characteristics, thus limited 
specific capacitance is usually obtained. In contrast, battery-type materials have the ability to deliver much higher capacity by taking 
advantage of the deep surface faradaic reactions, thus they are mostly 
studied. 
Recently, battery-type transition metal sulfide (TMS) with low cost 
has attracted much attention. The low electronegativity of S and abundant valence states of TMS result in high conductivity and capacitance 
[10,11]. Therefore, various TMS nanostructures have been explored in 
SCs. For instance, Kale and co-works [12] prepared a cobalt sulfide film 
electrode by chemical bath deposition, and the electrode presented a 
specific capacitance of 252.39F/g at 5 mV/s. Zhang’ group [13]. prepared a hierarchical NiS microflower through two-step hydrothermal 
synthesis, and the NiS displayed high supercapacitive performance 
(1122.7F/g at 1 A/g). In comparison to monometallic sulfide, bimetallic 
sulfide exhibited better electrochemical performance since it possessed 
higher electrical conductivity and richer redox reactions [14]. Nevertheless, the intrinsically inferior rate capability and cyclic stability 
restrict the utilization of bimetallic sulfide in SCs [11]. To overcome these defects, an interesting concept is to couple metal sulfide with other 
conductive substance to form a core–shell heterostructure [15]. For 
example, Cheng et al. [16] reported a heterostructure of ZIF-67-derived 
Co3S4 hollow nanocages (HNCs) strung on polypyrrole (PPy) tubes, and 
the Co3S4-HNCs@PPy displayed remarkable specific capacitance 
(1706F/g at 1 A/g) and rate performance, significantly outperforming 
Co3S4-HNCs. Liu et al. [17] reported a Co3O4@Co3S4 heterostructure by 
partial vulcanization of Co3O4, and the Co3O4@Co3S4 showed better 
electrochemical performance than Co3O4 due to interaction between 
Co3O4 and Co3S4, which increased the reaction sites and promoted the 
charge transfer at active material/electrolyte interfaces. 
As a rare metal oxide, CeO2 has found broad applications in heterogeneous catalysis, oxygen storage, and electrocatalysis because of 
reversible redox couple (Ce3+/Ce4+), easy availability and environmental friendly feature [18]. The good redox characteristics and abundant oxygen vacancies also make CeO2 a potential electrode material for 
SCs. Moreover, the good mechanical resistance and anticorrosion abilities in alkaline media are also conducive to the applications in electrocatalysis and aqueous SCs. However, solitary CeO2 does not exhibit 
expected electrochemical properties due to poor electrical conductivityand low active sites [19]. Therefore, rational constructing porous CeO2 
nanostructures with high surface area to volume ratio and combining 
CeO2 with other electrode materials are two promising strategies to 
improve the electrochemical performance. 
Herein, we first report a heterostructure of straw-bundle-like CeO2@ 
(Ni, Co)3S4 nanosheets as electrode material for SCs. The porous CeO2 
was derived from cerium metal–organic framework (Ce-MOF) template. 
MOF has the advantages of high porosity and diverse structure, which 
make it suitable for electrochemistry and other applications [20–25]. 
The (Ni, Co)3S4 nanosheets were then anchored on MOF-derived CeO2 
via two-step hydrothermal synthesis (Scheme 1a). Such a hierarchical 
heterostructure has following merits as electrode materials for SCs 
(Scheme 1b). Firstly, the MOF-derived CeO2 can retain the high porosity 
of MOF, facilitaing electrolyte infiltration. Secondly, straw-bundle-like 
CeO2 is composed of 1D nanorods with high aspect ratio, providing 
rapid electron transfer pathway. Thirdly, the strong electronic coupling 
and rich oxygen vacancies at CeO2@(Ni, Co)3S4 interfaces promote 
surface reaction kinetics and charge transport. Finally, the core-shelled 
structure can prevent the aggregation of (Ni, Co)3S4 nanosheets. Taking 
these merits, the CeO2@(Ni, Co)3S4 displays outstanding specific 
capacitance (1319F/g at 1A/g) and rate performance (85.2% at 10 A/g), 
largely outperforming solitary CeO2 or (Ni, Co)3S4. In addition, the twoelectrode cell constructed with CeO2@(Ni, Co)3S4 and activated carbon 
(AC) also demonstrates large energy density (34.2 Wh/kg at 849.8 W/ 
kg) with excellent cyclic durability (84.8% incipient capacitance is

CeO2@(Ni, Co)3S4 in practical applications. The interesting heterostructure can be extended tand low active sites [19]. Therefore, rational constructing porous CeO2

an increasingly important role in global power generation [1]. However, 
the large penetration of intermittent renewables into power systems 
often gives rise to problems for grid management because electric grids 
must work under a balance between supply and demand of energy. In 
order to solve these problems, the utilization of energy storage devices is 
highly recommended, whereas the development and evaluation of 
suitable energy storage devices is still underway [2]. Among various 
energy storage options, advanced rechargeable batteries (such as 
lithium-ion batteries) have desirable energy densities, but some problems in terms of cycle life, safety performance, etc., still limit their 
application in this field [3]. As an alternative candidate, supercapacitors 
(SCs), especially aqueous SCs, have attracted much attention due to their 
high-power density, long cycle life, superior safety, as well as low cost 
[4,5]. However, it is still a challenge to improve the energy density of 
SCs to meet the requirement of practical applications. 
Given the decisive role of electrode materials in the energy density of 
SCs [6], extensive research has been conducted on the electrode material 
of SCs in the past years. As the only commercially available electrode 
material for SCs, carbon-based materials possess many advantages, such 
as good cycling stability and excellent electrical conductivity, but have 
relatively low specific capacitances due to their own charge-storage 
mechanism [7]. Unlike carbon-based materials, transition metal oxides 
can store electrical energy by redox reactions occurring on their surfaces 
or subsurfaces, and thus exhibit high specific capacitances [8], Therefore, to improve the energy density of SCs, transition metal oxides, such 
as RuO2, Fe3O4, Co3O4, NiMnO3, CoMoO4, etc., have been extensively 
investigated as electrode materials for SCs. [9–13]. However, these oxides can deliver high capacitances only when they operate in strongly 
acidic or alkaline electrolytes. Moreover, because most of the oxides 
have a narrow and positive working potential window [14,15], for 
extending the working potential window of SCs, they have to be used as 
positive electrode materials to fabricate asymmetric SCs with carbonbased negative electrodes.

manganese dioxide are the two transition metal oxides which can 
exhibit high specific capacitances in neutral or mild aqueous electrolytes 
[16,17]. V2O5 is expected to be a potential candidate electrode material 
due to its high theoretical specific capacitance, diverse oxidation 
valence states (2+, 3+, 4+, 5 + ), low cost, and layered structure [18]. 
So far, V2O5 nanomaterials with various morphologies and structures 
have been synthesized and investigated as electrode materials for SCs. In 
most cases, the morphology and nanostructure of V2O5 were carefully 
controlled through hydrothermal procedures to provide high specific 
surface area and facile ion-diffusion paths for electrode reactions 
[19–21]. To overcome the poor electrical conductivity of V2O5, V2O5 
nanomaterials were usually loaded or grown on carbon supports, such as 
graphene nanosheets, carbon-xerogel microspheres, and carbon nanotubes, to form composite electrode materials [22,23]. Despite the similarity in synthesis procedures, these V2O5 nanomaterials usually 
exhibited distinctive electrochemical behavior. Some of them delivered 
high specific capacitances, but presented charge–discharge curves with 
prominent plateaus, demonstrating evident battery-like behavior [24]. 
However, because the nanomaterials with different structures and 
morphologies were evaluated under different conditions (such as the 
dimension of guest ions, potential windows used for tests), it is still 
difficult to elucidate the relationship between their electrochemical 
behavior and nanostructures in accordance with the literatures [22–26]. 
Furthermore, although some V2O5 nanocomposite materials exhibited 
capacitive behavior and acceptable specific capacitances in neutral or 
mild aqueous electrolytes, they were usually tested as positive electrode 
materials for SCs. To the best of our knowledge, there is few capacitive 
anode materials which can deliver a matchable specific capacitance in 
neutral aqueous electrolytes. Clearly, the lack of suitable anode materials will hinder the application of V2O5-based materials in asymmetric 
supercapacitors. 
Herein, we report a strategy based on defect chemistry to tailor 
capacitive vanadium pentoxide/reduced graphene oxide (V2O5/rGO) 
hybrid electrodes for all-vanadium-oxide asymmetric supercapacitors. 
The related procedures involve the controlled synthesis of V2O5 nanobelts, the assembly of binder-free V2O5/rGO electrodes, and the electrochemical formation of positive and negative electrodes. Due to the 
dual charge-storage mechanism involving cation intercalation/deintercalation and oxygen-vacancy-related reactions, the obtained V2O5/ 
rGO positive electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance of 468.5F g− 1 
at 1 A g− 1 and excellent pseudocapacitive behavior in the potential 
range of − 0.1–0.9 V. The formed V2O5–VO2/rGO negative electrode 
also shows typical capacitive behavior in the negative potential range of 
− 0.8–0.1 V, delivering a specific capacitance of 406.8F g− 1 at 1 A g− 1
. 
The all-vanadium-oxide asymmetric supercapacitor assembled with the 
V2O5/rGO electrodes displays a high energy density and good cycling 
stability over the working potential window of 0–1.7 V, and the charge 
storage mechanism based on defect chemistry has been discussed in 
detail. We believe that the all-vanadium-oxide aqueous asymmetric 
supercapacitor has the potential for low-cost, large-scale, and safetysensitive applications, and the elucidated relationship between point 
defects and electrochemical characteristics may provide a new path 
toward understanding and designing high-performance electrode materials for aqueous energy storage devices. "
157-intro.txt.txt,"With the increasingly severe energy shortage and environmental 
pollution, the development of renewable energy to replace fossil fuels 
has become a focus of a global research effort [1,2]. The energy generated by renewable energy sources such as wind and solar suffer must be 
stored for future use, necessitating the development of advanced energy 
storage technologies. Supercapacitors have attracted intense attention 
as a candidate technology for solving the problem of efficient energy 
storage due to their advantages of high power density, fast charge and 
discharge and long service life [3–5]. Although supercapacitors have 
been investigated for applications in many fields, the low energy density 
of supercapacitors severely restricts their practical use. Increasing the 
specific capacity and widening the voltage window have been found to 
be effective methods for boosting the energy density of supercapacitors 
and improving their performance [6]. Generally, pseudocapacitive 
materials have a high specific capacity, and the voltage window can be 
broadened by constructing flexible solid-state hybrid supercapacitors 
(FHSC) [7,8]. 
Transition metal oxides have emerged as promising pseudocapacitive electrode materials due to their higher theoretical specific capacitance compared to those of the carbon-based electrical double layer 
capacitive materials. Among the transition metal oxides, manganese 
metal oxides (MnOx), and particularly Mn2O3, have attracted extensivescientific attention because of their large reserves, low cost and low 
toxicity [9,10]. However, MnOx usually suffer from difficulties in scale 
control, poor conductivity and the low material utilization rate, resulting in lower specific capacity and poor cycle stability [11–15]. One 
feasible method for improving the specific capacity of MnOx is to 
combine them with carbon-based materials [16]. In addition, the construction of a hierarchical structure can expose more electrochemically 
active sites, inducing faster interface electron transfer and promoting 
the reaction kinetics. However, the construction of advanced structures 
necessary for the improvement of the electrochemical performance of 
electrode materials is still challenging [17,18]. 
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted intense research 
interest due to their controllable structures, large internal pore volume 
and high specific surface area [19,20]. Due to these advantages, MOFs 
are often used as sacrificial precursors in the construction of metal 
oxide/carbon composites [21–28]. For example, Meng et al. used 
Fe-MOF to fabricate a Fe3O4/C composite as a supercapacitor electrode 
material, and a specific capacitance of 139 F g− 1 was obtained at 0.5 A 
g− 1 with 83.3% retention of the initial capacity after 4000 cycles [27]. Ji 
et al. synthesized Mn2O3 nanowires derived from a MOFs-coated 
three-dimensional graphene network, and obtained a capacitance of 
471.1 F g− 1 (0.21 F cm− 2
) at a current density of 0.2 A g− 1 [15]. 
Generally, most transition metal oxides prepared by traditional methods 
inevitably face the problems of poor conductivity and volume expansion 
of electrode materials during charging and discharging [11,29,30], 
whereas the hierarchically structured oxide/carbon composite material 
synthesized with MOFs as the precursors can not only enhance the 
electric conductivity, but also suppress the volume expansion during the 
charge and discharge process. 
Herein, we report for the first time a facile one-step route for the 
synthesis of hierarchical Mn2O3 hollow microspheres (Mn2O3-HMS) by 
the carbonization of the Mn-MOF sphere precursors. The unique structure of Mn2O3-HMS can shorten the electron and ion diffusion pathways 
and provide abundant redox active sites during cycling. Moreover, the 
introduction of oxygen vacancies adjusts the electronic structure for 
rapid electron conduction and ion diffusion. Benefiting from its structural characteristics, the supercapacitor with the Mn2O3-HMS electrode 
exhibited an ultrahigh specific capacitance, excellent cycle life and rate 
capability. "
158-intro.txt.txt,"Due to the continuous consumption of fossil fuels and the
aggravation of environmental pollution, the development of new
energy conversion and storage technology becomes more important [1]. For example, proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC)
[2], solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) [3], supercapacitors [4], have been
widely used in new energy vehicles which can reduce the use of
fossil energy, thereby reducing environmental pollution. Among
them, supercapacitor owns the characteristics of high power density, long cycle time, fast charge and discharge as an effective and
practical energy storage device [5,6]. Supercapacitors can be
divided into electric double layer capacitors (EDLC) and pseudocapacitors, of which pseudocapacitors involve surface redox reactions and show higher capacitance value [7e9]. Currently
pseudocapacitor electrode materials include carbon materials [10],
metal oxides [11] and conductive polymers [12]. As a kind of metal
oxides, perovskite-type oxides have been studied by many researchers because of their high conductivities and the accessible
oxygen vacancies [13]. Variable valence of B-site transition
elements in perovskite ABO3 oxides can improve electrical conductivity. In the process of reducing Mn4þ in La(1-x)CaxMnO3 to
Mn3þ, Mahata, A. et al. found that the conductivity was obviously
improved, which was suitable as electrode material [14]. The
accessible oxygen vacancies in perovskite oxides can provide an
anion insertion method for charge storage. Elsiddig, Z. A. et al.
studied the charge mechanism that oxygen ions intercalated in
oxygen vacancies and obtained that the specific capacities
increased from 411.8 C g1 to 727.6 C g1 with the increase of oxygen vacancy content [13]. Double perovskite oxides have also
attracted the interests of many researchers because of their special
structures, in which A-site or B-site ion is ordered. A-site ordered
structure has prominent thermal and chemical stability, high
electrical conductivity and oxygen kinetics [15]. For example, the Asite cation ordered structure of the double perovskite material
LaBaCo2O5þd is beneficial to adopt a high level of oxygen vacancies
[16]. The oxygen ion diffusivity in GdBaB2O5þx (B ¼ Mn and Co)
increased by orders of magnitude when a simple cubic perovskite
with randomly occupied A-sites transfers into a layered crystal
ordered structure [17]. Other double perovskite oxides such as
PrBaCo2O5þd (PBCO) also have the above mentioned characteristics.
Frontera, C. et al. reported that double perovskite PrBaCo2O5þd
oxides had excellent oxygen transport properties compared with
the perovskite oxide as solid oxide fuel cells electrodes [18].
However, the electrochemical performance and reactionmechanisms of double perovskite PrBaCo2O5þd oxides as supercapacitor electrodes have not been studied clearly.
In this paper, double perovskite PBCO oxides were identified by
X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) tests
were performed in KOH electrolyte to explore the electrochemical
performance of PBCO. Test results show that double perovskite
PBCO oxides have high specific capacitance and excellent cyclic
stability while using as supercapacitor electrode material"
159-intro.txt.txt,"Electrochemical capacitor (ECs) plays an important role in energy storage and efficiency due to its combination of high power
density with reasonably high energy density, which fills the gap
between battery and traditional capacitor. Naturedly, the storied
energy in EC is either capacitive or pseudocapacitive. A pseudocapacitor provides higher energy density that relies on efficient redox
reaction. And it also involves fast and reversible faradic surface
reaction for charge storage. It has been demonstrated that transition metal oxides are efficient at redox reaction for pseudocapacitors in respect of their various oxidation states [1e4].
As a potential material for pseudocapacitor, manganese oxide
has been intensively studied owing to its rich resources, low cost,
less toxicity and wide voltage windows. However, the practical
capacitance of manganese oxide is still very low as compared with
its high theoretical capacity (~1370 Fg-1); only 30% of its theoretical
capacity was achieved in most cases [3,4]. To address this matter,
various MnO2 forms have been examined ranging through nanosheets [5], nanowires/nanorods [6,7], nanospheres [8] and thin
films [9,10] etc. It is believed that some parameters are critical to
determine capacitance, rate capability and cycling stability, For
instance, particle size, morphology, crystallinity, specific surface
area and electrical conductivity. The capacitive performances of
MnO2 nanomaterials were also improved by adding highly
conductive, such as conducting polymers [11,12] and carbon materials [13,14].
A few reports have explored another approach to improve
capacitive performance of MnO2 by compositing with other materials. The composites have shown notable performance being
pseudocapacitor resulted from the synergic effect from their individual constituents [15,16]. TiO2 is a rich resource and cheap material with a higher electric conductivity compared with MnO2
(105
‒102 vs 106
‒105 S cm1
). TiO2 nanotube arrays (NTAs)
were studied for pseudocapacitor with respect to its large accessible surface area. However, most of the reports have shown
significantly smaller specific capacitance (100e911 mF cm2
) on the
TiO2 arrays [17e19]. To deal with the problem, TiO2 arrays composites were explored, a capacitance of 22.19 mF cm2 was achieved on TiO2/MnO2 nanowall arrays with a long term cycling
stability of 85% retention after 4000 cycles in a 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte solution [20]. TiO2/MnO2 NTAs structure has been accomplished via a pulsed electrodeposition technique attaining a
capacitance of 150.9 mF cm2 and a high energy density of 7.4 Wh
kg1 [21].
However, it is a critical to improve practical capacitance of MnO2
though massive researches were carried on MnO2 based materials.
When the higher crystallinity of MnO2 is, the lower surface area ibecomes [22]. In this work, our aim is to improve capacitance of
MnO2 by using hydrogen titanate nanorods as core to synthesize
TiO2/MnO2 core-shell nanorods due to its higher specific surface
area and higher electrical conductivity. The nanoflakes of MnO2
were densely grown on TiO2 nanorods by hydrothermal method
(Scheme 1). Meantime, TiO2 nanorods generated in-site from Htitanate nanorods. To our best knowledge, there are no reports on
TiO2 nanorod served as core to form TiO2/MnO2 core-shell nanorods. The TiO2/MnO2 core-shell nanorods have shown better capacity and stability compared with reports in literature"
160-intro.txt.txt,"As a fascinating energy storage system, supercapacitors (SCs) have 
attracted enormous attention in virtue of high-power density, fast 
recharge capability and long-term cyclability [1-4]. Based on the type of 
charge energy storage mechanism, SCs can be divided into two categories: electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) where charge is stored 
by charge accumulation using ion adsorption at the electrode–electrolyte interface, and pseudocapacitors that store charge by fast 
and reversible Faradic redox reactions [5-7]. Low energy density is one 
limitation for EDLC-based SCs and for this reason, pseudocapacitors 
with much higher Cs have received significant attention due to the 
substantially increase of charge storage connected with redox reactions 
can provide a higher energy density [8-10]. Since the performance 
metric of pseudocapacitors depends on the electrode materials, huge 
works have been performed to select suitable materials and further to 
optimize their structure and electronic valence to enhance the energy 
density [5,11,12]. Among a variety of pseudocapacitive materials, 
Co3O4, as one of the most promising candidates for supercapacitor, has 
attracted increasing interest due to its high theoretical specific capacitance, excellent reversible ability, low cost, abundant redox reactions 
and good corrosion stability [13-16]. It is well known that the electrochemical performance of pseudocapcitive-type electrode materials is 
mainly determined by the fast and efficient Faradaic redox reaction that 
take place in the surface and the first few nanometers beneath the surface of the electrode, where the highly active surface can afford 
adequate active sites for the insertion/de-insertion of protons and ions. 
[17], [18] However, the experimental Cs values are far less than its 
theoretical values, which are caused by poor intrinsic electronic conductivity that hinders the electron transport in the surface and nearsurface, causing the weak reaction kinetics, and limited utilization of 
electroactive Co3O4 [19]. Therefore, rational design of Co3O4 electrode 
material with excellent conductivity and efficient active sites is still a 
challenge for high-performance SCs. 
To save these problems, many approaches have been extensively 
explored. On the one hand, a strategy is to combine Co3O4 with 
conductive materials, such as another metal oxides, metals, carbon and 
conducting polymers, to form nanocomposites [19-25]. Nevertheless, 
the improvement of Co3O4 conductivity is within limits due to Co3O4 
phase maintain the intrinsic properties without change [17]. On the 
other hand, to change the electronic structure, giving abundant ion 
adsorption and promoting electron transfer, has a significant effect onenhancing the conductivity and boosting the specific capacitance of 
pseudocapacitance electrode materials [26]. The introduction of oxygen 
vacancy into metal oxides is an important route for increasing the specific capacitance by optimizing the electron structure to enhance the 
conductivity. For example, Zhao et al. synthesis oxygen vacancy abundant Co3O4 through the aldehyde reduction. Benefiting from sufficient 
oxygen vacancy, the Cs of Co3O4 is improved to 325.6 Fg− 1
, much higher 
than pristine Co3O4 (192.3 F g− 1
). [27] Wang et al. prepared an efficient 
Co3O4 nanosheets electrocatalyst by a plasma-engraving strategy, the 
etching process of catalyst explores higher surface area, and to generate 
oxygen vacancy, greatly ensured sufficient site for OER and improved 
the electronic conductivity, and shows a much higher current density 
and a lower onset potential compared with pristine Co3O4 nanosheets 
[28]. These results indicate that the introduction of oxygen vacancy is a 
useful method to increase electroactive sites, improve the contact area 
and enhance the conductivity. In addition, the nanostructured morphologies, including nanoparticles, nanowires, nanoribbons, nanorods, 
nanosheets, and hollow structures, are vital factors for the effect on the 
kinetic of ion and electron transfer for the capacitance performance 
[29]. Especially, one-dimensional nanowires/nanoribbons have been 
considered as promising candidates when used as electrode materials 
due to the reduced particle size and larger specific surface area 
providing more active sites. Since cubic Co3O4 with a normal spinel 
structure lacks the structural anisotropy of one-dimensional growth, 
there are rarely reports involving Co3O4 nanowires/ nanoribbons for 
supercapacitor [29]. Therefore, to construct one-dimensional Co3O4 
nanowires/nanoribbons with abundant oxygen vacancy is still an 
effective strategy for obtaining Co3O4 electrode material for high performance supercapacitor. 
Here, reduced vacancy-rich Co3O4 nanoribbons (R-Co3O4 NRs) have 
been prepared by a facile solution reduction process from Co3O4 nanoribbons, which are obtained by a self-temple conversion manner via selfassembly approach followed by a calcinating process. The morphology 
of pristine Co3O4 inheriting from the precursor (Co(MA)2 nanoribbons) 
is kept. Then a facile reaction of modifying the interfaces of pristine 
Co3O4 nanoribbons is carried out to obtain the vacancy-rich Co3O4 NRs 
by wet chemistry reduction with NaBH4. This unique interface can 
maximize the advantages to achieve more electroactive sites. The RCo3O4 NRs are the promising candidates as electrode material for 
supercapacitor. The Cs of the R-Co3O4 NRs reaches 464.9 Fg− 1 at the 
current density of 1 A g− 1
, which is 1.34-fold higher than that of Co3O4 
NRs. In addition, an ACS device based on R-Co3O4 NRs and active carbon 
(AC) is successfully fabricated, which displays a high energy density 
(18.6 W h kg− 1
) at the power density (400 W kg− 1
) and excellent cycling 
stability."
161-intro.txt.txt,"Current environmental issues and resource shortages require
efficient and reversible storage/release of electric energy through
the rapid development of devices like portable consumer electronics, electric vehicles, power grids, and wearable technologies [1–3].
Among energy storage devices, supercapacitors have attracted
increasing attention due to their high power densities, good safety,
and prolonged cycle stability[4]. However, supercapacitors still
suffer from low energy density, which is inferior to that of ion batteries[5]. On the other hand, hybrid energy storage systems composed of both supercapacitors and batteries are of particular
interest, especially for use in electric vehicles[6] and microgrids
[7]. Hybrid/asymmetric supercapacitors are often composed of different types of electrode materials. Accordingly, it is possible to
combine high energy density batteries with good power density
supercapacitors to meet the energy storage and practical needs
[8,9]. High energy density hybrid devices require wide potential
windows and high specific capacitances [10]. Smaller capacitances
of either the positive or negative electrode would limit the overall
specific capacitance of the device. Metal oxide materials, such as
Fe2O3[11,12], MoO3[13], V2O5[14], LaFeO3[15], ZnO[16], TiO2[17],
and Bi2O3[18–20] have widely been used thanks to their suitable
potential windows and higher capacitances than carbon-based
materials, and thereby could better match other metal/carbonbased-materials[21,22]. Among metal oxide materials, Bi2O3 is a
semiconductor characterized by high theoretical specific capacitance of 1370F g1
, suitable potential window, low toxicity, and
easy preparation[23,24]. Thus, Bi2O3 can be employed as an ideal
negative electrode material. The energy storage mechanism of
Bi2O3 consists of transformation between Bi2O3 and Bi[25]. However, despite the high theoretical capacity of Bi2O3, obtaining elevated actual capacity with excellent cycling stability remains
challenging. By comparison, face-centered cubic d-Bi2O3 contains
oxygen vacancies, and therefore holds more ion diffusion pathways. Nevertheless, the metastable phase of d-Bi2O3 can easily convert to a-Bi2O3 with fewer oxygen vacancies[26,27], resulting in
declined capacity. Additionally, the semiconducting nature of bismuth oxide materials yields poor electrical conductivity[22], leading to slow kinetics and poor rate capability.
The slow reaction kinetics of transition metal-based materials can
be solved by several methods like adjusting the internal structures of
the materials [28,29], constructing morphologies with large specific
surface areas [30,31], and forming complementary composite structures with other carbon/metal based-materials[32,33]. The introduction of oxygen vacancies could regulate the internal structures of
materials, thereby improving the intrinsic conductivity and electrochemical activity of metal oxides [34,35]. Consequently, tremendous
efforts have so far been made to improve Bi2O3 by introducing oxygen vacancies and building three-dimensional structures. To this
end, Bi2O3 has been treated by various processes to introduce oxygen
vacancies, including annealing[36,37] and reduction by various
chemical reagents[38,39]. The formation of oxygen vacancies could
achieve rapid ion diffusion and charge transfer, leading to high specific capacity and rate performance. However, direct synthesis of dBi2O3 containing high oxygen vacancies yields poor stability. Consequently, other approaches are required to stabilize the materials.
Besides, the formation of oxygen vacancies in a-Bi2O3 through chemical reduction or annealing is complex with low reaction yield. Also,
over-reduction of metal Bi could occur, negatively affecting the electrochemical performances. By contrast, the generation of oxygen
vacancies through electrochemical reduction is convenient for controlling the reduction degree and maintaining the material morphology [40]. Furthermore, the introduction of oxygen vacancies in
a-Bi2O3 by electrochemical treatment has not yet been previously
performed. In terms of morphology adjustment, Bi2O3 materials with
three-dimensional marigolds[41], microspheres [42], hollow prisms
[43], and core-shell structures[44] have successfully been obtained
by regulating the synthesis process. Such design strategies greatly
promote faster charge transportation and the utilization of more
active sites[45,46]. In addition, carbon fiber is advantageous in terms
of excellent electrical conductivity, good chemical stability, and can
alleviate the stress generated by volume changes in metal basedmaterials [16–17,47]. Thus, the use of carbon fiber paper as a substrate for in-situ growth could positively improve the electronic conduction and cyclic stability of Bi2O3 materials. As a result, stable and
high-performance Bi2O3 electrodes on ACFP can be obtained by
introducing abundant oxygen vacancies into a-Bi2O3 through an efficient and gentle electrochemical treatment method.
Herein, Bi(OH)3 microspheres were first directly grown on ACFP
surface and then transformed into a-Bi2O3 microspheres by cyclic
voltammetry (CV) method. This in-situ strategy yielded a-Bi2O3 with
rich oxygen vacancies on ACFP with improved electrochemical performance and stability by preventing the formation of unstable dBi2O3. The proposed electrochemical activation method was easy
to use and can quickly introduce oxygen vacancies in a-Bi2O3 when
compared to complex annealing and chemical treatment with low
yield. The introduction of high concentration oxygen vacancies in
a-Bi2O3 matched that of d-Bi2O3, while retaining the threedimensional structure to fit with ion diffusion. The obtained novel
electrode materials delivered high specific capacity reaching
906C g1 (251.6 mAh g1
) at 1 A g1 with an outstanding rate capability of 79.8 % at 15 A g1 and long-term stability of 73.2 % after 3000
cycles. The integration of ACFP/a-Bi2O3 negative electrode with
La0.85Sr0.15MnO3@NiCo2O4[48] positive electrode formed a hybrid
device delivering a high energy density of 114.9 Wh kg1 at
900 W kg1 and power density of 28800 W kg1 at 72 Wh kg1"
162-intro.txt.txt,"Supercapacitors (SCs, also known as ultracapacitors) have been 
considered as an attractive candidate of efficient energy storage devices 
in future and aroused intensive investigation due to their versatile advantages of high power density, rapid charge-discharge process and long 
cycle stability [1–3]. Generally, the whole performance of the SCs 
mainly depend on the characteristics of electrode materials [4–6]. 
Therefore, considerable efforts have been made to develop high performance electrodes for the SCs. Pseudocapacitive electrode materials, 
including transition metal oxides and hydroxides of nickel[7,8], cobalt 
[9,10], manganese[11,12], as well as conductive polymer[13,14] have 
been widely investigated for SCs. Owing to the reversible faradic redox 
reactions, pseudocapacitive electrode materials exhibit superior capacitance to carbon-based electrode materials [15]. 
Among multitudinous available pseudocapacitive electrode materials, manganese dioxide (MnO2) is regarded as one of the most promising electrode materials because of their low cost, high earth 
abundance, and especially, outstanding theoretical specific capacitance 
(1370F g− 1
) [16]. However, because of the intrinsic poor conductivity of 
MnO2 (10− 5 ~ 10− 6 S cm− 1
) and the weak accessible capability near the 
surface, the reported capacitive performance of MnO2-based electrodes 
is far below their theoretical capacitance, resulting in unsatisfactory 
application [17]. 
Various attempts have been devoted to improving the capacitive 
performance of MnO2, such as increasing the electroactive surface area 
and shortening the diffusion pathway of ion/electron by constructing 
hierarchical nanoarchitectures [18–22] or prompting the conductivity 
through integrating MnO2 with conductive constituents [23–27]. The 
capacitive performance of resultant MnO2-based composite electrodes 
were observably enhanced compared with original MnO2. Nevertheless, 
the outstanding performance of MnO2 was mainly achieved at relatively 
low mass loading (<1 mg cm− 2
), which is not meet the requirements of 
mass loading for practically adoptable levels ( ≈ 10 mg cm− 2
)[28]. As 
we known, the electrochemical performance of MnO2 electrodes 
decrease substantially with the increasing of mass loading and thickness, because of the electron and ion transport deteriorate with the increased 
mass loading and thickness of the electrodes. Therefore, the scale of 
high-performance MnO2 electrodes with efficient transportation of 
electron/ion and abundant electro-active sites into commercial-level 
mass loading remains a daunting challenge. 
As is known to all, interface engineering has been proved to be an 
efficient method to enhance electrochemical performance of electrode 
materials[29,30]. Recently, a novel strategy of defect engineering holds 
enormous prospect, which is considered as an effective route to achieve 
the favorable electrochemical performance of metal oxides electrode 
materials [31–33]. The introduction of appropriate defect can regulate 
the electronic configuration of adjacent atoms and generate lattice 
distortion in the crystal materials, thus improving the chemical properties or electrical conductivity of the materials, and then optimize the 
performance of the materials[34–36]. It is reported that the existence of 
oxygen vacancies in the MnO2 electrodes can adjust the electronic and 
electrochemical activity of inherent MnO2, which offers an important 
contribution for the promotion of electrochemical performance of 
MnO2-based electrode[37–39]. Herein, we developed an efficient 
strategy using N2-plasma treatment for defect engineering to fabricate a 
MnO2 electrode with high capacitive performance at high mass loading 
of 12 mg cm− 2
. First, MnO2 nanosheets and MnO2 nanoarrays grown on 
carbon cloth (CC) were assembled into cactus-like hierarchical structure. Then, the hierarchical structure MnO2 was treated using N2-plasma 
to obtain abundant lattice oxygen vacancies. The influences of N2- 
plasma on the phase structure, morphology, defect as well as electrochemical performance of synthesized cactus-like MnO2 were investigated. The results showed that the N2-plasma treatment can effectively 
tune the defect concentrations and electric conductivity of MnO2, and 
thus leading to a greatly enhanced capacitance performance. Particularly, the resultant N2-plasma treated MnO2 (N-MnO2) can deliver a high 
areal capacitance of 5 320 mF cm− 2 (443.3 F g− 1
) at 5 mA cm− 2
, which 
are superior to 3 220 mF cm− 2 (268 F g− 1
) of untreated MnO2. 
Encouragingly, the asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) based on NMnO2 and activated CC (ACC) achieved a high specific energy density of 
0.56 mWh cm− 2 (46 Wh kg− 1
) at a power density of 5.14 mW cm− 2 (420 
W kg− 1
). The impressive results demonstrate the defect engineering of 
N2-plasma treatment could inspire the design philosophy for the 
advanced electrode materials used in high mass loading asymmetric 
supercapacitors. "
163-intro.txt.txt,"With the continuous deterioration of the climate and the
increased consumption of fossil energy, clean and efficient
renewable energy storage equipment has received widespread
attention [1e5]. Among them, supercapacitors, a new type of energy storage equipment, have become research hotspots due to
their high-power density, long cycle performance, safety and stability, and environmental friendliness [6e10]. However, the low
energy density of supercapacitors severely hinders their practical
application. According to the energy density equation of E ¼ 1/
2CV2
, increasing the specific capacity (C) and widening the working
potential window (V) can be effectively improved the energy
density and then made it more applicable in the energy storage
area [11]. The construction of battery-capacitor hybrid supercapacitors by using different materials as positive and negative
electrodes is a useful way to widen working potential windows. For
improving the specific capacity, the useful way is to construct many
methods for improving the electron transfer rate and ion diffusion
rate in many kinds of positive electrodes [12e14].
Transition metal sulfides are usually used as positive electrodes
in supercapacitor. Co9S8 is a typical promising electrode because of
its many superior properties, such as high electrical conductivity,
hollow structure, and excellent redox reactions, and so on [15e19].
Although people pay more and more attention to Co9S8-based
electrodes, the specific capacity and cycle life of existed Co9S8based electrodes are still poor, which limits their practical application [20e24]. Due to superior electrochemical performance,
transition metal hydroxides are also usually used as positive electrodes in supercapacitor. Compared with single metal hydroxides,
polymetallic hydroxides have a more accessible oxidation state,
higher reversible capacity, better electrical conductivity and stability. It has been widely studied as a supercapacitor electrode
[25e27]. In recent years, due to its high theoretical capacity, high
stability, rich natural resources, and good environmental friendliness, nickel-cobalt double hydroxide (NiCo-LDH) has been attracted wide attention to researchers. For example, a Co3O4@NiCo LDH
core/shell nanosheet array on Ni foam is prepared by Zhou et al. and
used as an integrated battery for supercapacitors electrode. The
resulting composite exhibit high specific capacity (2676.9 F g1 at
0.5 A g1
) and excellent cycle stability [28]. Integrating Co9S8 and
NiCo-LDH as composite electrodes are also reported, but the electrochemical performance is still unsatisfactory because of the slow
reaction kinetics and limited electrochemically active sites. For
example, the combination of Co9S8 nanorods and NiCo-LDH reported by Jia et al. has improved the capacity performance to some
extent. The method of constructing an ordered heterogeneous
core-shell structure does improve the performance of supercapacitors, but it cannot improve the performance drastically, only
complements the advantages of several materials [29]. To solve this
problem, several methods have been explored. For example, surface
doping of transition metal hydroxides is considered as a method to
accelerate surface kinetics and improve electrochemical performance [30e32]. As recently reported, Guo et al. prepared Cu doped
NiCo LDH/CuO double arrays and used them as ultralong life hybrid
fiber supercapacitor. This multi-component hierarchical structure
helps to obtain a large surface area and greatly improves its electrochemical activity [33]. In our previous work, we inserted a polypyrrole (PPy) charge transfer layer into the middle of Co9S8
nanotubes and NiCo-LDH nanosheets to improve the electron
transfer rate and obtained dominant electrochemical performance
[34]. Therefore, exploring new methods to improve the electron
transport rate and ion diffusion rate is an effective way to improve
the electrochemical performance of Co9S8@NiCo-LDH NTAs.
Recently, there is a promising new way to improve the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors by introducing oxygen
vacancies. It can increase the electrochemical active sites, reduce
the resistance of the material itself, increase the electron transfer
rate, and thus improve the kinetics of the reactive materials. For
example, the electrochemical performance of oxygen vacanciesrich MnO2 (MnO2-X prepared by simple hydrogenation) nanorods
is significantly improved with large mass capacity, excellent rate
performance, and cycle stability, due to the conductivity is essentially improved by introducing oxygen vacancies, reported by Zhai
et al. [35]. In addition, Bi et al. prepared a vanadium pentoxide/
poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) nanocable with oxygen-rich
vacancies (VOeV2O5/PEDOT) through a one-step oxidation polymerization reaction of PEDOT. PEDOT is used to generate an
adjustable oxygen vacancy concentration in the surface layer of
V2O5, thereby greatly improving its electrochemical performance
[36]. As previously reported, the catalytic activity of NiCo-LDH can
be improved by the hydrogen reduction reaction [37e39]. Therefore, introducing oxygen vacancies on the surface of NiCo-LDH
nanosheets and constructing Co9S8@NiCo-LDH NTAs with rich oxygen vacancies (Co9S8@OV-CoNi-LDH) may be an additional effective way to further improve its electrochemical performance.
In this work, Co9S8 nanotube arrays in situ grown on flexible
carbon cloth, and NiCo-LDH core-shell heterostructure with rich
oxygen vacancies (OVeNiCo-LDH) is designed by the NaBH4
reduction process. With introducing oxygen vacancies, the conductivity is improved and the kinetics of the surface redox reaction
is accelerated, thereby its electrochemical performance is
improved. The electrochemical measurement results show that the
Co9S8@OV-NiCo-LDH NTAs can obtain a large specific capacity of
1335 C g1 at scan rate of 0.5 A g1
, which is more than four times
higher than that of the untreated Co9S8@NiCo-LDH NTAs electrode
and twenty times than Co9S8 electrode. Besides, using the prepared
Co9S8@OV-NiCo-LDH NTAs as the positive electrode along with the
negative electrode of AC, the high-performance flexible HSC device

164-intro.txt.txt,"Metal-oxide and rGO hybrid composites known for their novel 
physical and chemical aspects, have attracted lager attention due to 
their potential usage in energy storage, and catalytic applications [1–4]. 
Photo-electrocatalytic (PEC) and electrochemical (EC) aspects of these 
hybrids are receiving research interest considering the global demand 
for energy generation (e.g. Hydrogen Evolution Reaction: HER) and 
energy storage (e.g., Supercapacitor) [5,6]. The former section explains 
a promising pathway in direct conversion of renewable solar energy into 
storable chemical energy. Photo-electrochemical (PEC) water splitting is 
drawing continuous focus in the field of clean energy sciences since the 
first report on TiO2 photo-electrodes by Fujishima and Honda in 1972 
[7]. The PEC phenomenon is driven by photo response electrodes where 
H2 and O2 are produced separately which provides a promising source of 
hydrogen energy [8]. In general, the electrode consists of photo-induced 
holes in the valence band with better oxidation abilities, and the electron mobility exceeds that of the hole movement. This phenomenon 
separates the induced charge carriers (electron/hole), resulting the 
delocalized π* anti-bonding states in the conduction band [9]. 
The literature is observed with platinum (Pt) based electrodes for 
efficient water splitting reactions which could not be considered forlarge scale application due to the cost parameters. Hence, non-noble 
metal based electrodes have come into existence in replacing noble 
metal electrodes (e.g., Pt, Au). But, in most of the conditions, acidic 
environments are the pre-requisite to operate these non-noble metal 
based photo-anodes for HER, which are not highly photo-sensitive [8, 
10]. Thus, a reason to innovate high photo response non-noble metal 
anodes which can work in either near neutral and alkaline conditions is 
of high requiement now-a-days. Tungsten-based electrodes are also well 
reported (e.g., WS2) for visible-light-driven photocatalysis owing to 
their small band gap (1.4–2.8 eV) and better stability where manganese 
decoration improvised the PEC abilities [11]. But, in most of these systems the recombination of photo induced charges is dominated over the 
charge transfer phenomenon. High voltages are a prerequisite in 
attaining better conversion efficiencies, which might also result in 
recombination of charge carriers. 
A few recent studies focused on finding the insights in the recombination process, mainly on the role of in-gap states. A generally 
accepted analogy, one expects these in-gap states might act as trapping 
spots for holes, which results in their passive participation in the watersplitting reactions, eventually leading to hole-electron recombination 
[12]. In these aspects, 3d-transition metal systems might support better 
redox abilities of photo-anodes [13–15] compared to other systems (e.g., 
Pt, Ag, Si, W, etc.) in visible band where ‘Ti’ systems are mostly active in 
the UV band [16,17]. Thus, 3 d-metals (e.g., iron, manganese, cobalt, 
copper, zinc) might be probable, efficient and cost-effective photo-anodes in the visible band. A few studies already reported Fe2O3, MnO2, 
and CuO systems for a better photo electro catalytic activity [18–21]. In 
recent studies the importance of layer double hydroxides [LDH] of 
general formula [MII
1-xMIIIx (OH)2]
z+(Xn− )z/n⋅γH2O (M: metal ions, X: 
inter-layer anion), and multi junction metal oxide structures have been 
observed with efficient PEC reaction kinetics [22,23]. Apart from metal 
constituents, nano dimenssional organic counterparts (e.g., graphene, 
rGO, CNT, carbon dots) are also shown a significant impact on the energy platform due to better charge conducting/retaining behavior. 
Recently rGO structures have been verified for electrocatalytic and 
electrode applications due to some peculiar abilities of graphene (i.e., 
sp2 hybridization) [24–26]. Considering these aspects the research and 
development of hybrid structures (i.e., metal-oxide impregnated/infused rGO) drawn attention for PEC/water splitting applications. 
In this regards, unary/binary metal oxide impregnated carbon structures 
(e.g., rGO) have been reported for energy catalysis [27–29]. But, the 
usage of ternary metal oxides impregnated rGO has not been reported 
yet for PEC applications, as per the best knowledge of authors. Alongside, the doping of aluminium centres (p-type) in transition metal oxide 
systems, and alumina oxide anodes have been observed in emphasizing 
the photo/electrochemical aspects (e.g., oxygen vacancies) [30–36]. In 
this study, authors given an effort to discuss on PEC aspects of aluminum 
substituted manganese ferrite impregnated rGO (MAF-rGO) and 
aluminum substituted copper ferrite impregnated rGO (CAF-rGO) hybrids for possible water-splitting applications. 
Considering the synergistic aspects of hybrid structures, the current 
hybrids MAF-rGO/CAF-rGO are also verified as probable electrode 
material for supercapacitor applications. It is well known that electric 
double layer capacitor (EDLC) and pseudocapacitor electrode material 
possess certain inherent limitations. EDLC consists of materials from 
carbon family which shows excellent cyclic stability but deliver poor 
capacitance which decreases the energy density of the device [37]. On 
the other hand, pseudocapacitive materials undergo redox reactions to 
store a large amount of charge, hence deliver high energy density, but 
deliver poor material stability over repeated charge-discharge cycles 
[38]. In the present hybids, rGO is capacitive material which functions 
as (a) storing charge electrostatically at the electrode electrolyte interface, (b) preventing agglomeration of nanostructured metal oxides, and 
(c) providing sufficient electronic conductivity throughout the electrode 
material [38,39]. Apart from rGO, the presence of mixed metal oxide 
(Mn–Al–Fe/Cu–Al–Fe) acts as pseudocapacitive material which aims to 
provide high capacitance [40]. The synthesis of mixed metal oxide holds 
certain advantage such as (a) availability of variable oxidation state, (b) 
improvement of conductivity, and (c) generation of defects to active 
sites which promotes the adsorption of electrolytic ions. The corresponding energy storage parameters are evaluated in the present study 
using 3-electrode and 2-electrode modules. "
165-intro.txt.txt,"With increasing environmental pressure and energy exhaustion, 
people are becoming more and more environmentally conscious. Low 
carbon emissions have become the mainstream of the world [1–3], and 
the search for clean and renewable energy is overwhelming. Electrochemical energy storage is the most effective and economical method in 
many energy storage technologies [4,5], such as batteries [6,7], supercapacitors [8–11], etc., which are popular in research. Supercapacitors 
are expected to be widely used in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and 
modern electronic devices due to their higher power density than 
traditional batteries, fast charge-discharge property, and long cycle life 
[12–15]. Nevertheless, low energy density is the biggest challenge for 
supercapacitors, which directly limit their capacitance to power 
high-performance energy storage devices [16]. One the opposite 
extreme, the battery allows ions to be throughout the electrode material, 
providing a higher energy density [17]. However, given to the slowly 
diffusion rate of ions in the electrode materials, resulting in low power 
density [18]. More seriously, due to the diffusion of ions in the entire 
material phase, it is easy to lead to deformation of the material structure 
and the serious decline of cycle life [19]. To achieve the requirements of 
high power density and high energy density simultaneously, and to 
make up for the performance difference between supercapacitor and 
battery, a novel energy storage device-hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) 
came into being [20]. In a typical HSC device, the battery-type (i.e. 
faradaic) electrode produces a large energy density, while as the 
capacitor-type (i.e. electrical double-layer) electrode produces a high 
power density and the complementary advantages provide good electrochemical performance [21,22]. However, the design and preparation 
of battery-type electrode materials are currently available key factor for 
building up the high performance HSCs [23]. Therefore, the creation of 
high performance battery-type electrode materials has become an 
important problem in the practical application of HSC. 
Transition metal oxides (TMOs) are promising electrode material 
alternatives because of their theoretical specific capacity are much 
higher than commercial graphene (372 mAh g− 1
) [24]. Among these 
materials, due to high theoretical capacity (1006 mAh g− 1
) [25], stable 
structure [26], wide negative potential window [27] and non-toxic [28],α-Fe2O3 has paid increasing attention in supercapacitors industry [29]. 
Unfortunately, the poor conductivity of α-Fe2O3 limits the diffusion 
ability of ions between electrode materials and electrolytes, resulting in 
the obtained specific capacitance much lower than the theoretical value, 
and limited the practical application [30]. In order to address this issue, 
the methods of constructing nanostructures [31]/hollow structure [32, 
33] or composite with other materials [34] have been developed 
rapidly. For instance, Mohamed Racik K. et al. obtained the 
α-Fe2O3/MnO2 nanocomposite by hydrothermal and annealing α-Fe2O3 
with MnCl2. At the current density of 0.5 A g− 1
, the specific capacity of 
the composite was 108 mAh g− 1
, which is twice that of pristine α-Fe2O3 
(58.5 mAh g− 1
) [26]. Zhao et al. prepared Fe2O3 nanosheets grown on 
conductive carbon cloth by electrodeposition method, and the electrode 
material has better conductivity without conductive adhesive [35]. 
Nevertheless, these methods can only improve the electrochemical 
performance to some extent and cannot change the nature of Fe2O3. 
Recent some studies have demonstrated that the formation of oxygen 
vacancy is considered an effective route to increase the capacitance of 
electrode material [36–38]. Oxygen vacancy plays an important role in 
the electron modulation and surface characteristics of materials [39]. It 
can improve the conductivity, accelerate the ion transport and boost the 
electrochemical activity. Xiang et al. Reduced the pristine Co3O4 NSs by 
calcination at low temperature (H200–Co3O4 NSs) or immersion in 
NaBH4 solution (OVR Co3O4 NSs) to obtain two products with different 
oxygen vacancy contents. The specific capacity of OVR-Co3O4 NSs was 
3.6 and 2.6 times of the pristine Co3O4 NSs and H200 Co3O4 NSs at the 
current density of 1 A g− 1 [40]. Li et al. used nickel foam as current 
collector and nickel source, and the specific capacity of obtained NiO 
with abundant oxygen vacancies was 479.6 mAh g− 1 at 1 A g− 1
, which 
was close to the theoretical specific capacity of NiO [41]. However, 
there are a few reports in the literature that combine oxygen vacancy 
with α-Fe2O3, and it is necessary to develop a simple, controlled strategy 
for achieving vacancy-rich α-Fe2O3 to improve its application 
limitations. 
In this paper, we report the synthetic process of α-Fe2O3 octahedron 
with oxygen vacancy by a simple two-step calcining (TSC) method using 
Fe-MOF as the precursor. The strategy is safe, simple and universal. The 
oxygen vacancy is formed by calcining in air at first and then in nitrogen, 
resulting in a larger specific surface area and expose more active sties 
compared with the α-Fe2O3 through one-step calcining (α-Fe2O3 OSC). It 
was found that the specific capacity of α-Fe2O3 TSC was 250.2 mAh g− 1 
at the current density of 1 A g− 1 in 1 M LiOH aqueous solution and 
excellent rate capability. More attractively, the α-Fe2O3 TSC retained 
86% of its initial capacitance after 5000 cycles with repeated galvanostatic charge-discharge. Meanwhile, the hybrid supercapacitor was 
successfully assembled with activated carbon (AC) as positive electrode 
and α-Fe2O3 TSC as negative electrode. The voltage window of the AC// 
α-Fe2O3 TSC HSC was expanded to 1.8 V, exhibited an outstanding 
specific capacitance of 140.2 F g− 1 of 1 A g− 1
. By comparison with other 
reported HSCs, the maximum energy density was achieved 63 Wh kg− 1 
at the power density of 900 W kg− 1 as well as satisfied stability. This 
study paves a new route for the design and preparation of other metal 
oxides with oxygen vacancy. "
166-intro.txt.txt,"The discovery of new materials that possess electrochemical
properties suitable for development of renewable energy
systems is essential. Properties such as electrical conductivity
and charge storage are important to the operation of different
systems such as fuel cells, batteries, and supercapacitors.
In recent years there has been considerable effort dedicated
to the discovery of catalysts for water splitting,1−4 which are
motivated in part by the high cost of precious metal catalysts.5
While platinum is an excellent catalyst for hydrogen-evolution
reaction (HER), the search for more economical catalysts has
led to the investigation of a wide range of compounds from
carbides1 to borides,2 sulfides,3 chalcogenides,4 and oxides.6
Similarly, various classes of compounds7−10 have been
explored for the oxygen-evolution reaction (OER), such as
oxides,7,8 sulfides,9 and various nanomaterials and composites.10
In recent years, material discovery efforts have also been
directed to finding new materials for intercalation-based
pseudocapacitors,11 in particular those involving oxygen ion
intercalation, which was first shown in Nd1−xSrxCoO3.
12 A
number of oxide materials including LaMnO3 ,

La1−xSrxMnO3,
11,13,14 La1−xCaxMnO3,
15 SrCo0.9Nb0.1O3,
16
and LaNi1−xFexO3−δ
17 have been studied for oxygen anion
intercalation.
Among different classes of functional materials, the perovskite-based oxides, in particular those derived from oxygendeficient perovskites, show a wide range of interesting
properties, which can be utilized for energy applications. In
these ABO3−δ type materials, oxygen deficiencies result in
different coordination geometries for the B-site cations,
ranging from octahedral to tetrahedral and square pyramidal.18
The oxygen vacancies are sometimes distributed randomly.19
There are also situations where the arrangement of oxygevacancies is ordered.18 One of the common types of ordering
results in the so-called brownmillerite structure, named after
mineral Ca2AlFeO5. The structure consists of sequential layers
of tetrahedra (T) and octahedra (O), forming TOTOT..., with
A-site cation residing between the layers. The tetrahedra form
chains that are twisted in either left-handed or right-handed
orientation to yield several orthorhombic structural variants
adopting space groups such as Ibm2, Pnma, Pbcm, or Icmm.
18,20
The variation in the arrangement of oxygen vacancies and the
subsequent structural characteristics result in different types of
properties.
For example, the oxygen-deficient perovskites Sr2Fe2O6−δ
and CaSrFe2O6−δ show different types of vacancy order,
resulting in significantly different electrical charge transport.
Sr2Fe2O6−δ shows a persistent decrease in electrical conductivity as a function of temperature, whereas CaSrFe2O6−δ
exhibits an increase followed by a decrease in conductivity in
the same temperature range.18 In addition, magnetic properties
change significantly. In Sr2Fe2O6−δ, an incommensurate
magnetic structure is observed21 where moments are in the
spin-density wave state and are oriented perpendicular to the
body diagonal of the unit cell, whereas CaSrFe2O6−δ shows
long-range antiferromagnetic order, where the moments align
in the 001 direction.18 Another example is the effect of vacancy
order on sensor properties for oxygen, carbon dioxide, and
carbon monoxide sensing using oxygen-deficient perovskites.22
Furthermore, the electrocatalytic activity is significantly
affected by structure and ordering scheme, as shown recently
for a series of oxygen-deficient perovskites.7
While the brownmillerite type ordering is commonly
observed, there is also a similar, but less common ordering
scheme with the ideal formula A3B3O8 (ABO3−(1/3)), sometimes called the Grenier phase.23 This structure consists of
bilayer stacks of octahedra alternating with a single layer of
tetrahedra, i.e., TOOTOOT..., often adopting orthorhombic
space groups such as P21ma, Pbma, Pmma, and Pb21m.
24−27
The tetrahedral layer consists of corner-sharing tetrahedral
units that form parallel chains. The space group symmetry
depends on the relative orientation of these chains. The P21ma
space group adopts the cooperative twisting of tetrahedral
chains in the same direction.24 When the left-handed and righthanded orientations of tetrahedral chains alternate between
adjacent layers of tetrahedra, the structure crystallizes in the
Pbma space group.25 Finally, in the Pmma space group, each
tetrahedral chain orients opposite to all nearest neighbors
within the same layer and in the neighboring layers above and
below.26 Few studies of the properties of this class of oxides
have been conducted before.28,29 The structure and magnetoresistance of a material with composition Ca2.5Sr0.5GaMn2O8
have been studied,30 but no other information has been
reported. The same authors also attempted to make
Ca3GaMn2O8 but could not obtain a pure phase.30 In this
study, we report the synthesis, crystal structure, electrical
conductivity, magnetic properties, electrocatalytic activity, and
pseudocapacitive performance of two TOOTOOT... compounds, Ca3GaMn2O8 and SrCa2GaMn2O8, and show that
these two materials demonstrate a remarkable combination of
electrochemical properties that coexist in the same compound"
167-intro.txt.txt,"Due to global warming and the fast depletion of fossil fuels, the clean energy 
technologies have become an urgent need to replace the traditional fuel cells or lithiumion batteries. In order to satisfy the need for the next-generation consumer electronics, 
supercapacitors, also known as energy storage device, have recently attracted 
tremendous research attention because of their high power density (1-10 KW kg-1), fast 
charge/discharge rates (seconds), and excellent cycling stability (>10000 cycles).[1-5] 
Among supercapacitors, metal oxide based pseudocapacitors with faradic reactions can 
exhibit much higher energy density than electrochemical double-layer capacitors.[6,7] 
And the engineering of electrodes materials with different structures can further 
enhance the performance to satisfy the increasing demands for energy storage and 
conversion.[8,9] Among them, hollow nanomaterials, in particular those with 
functional shells and inner voids are promising for supercapacitor electrodes because 
of their unique architecture, such as well-defined walls, high surface area and 
permeability.[10-12] Recently, a variety of synthetic strategies have been reported to 
create hollow metal oxides nanomaterials, which outperform the solid counterparts and 
may contribute the sustainable development.[13,14] Among different methodologies, 
self-templating methods are most popular in controlled fabrication of hollow metal 
oxides due to the availability of involved sacrificial templates.[15-20] However, most 
of these metal oxides have poor conductivity, which restricts the ionic diffusion and 
electron transport and thus sluggish the performance and rate capability. 
Fortunately, ion doping is a potential way to ameliorate the inferior of metal 
oxides.[21] The doping ions could form a local built-in electric field around doping 
sites to change the state of charge distribution and accelerate the transport of ions and 
electrons.[22,23] However, when doping ions which are different with phase elements,

the crystal structure often becomes instability due to the mismatch of lattice 
dimensions.[24] Therefore, oxygen vacancies which do not introduce other elements 
are competitive candidates. Wang et al. developed a convenient and effective plasma 
surface engineering method to introduce the oxygen vacancies in electrodes, which can 
modulate the electronic and physical interactions and further result in the enhanced 
electrochemical performance.[25] Yang et al. developed the MnO hexagonal sheets 
possessing abundant oxygen vacancies through the reduction process, and further 
density function theory calculations demonstrate that the incorporation of oxygen 
vacancies significantly improves the performance.[26] And as previously reported, the 
introduction of oxygen vacancies in metal oxides shows several advantages: 1) oxygen 
vacancies which act as shallow donors can act as the electron carrier to improve the 
conductivity, which facilitates the electron transport and thus enhance the 
electrochemical performance;[27] 2) it can be believed that oxygen vacancies can 
contribute to the formation of built-in electric field around themselves at atomic level, 
resulting the acceleration of the transport of ions and electrons;[26] 3) oxygen vacancies 
with negative charges act as active sites to attract more positive particles, which can 
increases the ion diffusion coefficients in electrolyte;[28] 4) oxygen vacancies in active 
materials can change the contact interface between electrode and electrolyte while 
maintain the crystal stability due to the insignificant lattice mismatch between them.[28] 
However, traditional strategy to introduce oxygen vacancies, such as annealing method, 
is low efficiency because of the complicated, costly, and time-consuming reduction 
process.[29] Therefore, it is still crucial to design a facile and effective method to 
introduce oxygen vacancies to accelerate the transport of ions and electrons. 
 Recently  assembling asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) has served as the 
potential strategy to improve the energy storage performance of conventional supercapacitors. Traditionally, ASCs are always assembled with a positive electrode 
(metal oxide) with high capacitance and negative electrode (carbon materials) with high 
rate performance, which aim to narrow the performance gap between supercapacitors 
and lithium-ion batteries. According to the following equal: 1/CT=1/Cp+1/Cn, the total 
capacitance (CT) for an ASC can be calculated from the specific capacitance of positive 
(Cp) and negative (Cn).[30] In order to give full play to the performance of ASCs, 
researchers have paid tremendous efforts in matching positive and negative materials 
well with each other. However, in some reports, attentions were paid to design high 
performance positive materials, while the corresponding negative materials often used 
commercial active carbon (AC), resulting in limited overall device performance.[31,32] 
Therefore, designing proper method to achieve high performance of both electrodes for 
ASCs at the same time is still of great important.
Herein, inspired by the work of Liu et al. and Salunkhe et al.,[32, 33] both positive 
and negative electrodes of the ASCs were synthesized through ìOne for Allî strategy 
from one same template. Furthermore, we present a facile and effective oxygen 
vacancies engineering method to significant enhance the electrochemical performance. 
Specifically, we managed to synthesis triple-shelled MnO2 microcubes and hollow 
Fe2O3 microcubes from MnCO3 template, and introducing oxygen vacancies through 
NaBH4 treatment which could facilitate the electrons/ions diffusion at the interface. 
Significantly, due to the enhanced electrode kinetics, the oxygen-deficient MnO2 and 
Fe2O3 electrodes revealed significant improvement in both specific capacitance and rate 
capability. Moreover, an ASC was constructed using the oxygen-deficient MnO2 as the
positive electrode and oxygen-deficient Fe2O3 as negative electrode, which achieve 
high specific capacitance (240 F g-1), high energy density (133 Wh kg-1) and excellent 
cycling stability (90.9% after 5000 cycles) as expected."
168-intro.txt.txt,"As an efficient and sustainable energy storage device, supercapacitors (SCs) exhibit long cycle life, rapid charging and discharging capability and high energy density compared with
conventional batteries.[1–5] SCs storage energy utilizing fast surface redox reactions or ion adsorption.[6–8] Therefore, designing
and synthesizing electrode materials including abundant redox
sites and high specific surface area is crucial to boost the performance of SCs.[9,10] Transition metal oxides and hydroxides possess the characteristics required for high-performance
supercapacitors considered to be one of the most potential SCs
electrode materials.[11–13] Among them, two dimensional (2D)
layered double hydroxides with tunable structure and composition, large active area, and fast redox kinetics have been recognized
as more promising energy storage materials.[14–20]
Many efforts have been devoted to designing and synthesizing
binary/ternary LDH by combining the first-row d-block electroactive transition metals to obtain high-performance electrode materials[21–23]. For example, Wu et al. designed a novel flower-like
CoNi-LDH on carbon cloth using an in-situ hydrolysis process
obtaining 823 C g1 than pure nickel hydroxide and cobalt hydroxide.[24] Elgendy et al. synthesized a FeNiZn-LDH with high specific
surface area of 119.79 m2 g1
, achieving an energy density of 14.9
Wh kg1 at 1078 W kg1 and only 5% capacity loss ratio after 1000
cycles.[25] Although the SCs performance of d-block multicomponent LDH has been improved compared with singlecomponent LDH, its poor energy density (typically, less than 50
Wh kg1
) failing to satisfy the strict requirements of commercial
applications (cycle stability, high energy density and power density) due to limited redox sites and poor conductivity.[2,26,27]
In recent years, researchers have proposed doping nonelectroactive components to elevate the competence of SCs.[28]
For instance, transition metal LDH doped with non-electroactive
p-block Aluminum-LDH has been engineered and displayed potential for SCs.[29–32] Although the specific capacity of SCs has been
improved, the cyclic stability (usually less than 80% at high current
density after 5000 cycles) still cannot meet the demands of practical applications, possibly because the doped Al is unstable in alkaline electrolyte.[28,33] Compared with aluminum hydroxide, sblock metal hydroxides (such as Mg(OH)2) exhibit better stability
in strong alkaline solution, showing great potential to improve
SCs performance of transition metal LDH. Particularly, in a pioneering study, Mg(OH)2 doping can greatly enhance specific capacity
and improve cycle stability of Ni(OH)2.[28] Also, Mg2+ have similar
ionic radii with Ni2+ and Co2+ cations, which makes it easy for Mg2+
to form LDH with Ni2+ and Co2+.[34] Doping s-block metal hydroxides is expected to increase the specific capacity of transition metal
LDH while further improving its cycle stability due to the regulatory effect on the structure (active site, conductivity, electronic
structure, etc.). It is worth noting that there is still a large amount
of s-block magnesium and calcium resources that have not been
used, resulting in a serious waste of resources and environmental
pollution in the process of mining salt-lake resources [35]. Therefore, finding ways to enhance the utilization of magnesium is of
great significance to the sustainable development of human society
[36]. However, improving SCs performance of multi-component
transition metal LDH by doping non-electroactive s-block metal
magnesium has seldom been reported.
Furthermore, enormous researches have revealed that oxygen
vacancies have important effects on electrode materials, such as
augmenting active sites, accelerating the transmission of electrons
and improving the conductivity of materials.[35–38] For instance,
Jin’s group created the oxygen vacancies of CoAl-LDH with NaBH4,
which improved the energy storage performance of pristine CoAlLDHs.[39] Zou and co-workers demonstrated that the improvement of electrochemical performance is mainly originated from
the oxygen vacancies which aggrandize the electrode conductivity
and enhance the adsorption of ions in the electrolyte simultaneously.[40] Numbers of strategies have been developed to generate
oxygen vacancies, such as hydrogen reduction, plasma treatment,
NaBH4 reduction, and acid etching.[4,41,42] However, these traditional strategies may be difficult to control and may damage the
structure of LDH.[43–47] Own to its mild reducibility, magnesium
powder can generate oxygen vacancies at room temperature, and
act as a self-dopant during the reaction process, thereby further
promoting the generation of oxygen vacancies without destroying
the structure of the material [48,49]. Therefore, regulating oxygen
vacancies by magnesium powder to improve the performance of
supercapacitors should be deeply investigated.
Based on the aforementioned discussion, a novel strategy to
improve SCs performance of multi-component transition metal
LDH via sacrificial magnesium-based replacement reaction was
proposed. Mg2+ doping and mild reduction of magnesium powder
induce the generation of oxygen vacancies in ultrathin CoNi-LDH,
which enhances electrochemical charge transfer efficiency and
adsorption ability for electrolytes, hence increasing the conductivity and specific capacity. The self-made asymmetric supercapacitor
(ASC) CoNiMg-LDH//AC displayed high energy density (73.9 Wh
kg1 @ 0.8 kW kg1
) and only 13% capacity loss at an ultrahigh current density of 20 A g1 with 5000 cycles, which is superior to most
previously reported results of ternary component LDH. This work
extends the scope of superior SCs electrode materials, which helps
promote the large-scale application of supercapacitors in the field
of energy storage"
169-intro.txt.txt,"With the continuous development of small portable electronic
devices, micro-supercapacitor with small volumes and high storage capacity is unprecedentedly needed [1–3]. However, most of
the widely used powder electrode materials are challenged due
to the easily drop off from the collector during the charge–discharge process and complex preparation process. More importantly, the collector itself occupies a large volume [4–6].
Therefore, the selection of electrode materials with high-capacity
and self-supporting characteristics can overcome above shortcomings, which is one of the important means to obtain small volume
and high volumetric energy density hybrid supercapacitors [7,8].
Carbon nanotubes (CNT) have been widely used in supercapacitor electrodes due to their advantages, e.g., large specific surface
area, considerable electrical conductivity, thermodynamic stability, and environment-friendly [9,10]. More importantly, CNT can
be filtered into a membrane as a self-supporting substrate with
an interconnected conductive porous network structure and shortened paths for the electron and ion transportation [11,12]. However, CNT has a limited capacity and needs to be combined with
other high-capacity pseudo-capacitor materials to achieve a substantial increase in capacitance [13]. Therefore, a new type of
self-supporting electrode with high capacitance will be obtained
by combining carbon nanotubes with high-performance pseudocapacitor electrode materials [14,15]. Among many pseudocapacitor electrode materials, NiCo2O4 is a typical spinel mixed valence
metal complex oxide. In its crystal structure, nickel ions occupy
octahedral position, while cobalt ions are in both octahedral and
tetrahedral positions, which can provide two active centers for
electrochemical reaction. Thus, NiCo2O4 have better electrochemical energy storage performance than single component cobalt or
nickel oxides [16]. For example, Wu et al. reported a selfstanding NiCo2O4@carbon nanotube composite film electrode for
supercapacitors with the best electrochemical behavior of 1590 F
g1 at 0.5 A g1 (873 F cm3
) [17]. Recently, some studies showed
that the metal oxides with oxygen vacancy can effectively improve
the electrochemical activities of the electrode material, which is
beneficial to enhance the conductivity and improve the diffusion
of carriers, as well as the absorption of OH– [18,19]. A proper
amount of oxygen vacancy is conducive to the proton insertion
in active material and store more charges in oxidation–reduction
reaction, thus increasing the capacitance of the electrode [20].
Metal phosphide shows a narrower bandgap and generates more
active sites compared with transition metal oxides, accelerating
the faster electron transfer, promoting the redox reaction, and
leading to improved conductivity and electrochemical performance [21–23]. Thus, a combination of NiCo2O4 with metal phosphide will result in a synergistic effect and has been widely
concerned in the field of supercapacitor [24]. Jia et al. reported that
one-dimensional Ni2P nanoneedles within a three-dimensional
hierarchical NiCo2O4/Ni2P structure can effectively improve the
electrical conductivity and promote fast Faradaic reaction, exhibiting a high specific capacity of 2900 F g1 at 0.008 A cm2
, superior
to its single-component counterpart [25]. To the best of our knowledge, there are no reports of using NiCo2O4/CoP@CNTs composite
film with rich oxygen vacancies as a self-standing electrode in
energy storage system.
In this work, we demonstrate an in-situ strategy for designing
and synthesizing a self-supporting P-doped carbon nanotube (PCNT) intercalating with NiCo2O4/CoP core–shell polyhedron film.
NiCo2O4/CoP core–shell polyhedron derived from metal-organic
frameworks (MOFs) with rich oxygen vacancies showed satisfactory Faradic activity. P-CNT is employed as the substrate due to
its interconnected architecture and superior electrical conductivity, enabling generated electrons fast transport to an external circuit from the electroactive component. Benefitting from the
synergy effect of the two components, the self-supporting NiCo2-
O4/CoP@P-CNT composite film presents a maximum specific
capacitance, i.e., gravimetric/volumetric capacity of 1918.4 F
g1
/1074.3 F cm3 at 1 A g1
. Besides, a hybrid supercapacitor
based on NiCo2O4/CoP@P-CNT and P-doped CNT integrated graphene film is fabricated and presents a remarkable gravimetric/
volumetric energy density of 68.6 W h kg1 (41.8 W h L1
) at
800 W kg1 (488 W L1
). Moreover, the device also displays a good
lifespan with 84.2% retention after 8,000 cycles. The experimental
results show that NiCo2O4/CoP@P-CNT electrode has potential
application value in small and high storage capacity
supercapacitors."
170-intro.txt.txt,"In 2019, a new class of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19) 
infected the town of Wuhan in China. In March 2020, the World 
Health Organization’s (WHO) declared the COVID-19 as a pandemic 
after its spreading over 114 countries [1]. The WHO guidelines for the 
prevention and control of the COVID-19 recommends social distancing, 
school and workplace closure, travel restrictions and the strict wash of 
hands at all time. Further, the use of appropriate personal protective 
equipment such the face mask (surgical masks, KN-95 etc.) was highly 
recommended in order to prevent the SARS-CoV-2 transmission [2]. In 
addition, the rapid increase of the COVID-19 cases in the world generated an uncontrolled amount of medical waste, for example, the medical 
waste in Wuhan increased from 40 tons/day to ≈240 tons/day [3]. Also, 
the scientific community estimated that 129 billions of face masks were 
required for protection from the COVID-19 each month, producing a 
high environmental contamination by plastic residuals [4]. The WHO 
suggested disposal procedures for the face masks such as thermal 
treatment (steam sterilization and calcination) or the use of biocide 
agents to remove any pathogens in the face masks before their final 
disposal [5]. Thus, the generation of waste (specifically from face masks) 
derived from the COVID-19 pandemic has become a current problem 
[6]. For this reason, the scientists are currently looking for new 
eco-friendly technologies to use the waste produced by the face masks. 
These technologies should have preferably the characteristics of low cost 
and biodegradabilty, which have been shown by porous carbon, 
MnO2/reduced-graphene-oxide and by biochar/MnO2 synthesized from 
biomass. Those materials have demonstrated their reliability for the CO2 
uptake and Li+recovery [7–10]. A current technological device that is 
attracting the attention of the scientific community is the supercapacitormade with carbon materials [11,12]. It is considered as a feasible solution for the energy storage due to its properties of: i) high power 
density, ii) high coulombic efficiency, iii) long lifetimes, iv) good 
operational safety, and v) fast charge/discharge rates. In fact, all these 
features make the flexible SCs promising to substitute the lithium ion 
batteries (LIBs) and their use in flexible electronic devices [13]. Most of 
investigations focus on the use of metal organic frameworks (widely 
used for efficient solar cells and as solid catalyst), ordered mesoporous 
carbon and carbonized biomass for the development of SCs [14–21], but 
the research about the utilization of inorganic wastes for the fabrication 
of SCs is still scarce. Following this ultimate trend, Kalpana et al. [22] 
synthesized a carbon composite electrode from the waste newspaper and 
showed a maximum specific capacitance of 180 F g− 1 at 2 mV s
− 1
. The 
excellent performance of this material was due to its structure, surface 
morphology, large pore diameter and high surface area. On the other 
hand, waste printed circuit boards (PCBs) are difficult to recycle and to 
dispose due to the variety of metal and plastic materials composing them 
[23]. Although their disposal is a challenge, Rajagopal et al. [24] synthesized activated carbon (AC) with the high surface area of 700 m2 g− 1 
from waste of PCBs and characterized the electrochemical properties of 
such AC. They obtained the highest capacitance of 220 F g− 1 at 30 mV 
s
− 1 and a high energy density of 15.84 Wh kg− 1
. Further, the AC electrode showed a capacitance retention of 98% over 1000 cycles of 
charge/discharge. Another report indicated that the production of 
particleboard waste is constantly increasing, Shang et al. [25] synthesized a nitrogen-enriched activated carbon (N-AC) electrode from waste 
particleboard by a carbonized process (500 ◦C for 60 min) and a subsequent chemical activation with KOH. This N-AC electrode had a high 
surface area (1758 m2 g− 1
) and high nitrogen content (2.38 wt.%). The 
N-AC electrode produced a moderate capacitance of 263 F g− 1 at 0.05 A 
g− 1 and capacitance retention of 95% over 3000 cycles of charge/discharge. The waste tire is another big challenge for researchers because 
they are non-biodegradable and have a long lifetime. Nevertheless, Zhi 
et al. [26] synthesized AC electrodes by the pyrolysis and chemical 
activation processes of the waste tire. Later, they studied the relation 
between the porosity and the specific capacitance. From here, they 
concluded that the AC carbon with a mixture of mesopores and micropores produced the highest capacitance of 106 F g− 1 at 1 A g− 1
. 
Furthermore, Hu and Lin [27] developed a new method to obtain porous 
carbon electrodes from polypropylene face masks. First, the waste masks 
were sulfonated by a solvothermal method, next, employed as a source 
carbon and modified to a dense fiber porous structure after an annealing 
treatment (750 ◦C for 2 h under N2 flow). This carbon electrode presented a capacitance of 328.9 F g− 1 (at 1 A g− 1
). The solid-state SC made 
with such electrodes exhibited a low capacitance of 52.1 F g− 1 and energy density of 10.4 Wh kg− 1
. The capacitance retention was 81.1% after 
3000 cycles of charge/discharge. Thus, the solid state device had a lower 
electrochemical performance than the pure carbon electrode. In general, 
the SCs made with waste present until now the following disadvantages: 
(i) low/moderate capacitances, (ii) their electrodes are made with 
methods that require a high consumption of energy and time, since high 
temperatures are needed to carbonize the waste and surface activation 
processes such as pyrolysis are also required and (iii) the fabrication 
process of their electrodes utilizes KOH, which is a corrosive compound. 
Due to these last reasons, new ways to produce highly efficient supercapacitors using waste materials is still mater of research. 
As an effort to fabricate SCs from huge sources of waste and to reduce 
the environmental contamination caused by residuals of face masks 
(whose consumption has abruptly increased due to the COVID-19 
pandemic), we developed in this investigation a novel composite electrode by using recycled surgical face masks (those ones were used by the 
people for protection from the COVID-19 virus and later disposed). 
Firstly, the face masks were disinfected using a short UV treatment (UV 
light exposure at 250 nm for 2 min) and later, they were coated by a 
graphene ink to make the textile of the face mask (FMG) conductive (this 
saves energy because the carbonization of the face mask is not necessary 
as reported in reference 25 and this also avoids long activation processes 
for the SC electrodes). Afterwards, a thermoelectric material of 
Ca3Co4O9-δ (CaCo) oxide was deposited on the FMG electrode (FMG/ 
CaCo). Subsequently, the FMG/CaCo electrode was employed to 
construct the solid state supercapacitors. During their fabrication, the 
FMG/CaCo electrodes were encapsulated into empty blister packs 
recycled from the paracetamol packaging. It is worthy to mention that 
the CaCo oxide was selected as redox material for this work due to the 
following reasons: (1) it is chemically and thermally very stable [28]; (2) 
it presents high resistance to the corrosion [29]; (3) it is an oxygen 
deficient compound [30], thus, it should contain oxygen vacancies defects that can serve as redox centers for the charge storage; and (4) it 
contains cobalt, which is considered a redox element that easily changes 
its valence state. In fact, the CaCo oxide has been employed to make 
flexible thermoelectric films with a thermoelectric power factor (S2
σ) of 
100–232 µW∙m− 1
∙K− 2 [31]. The power factor produced by the CaCo is 
higher than that produced by the Pr2CoFeO6 (47 µW∙m− 1
∙K− 2
) but 
lower than that reported for Ca0.94La0.02Sr0.04MnO3 (374 µW∙m− 1
∙K− 2
) 
[32,33]. Also, the thermoelectrical materials are interesting because 
they can be combined with fiber textiles such as cotton, polyester, glass 
fabric, nylon and cellulose to make fiber-based thermoelectric materials 
with power factors as high as 2077.3 µW∙m− 1
∙K− 2 [34]. Then, the 
previous literature suggests that the thermoelectric materials can be 
coupled to textile fibers for applications related with generation/storage 
of energy. In our particular case, we are interested in energy storage 
devices. 
To the best of our knowledge, nobody has reported the fabrication of 
solid state SCs using at the same time recycled face masks and recycled 
blister packs from paracetamol packaging, only the electrochemical 
performance of a SC device made with face masks waste has been 
studied but its capacitance and energy density were very low (52.1 F g− 1 
and 10.4 Wh kg− 1
) [27]. Therefore, we fabricated in this investigation 
solid state SCs using surgical face masks and we found a high capacitance of 816.8 F g− 1 and energy density of 99.7 Wh kg− 1 for the SC made 
with electrodes of FM+graphene. When the redox material (CaCo) is 
added to the electrodes of the SCs, the capacitance and energy density 
are increased up to 1706.2 F g− 1 and 208.4 Wh kg− 1
, respectively. Thus, 
the capacitance and the energy density were increased by ≈108% and 
this occurred because the CaCo material introduced extra redox centers 
such as Co2+/Co3+ and oxygen vacancies defects, which served as actives sites for the charge storage. Interestingly, the SC made without 
CaCo exhibited a fast discharge time of 177 s, but the device made with 
CaCo showed a prolonged discharge time during 10 h at a stable/constant voltage of 0.54 V, which has not been previously reported. 
The results presented in this work demonstrated that recycled face 
masks obtained from the waste are useful to make highly efficient SCs. In 
this way, the contamination by plastics in the environment is reduced 
while devices able to provide energy are fabricated at low cost (since 
recycled surgical face masks and paracetamol’s blister packs were 
employed to make their electrodes and encapsulation). Hence, this 
research is a representative example about how to take advantage of the 
medical waste, which dramatically increased due to the COVID-19 
pandemic"
171-intro.txt.txt,"As a new energy storage equipment and component, supercapacitor exhibits many advantages over conventional storage batteries, such as superior cycle performance and high-power density 
[1–3]. However, their low energy density is still the obstacle to their 
application, the main challenge of supercapacitors remains to promote the energy density by enhancing the performance of electrodes 
[4–6]. To improve the energy density of supercapacitors, one of the 
most effective ways is enhancing the specific capacitance of the 
active substances. 
Metal oxide, with reversible or quasi reversible redox ability and 
the advantages of high conductivity, excellent cycle performance and 
high capacitance, is an important kind of pseudocapacitor electrode 
material [7,8]. Recently, some researches found that the oxygen vacancy of nanostructured metal oxides can effectively improve the 
specific capacity of the electrode material, which provide a new idea 
for the preparation of high energy density supercapacitor electrode 
material [9–11]. The increase of oxygen vacancy in oxides is beneficial to the diffusion of carriers in the material and the improvement 
of the conductivity of the electrode material [12]. Besides, as a kind 
of hole defect, the oxygen vacancy can cause the distortion of local 
crystal structure. A proper amount of oxygen vacancy is conducive to 
the proton insertion in active material, so that this active material 
can be used to store more charges [13]. In addition, the oxygen 
vacancy on the surface of the material is conducive to the absorption 
of OH-
, which can not only bring a small amount of electrostatic 
capacitance, but also promote the oxidation-reduction reaction, thus 
increasing the capacitance of the electrode [14]. For example, Zou’s 
group has successfully synthesized layered NiMn double hydroxides 
containing oxygen vacancies. The specific capacity of OV-NiMn-LDH 
is significantly increased to 1.6 times compared with the NiMn-LDH. 
The density of functional theory calculation shows that oxygen 
vacancies can provide more adsorption sites for electrochemical 
reactions, realize the rapid insertion and diffusion of ions, and 
significantly improve the electrochemical activity [15]. 
As we all know, metal oxides prepared by metal organic frameworks (MOFs) as precursors have the characteristics of large specific 
surface area, pore communication and surface hydrophilicity, which 
can be used as electrodes to promote the transport and diffusion of 
ions, thus obtaining higher electrochemical activity [16–18]. Recently, some preliminary results have been achieved in preparation 
of rich oxygen vacancy metal oxide electrode by using MOFs as the 
precursor. For example, Tang et al. have obtained Co3O4 nanoflakes 
rich in oxygen vacancy by oxidation of Co MOFs. The introduction of 
oxygen vacancy can effectively improve the electron and ion transfer 
at the interface between Co3O4 and electrolysis solution, and the capacity is increased to 2.8 times of the sample without oxygen 
vacancy [19]. Because of the various valence states of phosphorus, it 
shows metal like properties. Therefore, transition metal phosphide 
has higher conductivity and specific capacity than transition metal 
oxide/hydroxide, which making it is more suitable to be a candidate 
electrode for high performance hybrid supercapacitors [20–24]. 
Cobalt phosphide, as a kind of pseudocapacitor materials has been 
reported due to its excellent redox activity and high conductivity, 
high cycle performance, rich resources and environmental friendliness [25,26]. Therefore, it is an effect method to obtain high capacitance electrode materials by doping P in rich oxygen vacancy metal 
oxides. 
In this work, an effective ZnCo-MOFs derived approach is proposed to construct P-doped ZnCo2O4 nanosheets with rich oxygen 
vacancy coated on the surface of N-doped carbon. P-doped ZnCo2O4 
nanosheet arrays show a high surface-to-bulk ratio and anisotropic 
structure, which is beneficial to increase the utilization of active 
materials and shorten the electron/ion diffusion path. Benefiting 
from the synergy between components and structural advantages, 
the novel composites can reach a highest capacitance of 1581.5 F g−1 
at 1 A g−1. An asymmetric supercapacitor assembled by P-doped 
ZnCo2O4 and activated carbon as the positive and negative electrode, 
respectively, the device provides a substantial energy density of 
47.8 Wh kg−1 and power density of 800 W kg−1 within a broad operating potential window of 1.6 V. Besides, the supercapacitor also 
exhibits an outstanding stability of nearly 90.6% retention after 5000 
cycles. "
172-intro.txt.txt,"Fe2O3 is one of the most popular materials for supercapacitors
because of its low cost, non-toxicity, earth-abundance and high
theoretical capacitance [1–5]. However, the low conductivity
undermines its overall effectiveness to deliver high performance
thus greatly hinders its practical application [6–13]. To address this
issue, rationally designed composite electrodes based on carbonaceous nanomaterials have been utilized. For example, Guan et al.
developed a hierarchical graphite foam-carbon nanotube framework coated with a thin layer of iron oxide (GF-CNT@Fe2O3), whichshows a high energy density of approximately 74.7 Wh kg1 at a
power of approximately 1400 W kg1 [14]. Cheng et al. prepared
a three-dimensional a-Fe2O3/carbon nanotube (CNT@Fe2O3)
sponge electrode with significantly improved specific capacitance
of above 300 F g1 [15]. Besides, nanostructuring is also demonstrated as a useful approach to improve electrochemical performance. Yang et al. have designed and fabricated asymmetric
supercapacitor (ASC) with amorphous Fe2O3 nanotubes on flexible
carbon fabric, with a high energy density of 0.55 mWh cm3 and
good rate capability [16]. Besides, some researchers have applied
the doping method for boosting the capacitive performance. For
instance, Zeng et al. have designed Ti-doped Fe2O3@PEDOT core/
shell anode with a remarkably high areal capacitance of
1.15 F cm2 [17]. Nevertheless, it still remains a challenge to
improve the intrinsic conductivity of Fe2O3 effectively.
Creating oxygen vacancies (Vo) is regarded as a promising
approach to address the issues mentioned above since it can effectively improve the conductivity of metal oxides without introducing other elements [18–29]. Oxygen vacancy is an intrinsic defect
in metal oxide semiconductors, which plays a vital role in tuning
their electronic and surface properties. It can not only enhance
the conductivity and donor density but also improve the surface
features of the metal oxides, thus enables electrolyte ions and electrons transport, facilitates rapid redox processes at the metal
oxides/electrolyte interfaces. Zhai et al. have introduced Vo into
Fe2O3-anchored graphene by immersing it in 1 M NaBH4 solution
and found that the oxygen-vacancy-tuned Fe2O3 surface dramatically enhances the absorption of SO3
2 anions that majorly increase
the surface pseudocapacitance [30]. Chi et al. have designed
oxygen-deficient Fe2O3 with an areal capacitance of 694 mF cm2
,
which is higher than the untreated Fe2O3 (572 mF cm2
) [31]. Liang
et al. reported PH3 plasma-activated a-Fe2O3 with higher areal
capacitance (340 mF cm2
) than the pristine (66 mF cm2
) [32].
Oxygen-deficient a-Fe2O3 nanorods have been designed and
showed enhanced electrochemical performance compared to pristine a-Fe2O3 [33]. Oxygen-vacancy engineered Fe2O3 nanoarrays
have recently been designed to boost the capacitive performance
[27]. These researches demonstrate that Vo is sufficient to improve
the electrochemical performance of Fe2O3. However, they have not
illustrated the content of Vo and to what extent the Vo can
enhance electrochemical performance.
Herein, we take an insight into the effect of different vacancy
content in Fe2O3. The content of Vo was tuned by post-annealing
in Ar atmosphere at a temperature ranging from 200 C to 500 C
and analyzed by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). EPR is sensitive to Vo, and
we found that by increasing the annealing temperature, the intensity of the Vo signal is accordingly increased. The exact contents of
Vo were obtained by analyzing the O 1s fine spectra, where Vo
increases from 11% to 26% as temperature increases. Remarkably,
we found that the Vo increases as the temperature rises, but the
specific capacity shows a volcano curve, demonstrating a moderate
amount of Vo endows the best enhancement to the electrochemical performance of Fe2O3."
173-intro.txt.txt,"To better utilize the renewable energy, various potential energy
storage and conversion devices have been developed, include Lithiumion batteries (LIBs), supercapacitors and fuel cells [1–4]. Especially,
supercapacitors are the one of the most attractive in the research, attributed to their higher power density than batteries and higher energy
density than traditional capacitors [5–9]. Binary metal oxides are featured with relative higher specific capacitance, better structure stability
and electric conductivity, and are considered to possess both their advantages. Among different binary transition metal oxides, nickel cobaltite (NiCo2O4) is having one of the most success in supercapacitors
applications [10]. NiCo2O4 not only benefits from its wonderful electrical conductivity and superior electrochemical activity but also has
some advantages such as low cost, natural abundance, environmental
safety and low toxicity [10,11].
Nevertheless, it is reported that NiCo2O4 still suffers from low capacitance and poor rate performance due to their high dependence on
surface faradaic redox reactions and ion diffusion. To improve the
aforementioned performances, usage of hollow metal oxide microstructures is one of most attractive solution strategies. It was reported
the hollow micro-/nanostructured architectures with high surface area
would not only supply more electrochemical sites to increase the capacitance, but also significantly enhance ion diffusion with shortened
pathway to improve the rate performance [12,13]. Moreover, introduce
of oxygen vacancies was believed to improve electrochemical properties in many application fields, such as electrical water splitting and
supercapacitors [14,15]. Thanks to the formation of oxygen vacancies,
it will enhance the diffusion for charge carriers, adsorption of OH− and
serve as active sites for redox reactions [16,17]. It could be easilyinferred that combination of the two strategies will further improve the
supercapacitor performances. However, NiCo2O4 benefiting from the
synergistic effect of oxygen vacancy and hollow microspheres were
rarely reported. In addition, up to now, wet-chemical routes as main
candidate, such as hydrothermal/solvothermal [18], precipitation [19],
sol-gel [20], have been tried for preparing NiCo2O4 materials as electrodes. They are suitable for adjusting morphologies and introducing
oxygen vacancies by some extra treatments, but some limitations were
still observed, including time-consuming and multiple-steps. Moreover,
from the NiCo2O4 nanopowder to prepare the final electrodes, the usage
of binder would also hinder the transportation of electrons and the
diffusion of ions and damage the stability of electrical performances
[21–23].
Therefore, in this work, the oxygen-vacancies microspheres composed NiCo2O4 electrodes will be prepared. Besides, a novel rapid
fabrication route featured with one-step and binder-free will be also
employed, called as Solution Precursor Thermal Spray (SPTS) technology. In the SPTS route, the injected precursor solutions as feedstock
would be heated and accelerated by different heat sources to stack-up
and directly form the final films [15,24]. Herein, both the direct-current
(DC) plasma and oxyacetylene flame were employed as heat sources
with different spray torches, corresponding to the Solution Precursor
Plasma Spray (SPPS) and Solution Precursor Flame Spray (SPFS) routes.
During the deposition via SPPS and SPFS route, the feeding precursor
solution droplets went through a series of physical and chemical processes, including break-up and evaporation, precipitation, pyrolysis and
crystallization [25]. It should be noted that the whole duration of depositing suitable metal oxide films was within several minutes without
binders. It will not only present the significance of scientific research
but also will bring potential industrial prospects. The solution precursor
flame spraying (SPFS) possess a high working temperature (> 3000 °C)
and a large cooling rate (> 10ˆ3 K/s), as well as a reducing acetylene as
working gas [26,27]. Similar with our previous studies about oxygendefective ZnO [28], thanks to the type non-equilibrium feature route
and usage of reducing gas, oxygen vacancies are capable to be in-situ
introduced into NiCo2O4 films during deposition procedures without
any post-treatments.
Moreover, to our best knowledge, the NiCo2O4 films deposited by
SPFS and SPPS routes for supercapacitors have not been reported yet.
Oxygen-deficient NiCo2O4 films composed of hollow microspheres were
also firstly prepared. The characterization of these NiCo2O4 films in
terms of microstructures and compositions were conducted by SEM,
GIXRD (grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction), Raman and XPS analyses.
The oxygen-deficient NiCo2O4 microspheres films as electrodes exhibit
good capacitance (902 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g) and excellent
cycling stability (89.2% capacitance retention after 2500 cycles under
20 mV/s scan rate)"
174-intro.txt.txt,"Supercapacitors, also known as electrochemical capacitors (ECs),
have been intensively investigated, because of their higher power
density, good rate capability, and exceptional cycle life, which bridge
the power-energy gap between batteries and conventional capacitors
[1–5]. Among various factors affecting the performance of supercapacitors, electrode materials play an important role [6]. Many works
so far have focused on a variety of transition metal oxides (NiO, MnO2,
Co3O4, TiO2 and V2O5) [7–11]. Particularly, MnO2 has attracted much
attention due to its outstanding merits, such as low cost, natural
abundance, high theoretical capacity (˜1370 F g−1), environmental
friendliness, and wide potential range in mild electrolyte [12]. However, the major challenge for MnO2 electrode materials is the low
conductivity, which significantly hinders its practical applications [13].
In order to improve the electrochemical performance of MnO2 electrode
materials, enormous efforts have been made to construct nanostructure
MnO2-based composite, especially with highly conductive carbon materials, such as MnO2-carbon nanotubes [14], MnO2-graphene [15–17],
MnO2-porous carbon [18], MnO2-carbon nanofiber [19], and MnO2-
carbon nanofoam or aerogel [20]. MnO2-graphene nanocomposite has
motivated extensive efforts due to graphene’s large theoretical specific
area, high electrical conductivity, and good stability. Reducing GO is a
critical process in MnO2-graphene nanocomposite synthesis. Most reducing of GO are usually fulfilled by chemical reducing agents, such as
hydrazine [21], sodium borohydride [22], and benzylamine [23],
which are highly toxic and explosive. The reduction of GO by the
thermal method is a friendly method without using any hazardous reductants [24]. Zhang et al reported a facile, low cost, and fast reduction
method by the thermal decomposition of GO in air at low temperature
of 300 ℃ in a short time [25]. To our surprise, Wang’s group synthesized a reduced graphene oxide/mixed-valence manganese oxide (rGO/
MnOx) composite reduced by hydrazine vapor in situ. At the same time
MnO2 components were partly reduced to the low valence manganese
oxides. The obtained rGO/MnOx electrode material exhibited the superior specific capacitance, rate performance, and especially long cycle
life, which were attributed to the excellent electron and ion transport,
coexistence of mixed-valence manganese species, and synergistic effect
between rGO and MnOx components in the electrode material [26].
Another strategies to enhance the electrical conductivity and electrochemical properties of MnO2 are inducing oxygen vacancies [27–29] or
heteroatoms [30–32]. For example, Zhai et al prepared oxygen-deficient MnO2 by hydrogenation treatment which showed a large areal
capacitance of 449 F g−1, excellent rate capability and cycling stability,
and believed that the moderate concentration of oxygen vacancies had
a crucial effect on the electrochemical activity of MnO2 [33]. Oxygen
vacancies are also generated by a simple heating MnO2 in Air, N2, and
Ar [27,34]. Sun et al treated clew-like MnO2 under N2 atmosphere at
the temperature 300–700 ℃ [34]. The sample annealed at 400 ℃ exhibited the maximum specific capacity (368.2 F g-1) at 1 A g-1. The effect of oxygen nonstoichiometric on ORR electrocatalysis were also
investigated combining the theory calculations and experiments [35].
The concentration of oxygen vacancies can be regulated by the calcination temperature and atmosphere. A modest concentration of oxygen
vacancies are beneficial to boost the catalytic activity and durability.
Identical studies were also conducted in enhancing the electrochemical
performance of α-Fe2O3 [8,36], Co3O4 [37–39], et al. In those approaches, the different phase structures, such as Mn3O4 and Mn2O3, are
usually formed due to the removal of lattice oxygen, and lead to the
coexistence of multivalent Mn. So it remains challenging to develop the
highly active MnO2-based materials with the stable phase structure.
Inspired by these challenges, we explore an efficient, convenient
and scalable technology for preparing rGO/MnOx composite for high
performance supercapacitor via a thermal treatment in air at 300 ℃.
The thermal treatment in air not only renders the reduction of GO to
rGO in situ, but also forms rGO/MnOx composite. Meanwhile, oxygen
deficiencies are introduced into MnO2 sample. It must also be mentioned that the reduction of GO would lead to form the higher concentration of oxygen vacancies in rGO/MnOx sample than MnOx sample
under the same treatment condition. Another interesting finding is that
the crystal structures of MnOx and rGO/MnOx sample don’t change and
remain the same phase structure with MnO2 sample. In other words, the
new phase, such as Mn3O4 and Mn2O3, don’t form during the removal of
lattice oxygen under these relatively mild conditions. RGO/MnOx
sample exhibits a high specific capacity, and super long-life stability."
175-intro.txt.txt,"In recent years, one-dimensional nanostructures [1], such as
nanorods, nanotubes, nanowires and nanofibers, have attracted
much more attention for the application in energy storage devices
compared to their bulk counterparts. One-dimensional nanostructures offer efficient charge transport pathway and large specific surface area. TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNAs), as one of the typical
one-dimensional nanostructures, have received much interest in
photocatalysis [2,3], solar cells [4], lithium-ion batteries [5] and
biosensors [6]. In addition, TNAs are considered to be one of the
promising materials for energy storage electrodes [7], their highly
ordered nanotube arrays grew from highly conductive Ti substrate
can not only reduce the electrical resistance, but also offer direct
electrons and ions transfer pathways and easier access for ions
penetration compared to their non-oriented counterparts,
furthermore, the morphology of TNAs (length, wall thickness and
diameter) can be easily controlled. Therefore, TNAs are extraordinarily suitable for the application in energy storage electrodes.
Nevertheless, the pristine TNAs have suffered from poor electrical properties resulting from their semi-conductive nature [8].
Recently, pertinent endeavors have been devoted to overcoming
their poor electrical conductivity and low electrochemical activity
to make TNAs more suitable for battery-type electrodes, such as
thermal hydrogenation [9], electrochemical treatments [10,11],
metallic and nonmetallic doping (Au, Pt, Ag, C, N) [7,12e15]. However, some modification methods involve two or more steps with
high-temperature treatment or dangerous atmosphere, or cause
the destruction of the highly ordered structure of TNAs, resulting in
the separation of nanotube arrays and Ti substrate, so their further
utilization has been limited. What is more, most of the reported
works were focused on the introduction of only one phase, such as
oxygen vacancies (Ti3þ defects), C or N, therefore, it is more
attractive to introduce two or more active phases in one step, which
could greatly simplify the experiment process and also make an
improvement of the desired properties. Interestingly, according to
our previous work [15], two kinds of active phases, carbon and
oxygen vacancies (Ti3þ defects), could be formed through one-step
calcination process in Ar atmosphere. Compared with traditional
carbon coating [16,17] or oxygen vacancies (Ti3þ defects) introduction processes mentioned above, it is much more effective to
modify with both carbon and oxygen vacancies (Ti3þ defects) just in
one calcination step, in which the anodized TNAs can be annealed
and transformed into pure anatase phase at the same time, and the
electrochemistry property of the resulted m-TNAs render an 83
times enhancement of the areal capacitance over that of the defectfree TNAs electrodes [15]. Therefore, on the one hand, the onedimensional geometry of nanotube arrays could provide short
path for ion diffusion and charge transfer, on the other hand, the comodification of carbon and oxygen vacancies (Ti3þ defects) make a
great improvement of the electrical conductivity and electrochemical activity, thus m-TNAs are much more suitable to be used
as the energy storage electrodes than their pristine counterparts.
In order to further improve the electrochemical properties of mTNAs, numerous of attempts on the deposition of active materials
onto TNAs have been made. Because of low cost and benign environmental compatibility, various metal oxides or hydroxides, such
as NiO [18,19], Co3O4 [20e22], MnOx [23], NiCo2O4 [24], Ni(OH)2
[25], Co(OH)2 [26], have been employed as the electrode materials
for battery-type electrodes. Recently, transition metal sulfides
[27e31], including cobalt sulfides, nickel sulfides, or metal sulfides/
oxides hybrids derived from element S replaces part of O in metal
oxides, have been investigated as novel battery-type electrode
materials with improved electrochemical performance because of
their enhanced electrical conductivity and higher specific capacity
than those of their corresponding metal oxides mentioned above. In
addition, compared with binary metal sulfides, mixed metal sulfides, especially ternary metal sulfides with two different metal
cations, have attracted more attention due to their higher electrochemical activities and enhanced electrical conductivity. Especially,
nickel cobalt sulfides with different molecular formulas, such as
NiCo2S4 [32], Ni2CoS4 [33], Ni1$5Co1$5S4 [34] and (Co, Ni)3S2 [35], are
promising active materials which always exhibit much more
possible ways for the reversible Faradic reactions and further lead to
remarkable electrochemical capacity. However, there are several
drawbacks of nickel cobalt sulfides based materials: (1) instability: it
is well known that nickel cobalt sulfides are limited to be further
used because of their poor stability caused by the structural
degradation through the redox process. According to the available
reports, one of the effective strategies is to combine them with
carbon materials with high conductivity and structural stability,
such as graphene, carbon nanotubes [36], to improve the electrochemical properties of metal sulfides. For example, Qiu and coworkers [37] synthesized nickel-cobalt-sulfide nanoparticles decorated graphene hybrid composites with high electrochemical performance. This hybrid presented a high specific capacity of
725.5 C g1 at a current density of 3 A g1
, which was attributed to
the improvement of conductivity and structural stability by graphene, nevertheless, the application of this kind of composite is still
been impeded because of the high cost of graphene; (2) complication of formation process: formation of corresponding precursors
and followed by the subsequent sulfuration process to get the
desired mental sulfides. According to the existing literature, there
are two main sulfuration methods, calcination in H2S atmosphere or
hydrothermal treatment in Na2S solution, for instance, Lin's group
[33] prepared hollow NiCo2S4 nanoboxes by calcinating the Ni-Co
precursors in H2S ambient at 300 C for 2.5 h at a heating rate of
3.3 C min1
. The resultant Ni-Co sulfides demonstrated a high
specific capacity of 794.0 C g1 at the current density of 2 A g1
. Zeng
and co-workers [38] constructed nickel-cobalt sulfide nanosheets
through the micelle-confined growth of precursors and subsequent
sulfuration in Na2S solution. A specific capacity of 652.0 C g1 was
achieved at a current density of 2 A g1
. Obviously, these multi-step
treatment process increases the experimental cost and duration; (3)
using of binders: some reported nickel cobalt sulfides-based electrodes are commonly binder-enriched electrodes made by the
traditional slurry-coating technique, which could form “dead surface” and also block the contact between electrolyte and electroactive materials, resulting in the poor Faradaic reactions in the
energy storage process [39]. Therefore, it is much attractive to obtain
binder-free nickel cobalt sulfides electrodes with high performance
and stability by a simple one-step process.
Herein, we report the synthesis of Co0$12Ni1$88S2@Co8S9 nanoparticles decorated highly conductive TNAs by a simple one-step
electrodeposition process. The as-fabricated m-TNAs could be
directly used as the three-dimensional backbones to support CNCS
nanoparticles, and the loading mass of CNCS nanoparticles on mTNAs could be adjusted by the electrodeposition cycles. What is
more, there is no need of any binders when assembling the batterytype electrodes. By the synergistic effect of m-TNAs and CNCS
nanoparticles, the CNCS/m-TNAs electrode with electrodepositing
of 10 cycles (CNCS/m-TNAs-10) yields a remarkably specific capacity of 680.1 C g1 at a current density of 2 A g1
, and excellent
cycling stability with only 12.3% capacity loss after 3000 GCD test.
After constructing the asymmetric supercapacitor device with
active carbon (CNCS/m-TNAs-10//AC), a high energy density of
45.5 Wh kg1 could be achieved at a power density of 400.5 W kg1
.
This work demonstrates that the self-supported and binder-free
CNCS/m-TNAs electrodes should be promising and competitive
candidates for high performance battery-type electrodes."

societies will have to rely on sustainable and regenerative energy 
sources for development. Therefore, electrocatalysts/electrodes for 
hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and supercapacitors (SCs) have 
drawn great attention [1–6]. Despite precious outstanding electrocatalysts/electrodes, such as IrO2 and RuO2, indicate superior electrochemical behavior, their widespread commercial application is 
restricted on account of high cost and poor conductivity. Hence, 
developing the excellent property and low-cost functional materials and 
enhancing the sluggish kinetics, are still the strong desires. 
NiCo2O4 has been conceived as an attractive class of electrocatalyst/ 
electrode materials featuring with decent electrochemical performance, 
inexpensive and tailorable electronic structures. Recently, researchers 
focused on the design and fabrication of NiCo2O4-based materials with 
relatively low cost and favorable catalytic activity to achieve optimized

with palladium nanoparticles on nickel foam for hydrogen evolution 
reaction, the overpotential of Pd/NiCo2O4/NF is 69 mV at 10 mA/cm2 
[10]. Lei et al. proposed a novel nanoforest-like NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu 
heterojunction for overall water splitting, the resulting NiCo2O4/CuxO/ 
Cu achieved a current density of 10 mA/cm2 at small overpotential of 92 
mV [11]. Sivakumar et al. fabricated NiCo/NiO/NiCo2O4 composite 
using a solvothermal process with different ratios of solvents, the 
resulting NiCo/NiO/NiCo2O4 achieved a current density of 10 mA/cm2 
at small overpotential of 142 mV [12]. In spite of these attractive features in this direction, NiCo2O4 still suffer from limitations of poor 
electric conductivity and insufficient electroactive sites. 
Taking these respects into consideration, considerable research efforts have been devoted to overcome these obstacles. Constructing oxygen vacancies-rich NiCo2O4 on 3D conductive matrix is a viable 
avenue. Such intrinsic characteristics could act a Janus role in offering 
more electroactive sites and accelerating ions diffusion [13–14]. More 
significantly, 3D conductive matrix could offer large surface area and 
short ions/electrons channel [15–17]. 5.8 trillion cigarettes are smoked 
worldwide per annum, and cigarette ash is a major waste disposal and 
environmental pollution hazard. In an effort to turn dangerous waste 
into high value products, the cost-free cigarette ash can be considered as 
the carbonaceous materials with favorable electrochemical properties. 
Nicotine, a chemical that contains nitrogen, is a stimulant found in 
certain plants, most notably tobacco. It can be deemed as a special 
precursor to offer nitrogen in porous carbon derived from cigarette ash. 
Motivated by these aforementioned considerations, in this work, 
oxygen vacancies-rich NiCo2O4-4x nanowires assembled on discarded 
cigarette ash derived porous carbon (named as Ov-NCO/PC-Y) as electrocatalyst/electrode for optimizing hydrogen evolution reaction and 
electrochemical energy storage is achieved via hydrothermal treatment 
combined with partial reduction process. The induced rich oxygen vacancies can not only offer prominent conductivity and expose rich 
electroactive sites, but facilitate ions diffusion rate and boost efficient 
contact between electrolyte and active material. In addition, the introduction of phosphate ions is beneficial for weakening the activation 
energy of their redox reaction, and therefore dramatically enhancing 
their surface reactivity and electrochemical reaction reversibility. 
Moreover, the interconnected 3D porous network construction, high 
surface area and short ions/electrons channel can remarkably enhance 
the electrochemical properties. As a result, the Ov-NCO/PC-0.1 can 
efficiently catalyze HER with a small overpotential of 135.9 mV at 10 
mA/cm2 and deliver a beneficial kinetics. Furthermore, Ov-NCO/PC-0.1 
demonstrates decent specific capacitance (1002.2 F/g), and Ov-NCO/ 
PC-0.1//AC-based aqueous asymmetrical supercapacitor offers the energy density of 32.7 Wh/kg at 160.2 W/kg. This work could provide 
valuable insights for the fabrication of high-performance bifunctional 
transition metal oxide-based materials for electrochemical energy storage and conversion. "
177-intro.txt.txt,"The energy storage and conversation devices occupy an indispensable position in developing sustainable energy in view of the trend of the 
growing energy shortage and environmental pollution caused by the 
exhaustive exploitation of non-renewable energy [1–5]. Supercapacitors 
(SCs) seem to be an intuitive choice for rendering universal energy solutions in view of their desirable advantages, such as fast charge/discharge capability, high power output and long lifespan [6–8]. The 
electrode materials with high energy density and power density are the

electrodes as well as HER catalysts for the comparatively inexpensive, 
superior theoretical capacitance and outstanding electrochemical 
behavior [13–17]. Until now, comprehensive delightful results have 
been reported. For instance, Guan et al. fabricated the hollow NiCo2O4 
nanowall arrays on flexible carbon cloth through a facile two-step solution method, which delivered a high capacitance of 422 C/g [8]. Liu’s 
group reported a simple strategy to synthesize NiCo2O4 nanoneedles 
supported on carbon cloth as electrocatalyst for HER [18]. Xiong et al. 
studied and prepared a bifunctional Mo-doped Co3O4 ultrathin nanosheets, which showed a low overpotential of 79 mV at 10 mA/cm2 in 
HER processes and exhibited a high areal capacitance 2815 mF/cm2 at 1 
mA/cm2 [19]. Yang et al. fabricated Co3O4 nanowires@NiO ultrafine 
nanowires on Ni foam via coating the NiO ultrafine nanowires on porous 
Co3O4 nanowire arrays, which delivered excellent electrochemical 
performance [20]. 
Despite these desirable achievements, an intractable issue of 
NiCo2O4 and Co3O4 is poor charge transfer kinetics accompanied with 
short diffusion distance of electrolytes within electrode/catalyst [21]. 
NiCo2O4 and Co3O4 with decent theoretical capacity and favorable 
catalytic activity usually encounter fast deterioration of rate capability 
and cycle stability arising from unsatisfactory charge transfer kinetics, 
respectively. Besides, the underneath part could hardly participate in 
the electrochemical charge storage process [22,23]. To date, 
comprehensive strategies have been described to seek breakthroughs, 
and the rate capability and cycling lifespan of NiCo2O4 and Co3O4 are 
greatly improved by introducing carbon-based materials [24–27]. 
However, enhancing rate capability and cycle lifespan by these means is 
usually at the sacrifice of electrochemical activity in view of the limited 
activity sites. Given that both rate capability, cycling stability and 
electrochemical activity are crucial in determining the comprehensive 
energy storage and conversation properties. In this regard, an efficient 
tactic that can obtain favorable rate capability and long-term stability 
without the sacrifice of electrochemical activity from the electrodes’ 
porous and intrinsic properties is desired, yet remains challenging. 
Affording the unrivaled flexibility to tune size or morphology, silicon 
dioxide (SiO2) has proved versatile in electrochemical energy storage 
and conversation fields [28]. It is a common method with easy manipulation and high efficiency that SiO2 serviced as the sacrificial core is 
tightly wrapped by the shell of target product to prepare hollow/porous 
materials like metal hydroxides [28], metal oxides [29,30], and carbon 
materials [31,32] with desired properties. The sacrifice process of SiO2 
assures those hollow target products preserve the spherical-like structure from raw SiO2. It inspires us by the reverse thinking that: could it be 
possible to use SiO2 as sacrificial shell and the target products as core to 
prepare desired porous microspheres with large specific surface area?

oxygen vacancies modulated NiCo2O4 and Co3O4 microspheres with 
superior specific surface area (SA-NiCo2O4 (Ov) and SA-Co3O4 (Ov)) is 
proposed via encapsulated self-activation strategy (SiO2 as sacrificial 
shell) combined with partial reduction method. The SA-NiCo2O4 (Ov) 
and SA-Co3O4 (Ov) depict fascinating electrochemical performance 
owing to the following characteristics: (i) The large specific surface area 
could offer rich electroactive sites and large electrode/electrolyte 
interface, which is benefiting for fast ions diffusion and redox reaction. 
(ii) The rich oxygen vacancies within NiCo2O4 and Co3O4 could provide 
superior conductivity, fast ions diffusion rate, and rich active sites. Besides, the introduction of phosphate ions on the surface of metal oxides 
could significantly enhance the surface reactivity and electrochemical 
reaction reversibility by weakening the activation energy of redox reactions. The experimental results further confirm simultaneously 
enhanced rate capability, long-term durability and electrochemical activity. Notably, upon employing this route, a wide range of transition 
metal oxides could be attained, including but not limited to, Fe2O3, 
MnO2, and NiO, which are promising electrochemical materials for 
electrocatalysis and energy storage"

and energy recovery [11,12]. The other part of a self-powered system is 
energy storage device. As a type of novel and green energy storage 
component, asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) is characterized by high 
power/energy density, ultralong cycling lifetime, wide operation temperature range as well as excellent reliability, and it has great potential 
applications in electronics [13–15]. Furthermore, ASCs could be integrated into a self-powered system by combined with energy harvesting 
devices [16,17]. Although ASCs and MFCs have developed rapidly in 
recent years [18,19], there are few reports on the integration between 
ASCs and MFCs into a self-powered system. Additionally, in order to 
meet the requirements of ASCs (high energy density) and MFCs (high 
output power density), it is necessary to make a great breakthrough in 
the cathode materials [19,20]. 
Among all of the cathode materials for ASCs and MFCs (Table S1 and 
S2), MnO2 is considered to be the most promising due to the advantages 
of high theoretical capacitance, abundant resources and low price [21]. 
Nevertheless, the electrically conductive properties of MnO2 are not 
quite well (10− 5
~10− 6 S cm− 1
), and it leads to slow reaction kinetics, 
poor rate performance and rapid decay of electrochemical performance 
[22]. For that reason, it is still a great challenge to design and manufacture MnO2 based cathode with internal modification, which should 
be provided with outstanding rate performance and exceptional electrochemical good cycle stability. 
In this paper, the above ticklish problems can be solved by introducing native oxygen vacancies into MnO2 nanorods (NRs) with hydrogenation treatment. The oxygen vacancies in MnO2 NRs play the role 
of shallow donors, which could effectively boost the electronic conductivity, provide more active sites and speed up surface reactions [23]. 
Consequently, the oxygen vacancies modulated MnO2 NRs (OV–MnO2 
NRs) exhibits superior electrochemical performances as a positive material for flexible ASCs and MFCs. What is more, a novel self-powered 
system has been devised by integrating the flexible ASCs and MFCs, 
which can be self-charged up to 0.9 V and complete the energy conversion and storage at the same time. This work provides an idea for the 
research and development of self-powered integrated devices in the 
future."

corresponding active electrode materials are carbon nanotubes
(CNTs), reduced graphene oxide (rGO), and activated carbon (AC),
etc. [7]. In pseudocapacitors, charges are stored based on fast
and surface-controlled reversible Faradaic redox reactions with
varying potential windows. However, battery-type electrode materials store charges based on diffusion-controlled Faradaic redox reaction within a constant potential window. In hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs), both EDLCs and pseudocapacitor/batterytype electrode materials are used. For example, the consistency
of any carbon-based negative-electrode and a metal-oxide (e.g.
RuO2/Mn2O3, etc.) positive-electrode ensures to have high energy

RuO2, NiO, Mn2O3, NiCo2O4, Ni(OH)2, NiCo2S4, and polyaniline,

cause of its numerous advantages: rich electrochemical properties, low toxicity, superior chemical stability, high theoretical capacity, natural abundancy, and the Mn being capable of existing in various ionic states (Mn2+, Mn3+, Mn4+ & Mn6+). Further,
it can also be used with several alkaline and acid-based electrolytes [19–21]. Unfortunately, Mn2O3 has lower electrical conductivity, simple geometric structure, and large volume expansion at high rates of charging/discharging. This leads to reduced
charge storage capacity and unsatisfactory rate capability/longterm durability which hinders the possibility of practical, reallife energy storage devices based on Mn2O3. To avoid such a situation the research society has made common strategies to improve the electrochemical storage characteristic of cathode materials by adding highly conductive additive materials such as rGO,
CNTs, and AC, etc. An alternate and reasonable strategy is defect engineering at the sub-micro/nanometre scale, such as rational metal-doping to enhance the intrinsic electrical conductivity
which leads to increased Faradaic redox-reaction in electrode material [22–24]. In particular, the aliovalent dopant (Nd3+, La3+, and
Sm3+) crucially generate higher oxygen vacancies than isovalent
dopants (Ti4+, Zr4+, and Sn4+) in pristine host metal oxide materials [25]. Typically, most researchers synthesized electrode materials in nanometre-scale range to achieve high specific capacitances due to the large surface-to-volume ratio of the materials.
However, at high rates/during cycle life, the nano-architecture may
cause some issues. For example, the particle fractures at a high rate
and deformation of morphology during long cyclic life [26–28].
On the other hand, the combination of self-assembled micro/nanostructure will critically boost the storage capacity as well as cycle stability of electrode material. Because the robust microstructure can significantly avoid volume expansion during the cycling
test, and nano-gap between the nano subunits can easily promote
a rapid faradaic redox reaction at the electrode/electrolyte interface [29]. Benefiting from these unique characteristic properties,
before, several approaches have been followed for the synthesis
of different morphologies and composites to enhance the storage
performance of electrode materials for HSCs. For example, Li et
al. [30] have reported on highly dense Mn2O3 nano-walls which
exhibited a high specific capacitance of 461 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1
along with remarkable cyclic stability of 82% after 5000 cycles
in 6M KOH electrolyte. In another report by Kolathodiet al. [31],
the surfactant-free Mn2O3 nanofibers made by electrospinning has
shown a high specific capacitance of 378 F g−1 at current density
of 1 A g−1 in 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte and good capacitance retention of 82.6% after 3000 cycles. Li et al. [32] have reported on
porous Mn2O3 nanocubes based electrode which exhibited a maximum specific capacitance of 191.1 F g−1 with a good rate capability
of 58.6%. Similarly, Liang et al. [33] reported the facile fabrication
of coaxial-cables like Mn2O3 nanofiber electrode, which offered a
specific capacitance of 216 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 with capacitance retention of 93% after 1000 charge-discharge cycles. So far, the effect
of rational metal-doping in Mn2O3 3D-MSs for the fabrication of
high energy density as well as long cycle stability pouch-type HSC
has not yet been known.
In this present study, we report a facile strategy to synthesize
pristine and Nd-doped α-Mn2O3 3D-microspheres (MSs) by simple
hydrothermal method and followed a post-calcination process in
atmospheric air. The synthesized samples were intensively characterized using various analytical tools. The Nd-doped α-Mn2O3 3DMSs have had uniform morphologies with notable porosity, oxygen vacancies, and robust micro-nano architecture. Our studies revealed that the Nd5%-doped Mn2O3 3D-MSs electrode exhibited a
high specific capacitance of 862.14 F g−1 (431.07 C g−1) at a current
density of 0.5 A g−1 with excellent cycling retention of 97.30% after
2000 cyclic test in 1M KOH. Further, pouch-type HSC devices were
made using porous Nd5%-Mn2O3 3D-MSs as a positive electrode
(cathode) and AC as a negative electrode (anode) with WhatmanTM
filter paper soaked in 1M KOH aqueous electrolyte as a separator. The assembled HSC devices delivered excellent electrochemical properties with a high energy density of 32.26 Wh kg−1 at a
power density of 800 W kg−1 with only 4.56% loss after 10,000
charge-discharge cycles."
180-intro.txt.txt,"With the increased attention being paid to energy and environmental issues, sustainable and renewable electrochemical energy storage (EES) devices have undergone considerable development over the
past few years [1–3]. As a typical EES technology, electrochemical supercapacitors (SCs) have attracted tremendous interest due to their high
power densities, superior rate capabilities, long cycling lives and excellent reliabilities [4–6]. As it is well known, SCs can be classified into
electrical double layer capacitors (EDLCs) and Faradaic pseudocapacitors based on their charge storage mechanism [7]. Due to the limitation
of surface ion adsorption/desorption, EDLCs always display a low energy density which restricts their practical application [8,9]. Compared
with EDLCs, pseudocapacitors that have surface and near-surface redox
reaction-dependencies have received considerable interest because of
their significantly improved specific capacitances [10,11].
To date, electrode materials with intrinsic pseudocapacitive performances mainly contain several metal oxides, conducting polymers
and so on [12–14]. Among these materials, MnO2 has been extensively
investigated because of its high theoretical capacity (about 1370 F
g−1), natural abundance, and environmental compatibility [15,16].
Additionally, MnO2 achieves a broader potential window than other
transition metal oxides in neutral aqueous electrolytes, thus leading to a
higher energy density. However, its relatively poor ionic (10−13 S
cm−1) and electronic conductivity (10−5–10−6 S cm−1) significantly
limit its electrochemical performance and actual capacity delivery of
MnO2 [17]. In order to accelerate electronic/ionic transport, a feasible
approach is to load MnO2 on a conductive framework such as graphene,
carbon nanotubes (CNTs), conductive polymers and activated carbons
(ACs). Attributed to the synergistic effect of the Faradaic reaction of
MnO2 and the conductivity of the considered framework, numerous
MnO2-based carbon composites have recently been developed that exhibit outstanding electrochemical performances with high specific capacitances and power densities. Some examples include laser-scribed
graphene-MnO2 [18], graphene-MnO2 [19], MnO2@CNTs/CNTs [20],

graphene or CNTs, which can serve as a 3D electron transfer network,
can generate a large number of available active sites to adsorb/desorb
electrolyte ions, thereby facilitating electrolyte ion transportation and
yielding enhanced reaction kinetics. Unfortunately, the high cost of
graphene and CNTs severely limits their commercial applications [12].
Due to their low costs, natural abundances and environmental
friendliness, biomass precursors have been used to prepare ACs with
hierarchical porous structures and high surface areas, which have been
widely used in industry. Inspiringly, it has been revealed that ACs can
improve the electrochemical properties of MnO2 [16,22,23]. Hybrids of
MnO2 and ACs display the combined advantages of pseudocapacitance
and double-layer capacitance, which can achieve a high specific capacitance due to synergistic effects. Moreover, the high surface area and
the conductive substrate of ACs endow them with the ability to accelerate charge transfer. However, the bulk microstructure of ACs has
relatively short-range orders, especially inefficient micro/macropores,
which may lead to a certain extent of degradation of the rate performance. On the other hand, it has been found that the bulk pseudocapacitive reaction of MnO2 only occurs on a thin sub-surface within a
few tens of nanometers [24]. Therefore, more studies are needed to
develop high-performance and low-cost carbon materials from green/
sustainable precursors. Moreover, the synergetic conversion of carbon
materials and MnO2 is also very meaningful, which can give full play to
the high capacitance of MnO2 and meet the requirements of high energy
and power density [12].
The present work prepares a hybrid of porous carbon and manganese oxides for supercapacitors application. A biomass of lotus seedpods
(LS) is used as the precursor to fabricate the lotus seedpod-derived
carbon framework (LSCF). Afterwards, nanostructured manganese
oxides (MnOx) are anchored on the LSCF in situ by a one-step hydrothermal-based redox synthesis process, where potassium permanganate
acts as the manganese source and oxidant, while LSCF acts as the reductant and substrate. Attributed to the synergistic effect of the nanostructured MnOx and the conductive LSCF, the optimized hybrid of
MnOx@LSCF exhibits enhanced electrochemical properties with a high
specific capacitance (406 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1) and a remarkable discharging rate capability (270 F g−1 at 10 A g−1). In particular, oxygen
vacancies have been induced into the crystal lattice of MnOx, which
facilitate cation redox reactions, surface charge storage as well as enhancing its electronic and ionic properties. An asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) constructed from MnOx@LSCF as the cathode and LSCF
as the anode delivers a high energy density of 48.1 Wh kg−1 at
500 W kg−1 (which can produce 22.2 Wh kg−1 at 10 kW kg−1), and a
superior capacitance retention of 90.1% after 5000 cycles, demonstrating the prospect of MnOx@LSCF for practical application in highperformance ASCs"

on electrode materials and the charge storage mechanisms, supercapacitors are categorized into two categories. The first one is
electrochemical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) in which carbon
or other similar materials are used as blocking electrodes. The
second one is pseudocapacitors or redox supercapacitors in which
transition metal oxide (e.g., RuO2, MoO2, etc.) or conducting polymers are used as electrodes [2–4]. In EDLCs, electrostatic charges
accumulate and diffuse at the electrode and electrolyte interface.
Because of high surface area, extraordinary chemical stability, and
electrical conductivity, carbon-based active materials use as electrodes in EDLS. EDLCs shows relatively small specific capacitance
to a range of (less than 250 F g−1) due to limited charge accumulation in the electrical double layer [5]. In pseudocapacitors,
transition metal oxides and electrically conducting polymers are
used as electrode materials. Fast and reversible surface or nearsurface reactions in metal oxides and conducting polymers play

a prominent role in pseudocapacitors charge storage [6]. Pseudocapacitors have higher specific capacitance compared to EDLCs.
However, transition metal oxides did not receive much attention
as pseudocapacitors electrodes due to low electrical conductivity,
less surface area, low abundance, and a high cost for their raw
materials.
Due to high specific energy density, nontoxicity, low cost, ecofriendliness, and availability, titanate appraised as a favorable material for supercapacitors [7–10]. Hydrogen titanate (HT) is usually
an n-type semiconductor. The charge density on the surface of HT
is higher than in other regions due to the attraction of the positively charged depletion region [11]. In a supercapacitor, it can
be used as an inexpensive electrode material. Furthermore, vertically oriented one-dimensional hydrogen titanate nanotube (HTNT)
arrays on titanium (Ti) offer a direct path for electron transport
along the long axis of nanotubes to the Ti foil substrate. Thus such
HTNT can be directly used as a supercapacitor electrode. Unmodified HTNT is a wide bandgap semiconductor (3.2 eV) [12]. Due to
the low conductivity of charges, HTNT suffers from an inferior capacitive. Therefore, the conductivity of HTNT is needed to improve
for the supercapacitor application. The electrical conductivity of
metal oxide can be improved by incorporating vacancies [13] and
impurities [14] into the material. Vacancy and impurity generate
donor or acceptor states in the bandgap and increase the conductivity. Nakamura et al. prepared TiO2 powders by radio-frequency
discharge plasma [15]. The photocatalytic activity of the plasmatreated TiO2 powders improves due to oxygen vacancy between
the valence and the conduction bands in the TiO2 band structure.
Lu et al. have shown that hydrogenation can improve the supercapacitance performance of TiO2 significantly [16]. They found that
TiO2 nanotube arrays hydrogenated at 400 °C achieved the highest
specific capacitances of 3.24 mFcm−2 at a scan rate of 100 mVs−1.
The capacitive performance-enhanced due to the improved donor
(oxygen vacancy) density and the increase in density of surface hydroxyl groups of TiO2 nanotube arrays.
However, the doping mentioned above or treatment methods required either expensive facilities [15], or high processing
temperatures, or a long duration process [16]. A fast and straightforward approach to modifying titanate for improved surface area
and electrochemical properties is highly necessary for practical
applications. In the current work, we have studied the pseudocapacitance performance of low energy (5 keV) Ar+ ion irradiate
HT nanotube. HT nanotubes were irradiated at different fluences.
At low fluence, nanotubes are welded together and create a fine
porous structure, surface area increases. However, at higher fluence, the junction gets thicken and cluster together, choke the gap
in between nanotubes, and active surface area decreases. During
irradiation, oxygen vacancy introduction in HT structure leads to
additional Ti d states in the bandgap region. More presence of
empty Ti d orbital near Fermi level enhance the charge-transfer
property and capacitance in case of irradiated HT nanotubes. Due
to higher surface area and charge-transfer property, capacitance
increases drastically in irradiated HT nanotube at lower fluence.
However, at higher fluence, due to low surface area capacitance
decrease. Thus, this work exhibits the possibility of using the
ion beam irradiation technique to enhance the surface area,
charge-transfer property and capacitance of the supercapacitor
electrode. Surface morphology, crystal, and chemical structure have
been analyzed using field emission scanning electron microscope
(FESEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman scattering, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Brunauer−Emmett−Teller (BET)
techniques. The supercapacitance property of unmodified and
irradiate hydrogen titanate nanotubes have been evaluated using
three-electrode cyclic voltameter and electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy"
182-intro.txt.txt,"As an important means of electrochemical energy storage,
supercapacitors show many advantages such as high power density, fast charging rate and long cycle lifetime [1]. However, their
applications are usually restricted by relatively low energy density
(E) [2], which depends on capacitance (C) and operation voltage
window (V) based on the equation E = 0.5CV2
. Carbon materials,
metal oxides and conductive polymers have been extensively studied as electrode materials for supercapacitors [3,4]. Among them,
transition metal oxides have gained significant interests due to
their higher energy density than carbon materials and better
cycling stability than conductive polymers. Recently, La-based perovskite oxides have been reported as a promising supercapacitor
electrode based on the anion-intercalation mechanism [5]. For perovskite oxides, the oxygen-vacancy can be tailored by partial substitution of cations on A-site and/or B-site, allowing an effective
control over the conductivity and electrochemical properties. It is
found that La-based perovskite oxides show an improved conductivity, an extremely wide voltage window and excellent cycling
stability [6–10].
The novel anion-intercalation mechanism of perovskite oxides
was first reported in LaMnO3, and researches have shown that
LaMnO3d possesses a good electrochemical behavior and cycling
stability. Nevertheless, further promotion is restricted by some
intrinsic disadvantages such as low conductivity. While the analogue LaNiO3 exhibits a relatively smaller resistivity than LaMnO3
[6,11]. Considering the similar ionic radius of Mn (0.58 Å) and Ni
(0.56 Å) [12], partial substitution of Ni for Mn in LaMnO3 should
be feasible to improve the conductivity and the electrochemical
properties accordingly. Moreover, alkaline earth (such as Sr) substitution on A-site has been proved to have a great influence on
the charge storage performance by tailoring the oxygen vacancy
concentration. Therefore, optimized electrochemical performance
can be expected for the co-substituted LaMnO3 component on both
A-site (Sr) and B-site (Ni). It should be an attractive issue to determine the resulting structural evolution and electrochemical properties with the variation of substitution amount.
Herein, La1-xSrxMn0.9Ni0.1O3 nanofibers (LSMN-x) (x = 0, 0.15,
0.45) are prepared by electrospun method. The effect of Sr substitution on the structure of LaMn0.9Ni0.1O3 perovskite nanofibers has
been investigated, and the electrochemical performance has been
tailored correspondingly."

186-intro.txt.txt,"In recent decades, the growing demand for high-performance mobile 
devices and renewable energy has promoted ongoing development of 
electrochemical energy storage devices [1–6]. Supercapacitors (SCs), as 
a class of energy storage technologies, have attracted much interest 
owing to their remarkable characteristics (e.g. long life span, fast 
charge/discharge rate, and high power density) [7,8]. With respect to 
their charge storage mechanisms, SCs are mainly classified as either 
electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) or pseudocapacitors [9], with 
pseudocapacitors further divided into surface-redox-dominated and 
intercalation-type-dominated [1,3]. Benefitting from the utilisation of 
an inner crystal, intercalation-dominated materials generally exhibit a 
higher specific capacitance than redox-dominated materials. However, 
in terms of the nature of ion diffusion, the relatively deep insertion of 
ions causes a relatively long reaction time and inferior rate capability, 
even though some synergistic methods, such as nanosizing, increasing 
electrical conductivity, introducing mesoporosity, et al., have been 
proposed to improve the rate performance [10–13]. When the mass 
loading is increased to 10 mg cm− 2 (commercial device level), the rate 
performance of intercalation-dominated electrodes is further degraded 
[13–15]. How to further enhance the intrinsic charge-storage capability 
of pseudocapacitive electrode materials under high mass loading remains a major challenge for SCs. It can be assumed that if the ratio 
between the redox pseudocapacitance and intercalation pseudocapacitance of a specific material can be effectively adjusted, a trade-off between the two pseudocapacitive mechanisms could be achieved along 
with an enhanced specific capacitance, without sacrificing the rate 
performance. Considering the limited ability to regulate the proportion 
of a given pseudocapacitive mechanism for a specific material, to the 
best of our knowledge, there have been no attempts to obtain such a 
trade-off between the different pseudocapacitive mechanisms. 
Among pseudocapacitive materials, tungsten oxide (WO3) is a 
promising electrode material for SCs that has attracted much attention

due to its outstanding electrochemical stability, high inherent density 
(7.16 g cm− 3
), and abundant crystal structures and oxidation states 
[16–18]. The pseudocapacitive characteristics of tungsten oxide are 
closely related to its crystal structure. Hexagonal tungsten oxide (hWO3) has a large and smooth six-member-ring crystal tunnel typically 
suitable for proton intercalation, whereas orthorhombic WO3⋅0.33H2O 
(ort-WO3⋅0.33H2O) has a zigzag six-member-ring lattice configuration 
that makes direct proton insertion difficult [16,19–22]. The different 
crystal configurations of h-WO3 and ort-WO3⋅0.33H2O mean that the 
former exhibits high proton-intercalation pseudocapacitance but inferior rate performance, and the latter has a surface-redox characteristic 
with relatively low capacitance [16,19–21]. The heterophase structures 
of these two tungsten oxides and their large six-membered-ring lattice 
spaces can be expected to lead to a novel proton transport process. 
However, to our knowledge, there have been no reports about the 
controllable construction of heterophase structures of these tungsten 
oxides, because both the hexagonal and hydrated phases of WO3 are 
metastable. 
It is generally accepted that introducing oxygen vacancies (Vos) into 
electrode materials can enhance their carrier density, and thereby 
improve the electrical conductivity and reaction kinetics of the metal 
oxides [23–25]. Pioneer work reported by some researchers revealed the 
role of Vos in improving electrochemical performance. Dunn’s group 
used microwave-activated hydrothermal synthesis to introduce Vos into 
MoO3, which significantly improved its Li+-ion-intercalation kinetics 
and achieved excellent structural stability [26]. Cao et al. initiated the 
laser irradiation method to prepare a Vos-abundant ultrafine Co3O4 
nanoparticles/graphene composite that exhibited ultrahigh rate performance, and Vos were proved to facilitate the electrochemical charge 
transfer [27]. Similar to the one-pot synthesis method mentioned above, 
the in-situ construction of heterostructures or heterophase structures is 
also considered to be helpful for tuning the electronic structure and 
producing abundant oxygen vacancy defects [28–30], which were 
recently reported to facilitate proton shuttles [31]. Despite the reports of 
many studies regarding the introduction of Vos, the effect of Vos on ion 
transport in the heterophase structure of specific materials remains 
uncertain. In addition, hierarchical 1D tubular structures composed of 
nanoscale subunits have been considered to provide mass-transport 
paths that boost rate capability owing to their short diffusion paths 
and high surface areas [29,32]. Inspired by these findings, we believed 
that the in-situ formation of a Vos-abundant h-WO3/ort-WO3⋅0.33H2O 
heterophase structure with hierarchical 1D tubular architecture could be 
expected to produce proton-shuttle tunnels and improved capacitive 
performance under high mass loading. What is also interesting is the 
failure mechanism of this heterophase structure, because the long-term 
stability is the main problem to be overcome for pseudocapacitive materials and will directly affect their practical applications. As far as we 
know, there are few systematic experimental studies on the failure 
mechanism of capacitive performance of WO3-based heterophase 
structure. 
In this study, we used proton-induced phase transformation to 
construct a Vo-abundant h-WO3/ort-WO3⋅0.33H2O heterophase structure (HOHS) with a split-level nanotubes-on-nanoplates morphology. By 
combining phase engineering with oxygen defects, the proportion of the 
intercalation-pseudocapacitance contribution to the total capacitive 
charge storage becomes adjustable over a wide range from 25.8% to 
85.3% total capacitance. In addition, the hollow pores of individual 
nanotubes and the space between split-level nanotube clusters facilitate 
the transport of electrolyte ions in high-mass-loading WO3. An optimised electrode with an appropriate proportion of intercalation pseudocapacitance at a mass loading of 10.8 mg cm− 2 exhibits an excellent 
areal capacitance of 2552 mF cm− 2 at a current density of 1 mA cm− 2
. 
Furthermore, the capacitance retention of the electrode is as high as 78% 
at 20 mA cm− 2
, which represents the highest value reported to date for 
pure WO3-based electrode materials. This HOHS also demonstrates 
robust cyclic stability (with almost no decay in the areal capacitance 
after 5000 cycles). An asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) delivers a high 
areal capacitance of 427.9 mF cm− 2 and a maximum energy density of 
116.5 μWh cm− 2 at a power density of 700 μW cm− 2

187-intro.txt.txt,"Regarding the apace increasing issues over aggravation of environment pollution and serious consumption of fossil fuels, there is
currently an urgent need to develop sustainable energy storage
and conversion devices [1,2]. With extraordinary merits such as
rapid charge and discharge rate, high power densities, long cycling
life and environmental friendliness, supercapacitors (SCs) are
attracting utmost attention in energy storage field [3]. Nevertheless, the lower energy density has been a leading limitation needed
figure out for supercapacitors. [4]. Likewise, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has drawn considerable attention as an important semireaction in multifarious energy storage and conversion systems
such as electrochemical water splitting [5]. Whereas, it is crucial
to exploit highly active electrocatalysts due to the sluggish kinetics
of OER [6]. Therefore, in order to meet higher practical application
requirements, it is imperative to develop efficient and affordable
bifunctional supercapacitor and electrocatalytic materials.
Among numerous transition-metal oxides (TMOs) with potential excellent electrochemical and catalytic properties, Co3O4 has
attracted tons of attention due to high theoretical capacitance, rich
redox chemistry and low price, implying great potential for energy
storage and conversion [7]. In general, the electrochemical properties of electroactive materials are definitively depended on the surface or near-surface chemistry, among which the large active
surface can expose adequate electroactive sites for rapid and efficient redox reactions [8,9]. Obviously, owing to the fact that only
part of the active substances can participate in the electrochemical
charge storage process and electrocatalysis, the electrochemical
performance and electrocatalytic activity of pure bulk TMOs are
much lower than expected [10].
There are two efficient strategies being followed to enhance the
electrochemical performance and electrocatalytic activity of TMOs.
The first one is to modulate the structure of nanocomposites, especially the hollow structure. At present, the strategies for preparing
hollow structures include thermal annealing [11], chemical vapor
deposition [12],HNO3 etching [13] and so on. The second effective
strategy is to introduce defects, such as oxygen vacancies. The oxygen vacancies can not only change the electronic structure of the
material without sacrificing its structural stability, but also promote ion/electron transport and accelerate Faraday redox reaction
[14,15]. The methods are widely used to introduce oxygen vacancies include H2-assisted thermal annealing [16],NaBH4-assisted
cyanogel hydrolysis [17],plasma treatment [18],etc. In conclusion,
introducing a large number of oxygen vacancies into the hollow
structure can not only expose more active sites and significantly
increase the electronic conductivity, but also effectively alleviate
the volume expansion during charge and discharge [19]. Unfortunately, the above treating processes usually involve strong acid
or reducing chemicals, high pressure, or unique equipment. Therefore, a facile and green strategy to prepare hollow nanomaterials
with rich oxygen vacancies is urgently needed but still a tough
challenge.
Plant polyphenol tannic acid (TA) extracted from leaves and
roots of many plants are gaining burgeoning attention in material
surface modification because of their specific physical and chemical properties [20]. The rich pyrogallol group in TA can readily
coordinate with transition metal ions to form a metal-polyphenol
networks (MPNs) [21]. Therefore, it is feasible to use TA to etch
MOF to form hollow structures [22]. Meanwhile, polyphenolic
acids can be used as oxygen sources to produce oxygen vacancies
at low temperatures. The annealing treatment process may cause
the OAH bond in the polyphenolic acids molecule rupture and surface oxygen vacancies are formed [23]. For instance, owing to TA
contain a lot of oxygen atoms, TA-Co/Fe films has been reported
to form oxygen vacancies during the annealing process for electrochemical water splitting [24]. Hence, we speculated that TA etching MOF has the opportunity to construct nano-hollow electrode
materials with abundant oxygen vacancies, and is expected to alleviate the above-mentioned problems of traditional catalysts and
electrode materials in SCs system.
Herein, we propose a green and facile method to prepare porous
Co3O4@Co/NC hollow nanoparticles (Co3O4@Co/NC-HN) with rich
oxygen vacancy defects via a TA etching on ZIF-67 followed by calcination processes. Compared with conventional materials, Co3-
O4@Co/NC-HN inherits the large specific surface area of ZIF-67
and also has a hollow structure, which facilitates the storage and
diffusion of electrolyte ions. Moreover, the introduction of oxygen
vacancies promotes faster charge storage kinetics and enable the
Co3O4@Co/NC-HN structure to be retained during the charge/discharge process. The results of this paper raise the possibility for
designing advanced and low-cost bifunctional electrode materials
for supercapacitor and electrocatalyst"
188-intro.txt.txt,"rgy crises, global sustainable development requires researchers to 
develop science and technology related to green and sustainable energy 
storage equipment [1–4]. Supercapacitor as a high-performance electrochemical energy storage device has attracted worldwide attention 
[5–9]. How to improve the performance of supercapacitor is a big 
challenge that worldwide researchers need to overcome until now. 
Design and preparation of novel electrodes is the most effective and 
direct method [10,11]. 
Transition metal oxides have been widely studied because the 
Faradaic reaction can not only provide much higher specific energy than 
traditional carbon materials, but also have better electrochemical stability than polymer materials [12,13]. ZnO has excellent electrical 
properties. Lee et al. reported the specific capacitance of ZnO/graphene 
oxide composites increased by 83% compared with graphene oxide 
electrode [14]. TiO2 is an environmentally friendly semiconductor. Guo 
et al. reported the as-assembled HMPC/iTiO2-NWAs asymmetric 
supercapacitor exhibits ultrahigh cell voltage (2.3 V) and high volumtric 
energy (6.27 mW h cm–3
) [15]. Yadav et al. reported Co3O4//La2O3 
asymmetric supercapacitor shows good performance with superior 
specific capacitance [16]. 
Compared with these transition metal oxides such as ZnO, TiO2 and 
Co3O4, Fe2O3 has more advantages in natural abundance, cost, environmental friendliness and specific capacity [17,18]. Based on the 
reasonable structural design approaches, the performance of Fe2O3 can 
be further improved by compounding it with other materials [19–23]. 
Sn2O3 as a new type of supercapacitor electrode material is a good 
choice because of its thermodynamic stability and excellent electrical 
properties [24,25]. The rich valence of iron and tin elements is favorable 
for Faraday reaction. In addition, a series of studies have shown that the 
introduction of abundant oxygen vacancies into transition metal oxides 
can change the electronic structure, reduce the distance between electrons to the large conduction band, improve the electrical conductivity 
of the materials, resulting in the development of electrochemical

the hybrid supercapacitor, especially the energy density and cycle stability, can be promoted by compounding Fe2O3 and Sn2O3 and the 
introduction of oxygen vacancies. 
In this work, we successfully fabricated an oxygen-deficient 
Fe2O3@Sn2O3 nanocomposite composed of Fe2O3 and Sn2O3 
nanosheet-arrays on Ni foam and carried out a series of characterizations such as XRD, XPS, EPR, SEM, and TEM to study the structures and 
morphologies of the composites. The electrochemical performance tests 
in three-electrode system showed that the oxygen-deficient 
Fe2O3@Sn2O3 nanocomposite possesses an excellent specific capacity

, and still maintained 
477.6 C g− 1 at 10 mA cm− 2
. It also has superior rate capability and long 
cycle stability (83.3% capacitance retention after 4500 cycles). 
Furthermore, the hybrid supercapacitor was fabricated successfully, 
which showed a high energy density of 39.1 W h kg− 1 at 1.28 kW kg− 1

on electrode materials and the charge storage mechanisms, supercapacitors are categorized into two categories. The first one is
electrochemical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) in which carbon
or other similar materials are used as blocking electrodes. The
second one is pseudocapacitors or redox supercapacitors in which
transition metal oxide (e.g., RuO2, MoO2, etc.) or conducting polymers are used as electrodes [2–4]. In EDLCs, electrostatic charges
accumulate and diffuse at the electrode and electrolyte interface.
Because of high surface area, extraordinary chemical stability, and
electrical conductivity, carbon-based active materials use as electrodes in EDLS. EDLCs shows relatively small specific capacitance
to a range of (less than 250 F g−1) due to limited charge accumulation in the electrical double layer [5]. In pseudocapacitors,
transition metal oxides and electrically conducting polymers are
used as electrode materials. Fast and reversible surface or nearsurface reactions in metal oxides and conducting polymers play

a prominent role in pseudocapacitors charge storage [6]. Pseudocapacitors have higher specific capacitance compared to EDLCs.
However, transition metal oxides did not receive much attention
as pseudocapacitors electrodes due to low electrical conductivity,
less surface area, low abundance, and a high cost for their raw
materials.
Due to high specific energy density, nontoxicity, low cost, ecofriendliness, and availability, titanate appraised as a favorable material for supercapacitors [7–10]. Hydrogen titanate (HT) is usually
an n-type semiconductor. The charge density on the surface of HT
is higher than in other regions due to the attraction of the positively charged depletion region [11]. In a supercapacitor, it can
be used as an inexpensive electrode material. Furthermore, vertically oriented one-dimensional hydrogen titanate nanotube (HTNT)
arrays on titanium (Ti) offer a direct path for electron transport
along the long axis of nanotubes to the Ti foil substrate. Thus such
HTNT can be directly used as a supercapacitor electrode. Unmodified HTNT is a wide bandgap semiconductor (3.2 eV) [12]. Due to
the low conductivity of charges, HTNT suffers from an inferior capacitive. Therefore, the conductivity of HTNT is needed to improve
for the supercapacitor application. The electrical conductivity of
metal oxide can be improved by incorporating vacancies [13] and
impurities [14] into the material. Vacancy and impurity generate
donor or acceptor states in the bandgap and increase the conductivity. Nakamura et al. prepared TiO2 powders by radio-frequency
discharge plasma [15]. The photocatalytic activity of the plasmatreated TiO2 powders improves due to oxygen vacancy between
the valence and the conduction bands in the TiO2 band structure.
Lu et al. have shown that hydrogenation can improve the supercapacitance performance of TiO2 significantly [16]. They found that
TiO2 nanotube arrays hydrogenated at 400 °C achieved the highest
specific capacitances of 3.24 mFcm−2 at a scan rate of 100 mVs−1.
The capacitive performance-enhanced due to the improved donor
(oxygen vacancy) density and the increase in density of surface hydroxyl groups of TiO2 nanotube arrays.
However, the doping mentioned above or treatment methods required either expensive facilities [15], or high processing
temperatures, or a long duration process [16]. A fast and straightforward approach to modifying titanate for improved surface area
and electrochemical properties is highly necessary for practical
applications. In the current work, we have studied the pseudocapacitance performance of low energy (5 keV) Ar+ ion irradiate
HT nanotube. HT nanotubes were irradiated at different fluences.
At low fluence, nanotubes are welded together and create a fine
porous structure, surface area increases. However, at higher fluence, the junction gets thicken and cluster together, choke the gap
in between nanotubes, and active surface area decreases. During
irradiation, oxygen vacancy introduction in HT structure leads to
additional Ti d states in the bandgap region. More presence of
empty Ti d orbital near Fermi level enhance the charge-transfer
property and capacitance in case of irradiated HT nanotubes. Due
to higher surface area and charge-transfer property, capacitance
increases drastically in irradiated HT nanotube at lower fluence.
However, at higher fluence, due to low surface area capacitance
decrease. Thus, this work exhibits the possibility of using the
ion beam irradiation technique to enhance the surface area,
charge-transfer property and capacitance of the supercapacitor
electrode. Surface morphology, crystal, and chemical structure have
been analyzed using field emission scanning electron microscope
(FESEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman scattering, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Brunauer−Emmett−Teller (BET)

193-intro.txt.txt,"As the popularity and necessity of sustainable, renewable energy
sources such as wind and solar continues to grow so too does
the demand for new, efficient means of storing energy from
these intermittent sources. While lithium ion batteries and fuel
cells have proven to be effective means of storing electricity,
they require extended charging and discharging time periods
and fail to handle the rapid charging and discharging rate
requirements mandated by the nature of these energy sources.
On the other end of the spectrum, traditional electrostatic
capacitors can deliver high power but at a signicant cost to
their energy densities. Electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs)
that utilize high surface area carbons, known as supercapacitors, as well as metal-oxide based materials, known as
pseudocapacitors, have shown great promise as an intermediary to bridge this gap in both energy and power densities.1
In a parallel plate capacitor charge is stored non-faradaically
as electrostatic charge via electric double layer formation.

utilize high surface area materials such as carbons with surface
areas >1000 m2 g1 as electrodes and rely on the concept of
electric double layer capacitance to achieve over 300 F g1
,
however, these power densities come at a cost to the total energy
density of the device.2
Pseudocapacitors bridge the gap between batteries and
EDLCs in that in addition to any double layer capacitance, they
store charge by utilizing faradaic process involving surface or
near surface redox reactions that give rise to capacitive electrochemical features.3 In addition to the classic rectangular
capacitance envelope seen for EDLCs during cyclic voltammetry
(CV) experiments, pseudocapacitors also display peaks that are
indicative of redox processes within the electrode material,
which means that the voltage–current response is not the same

strategy to improve cell performance has been to utilize
different materials at the two electrodes, such as TiO2/MnO2,
supported on high surface are carbons to expand the voltage
window.7
There are four generally proposed operational mechanisms
of pseudocapacitance. The rst is surface redox reactions that
occur in materials such as metal oxides and hydroxides. For
example, Ni(OH)2 can be reversibly oxidized to NiOOH via
deprotonation in basic electrolyte to store charge.8,9 The second
mechanism of pseudocapacitive charge storage utilizes underpotential deposition and electrosorption such as in the case of
proton underpotential deposition on Pt:10,11 the third and fourth
mechanisms utilize rapid intercalation and deintercalation of
ions into and out of the bulk material. For example, MoO3 can
be reversibly reduced and oxidized to intercalate and to deintercalate cations such as H+ and Li+
.
12,13 As recently shown by
Mefford et al. and Alexander et al., pseudocapacitive charge
storage using anions (OH) can be achieved with perovskites:14,15 our group has shown that the anion intercalation
mechanism is affected by the oxygen vacancy content (d) and
can be described in a perovskite for a given transition metal B
as:
A[B2d
z+;B(12d)
(z+1)+]O3d + 2dOH 4
AB2d
(z+1)+O3 + 2de
 + dH2O (2)
To put it simply, more oxygen vacancies present in the lattice
means there are more empty sites for OH ions to ll and thus
increase the amount of stored charge. It is this last type of
mechanism of reversible anion based pseudocapacitive charge
storage that we investigate herein.
Perovskite oxides have the formula ABO3 where the A-site is
typically made up of an alkaline earth or rare earth metal while
the B-site is made up of one or more transition metals. Additionally, there are multiple derivatives of this structure
including Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) oxides that have a crystal
structure represented as An+1BnO3n+1 or equivalently
(AO)(ABO3+d)n, wherein n(BO6) octahedra perovskite layers are
separated by rocksalt (AO)(OA) double layers. Previous work by
our group demonstrated how the perovskite LaMnO3d utilized
a newly described hydroxide intercalation mechanism to achieve impressive pseudocapacitive performance and how reduction of the bulk structure introduced oxygen vacancies that
greatly improved the amount of charge that could be stored.14
An additional study of La1xSrxMO3d (M ¼ Mn, Fe, Co)
perovskites demonstrated how increased oxygen vacancies
upon substitution of La for Sr resulted in exceptional pseudocapacitive performance.15 Furthermore, we have demonstrated
how increased M–O bond covalency in the perovskite La1xSrxCoO3d and in Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) oxides with the
formula La2xSrxNi1yFeyO4+d, a derivative of the perovskite
structure, allowed for increased rates of oxygen diffusion.
Oxygen diffusion through vacancies within the perovskite
lattice or through the rock salt layer of the RP structure aided in
the exceptional performance of these oxides towards the oxygen
evolution reaction (OER)16 as well as the electrooxidations of
urea and small alcohols.8,17 Elsewhere, others have demonstrated how perovskite materials can be used as anion-based
pseudocapacitors with Ba1xSrxCo1yFeyO3d, LaNiO3, SrCo0.9-
Nb0.1O3d, and La1xCaxMnO3 proving to be some of the most
effective compositions.18–22
Herein, we report the synthesis and electrochemical evaluation of CaMnO3d perovskite and Ca2MnO4d Ruddlesden–
Popper materials as pseudocapacitor materials to leverage
previously discovered trends in catalytic and capacitive activity
to further the understanding of how complex metal oxides can
be tuned to increase their ability to store charge via anion
intercalation. The specic choice of Ca as the A-site element and
Mn in the B-site was made based upon the ability to synthesize
both perovskite and Ruddlesden–Popper versions of the same
composition under the same conditions and the welldocumented ability to introduce large numbers of oxygen
vacancies into both structures.23,24 CaMnO3 and its reduced
counterpart have been well-studied for oxygen evolution and
reduction,25–29 however, only once CaMnO3 been studied as an
electrochemical anion-based pseudocapacitor to our knowledge.21 Upon annealing of the as-synthesized materials in
a reducing atmosphere to introduce increased amounts of
oxygen vacancies, both reduced materials displayed greater
charge storage compared to their unreduced counterparts,
demonstrating how greater oxygen vacancy concentrations
within the bulk of these materials increases their ability to store
charge via oxide anion-based intercalation. Furthermore, we
demonstrate how the governing descriptor for pseudocapacitive
performance changes from a dependence on the number of
surface transition metal redox active sites and oxygen vacancies
at fast charge/discharge rates versus at slower rates where
improved oxygen diffusion through the bulk lattice dominates.
Finally, we demonstrate how both materials may be implemented into an asymmetric pseudocapacitor cell utilizing both
reduced manganese materials as cathodes and brownmillerite
SrFeO2.5 as the anode to achieve impressive performance at
varying charge and discharge rates"
194-intro.txt.txt,"Global energy crisis, the depletion of fossil fuels, and the ever
increasing environmental pollution have all led to an urgent
search of efcient, clean, and sustainable alternative energy
supply and storage. Moreover, due to the increased power
demand worldwide, there has been a need to develop high
power and high energy devices that are robust and are able to
withstand hundreds and thousands of charging/discharging
cycles without being degraded. In recent years, electrochemical capacitors, also known as ultracapacitors and supercapacitors, have attracted signifcant attention, mainly due to
their promising properties: higher power density than batteries, higher energy density than conventional capacitors,
fast charging-discharging rates, and prolonged cycle life [1].
Supercapacitors are characterized as electric double-layer
capacitors (EDLC) and pseudocapacitors. Electrical energy
storage in EDLC occurs at the phase boundary between the
electrode (active material) and the electrolyte solution (liquid
ionic conductor) [2] with no charge-transfer involvement.
Electrodes that use the current generated by the displacement
of current due to charge rearrangement are known as ideally
polarized electrodes [3, 4]. As for pseudocapacitors, charge
storage is caused by the fast faradaic redox reaction due to

Nanostructured materials have drawn great interest in
the feld of supercapacitors as they ofer a combination of
nanoscale dimensions with highly defned geometry and high
surface areas. Titania has been considered as the best candidate for many applications over the past few decades due to its
remarkable properties and strikingly high potential for practical applications [6–9]. Recently, titania nanotubes have been
of much interest in energy storage owing to their capacity of
being able to ofer large surface areas and greatly improved
electron transfer pathways compared to nonoriented structures, which in turn led to a higher charge propagation
in active materials [6, 10, 11]. Among the various methods
reported for the synthesis of titania nanotubes, the electrochemical anodization method has been the most promising
method as its ofers suitably back-connected nanotubes on
the Ti foil substrate which can be used directly as a binder-free
supercapacitor electrode [12]. However, TNT electrodes suffer from very low specifc capacitance (less than 1 mF cm−2)
due to their poor electrical conductivity, which are similar to
conventional electric double-layer capacitors [13, 14].
Te enhancement of the capacitive performance of the
TNTs can be carried out by electrochemical approaches
and thermal treatments. Salari et al. (2011) reported the
remarkable specifc capacitance of the modifed TNTs by
thermal treatment optimization under an argon atmosphere
[13]. Te annealing process in a low oxygen atmosphere
induced the evolution of oxygen vacancies that improved the
specifc capacitance. Tey disclosed that the highest specifc
capacitance of 2.6 mF cm−2 was obtained at 600∘
C which
was higher than the previously reported capacitance of TiO2
(100–911  F cm−2) [6, 13]. Besides argon, Endut et al. reported
a specifc capacitance of 0.118 mF cm−2 for titania nanotubes
optimized by thermal treatment in ammonia (NH3) [15]. It
was concluded that by reducing the Ti4+ to Ti3+ during NH3
annealing, the electrochemical performance of the sample
was enhanced.
However, a simple, fast and cost-efective approach in
modifying the TNTs for enhancing their electrochemical
properties is much more desirable. Macak et al. reported that
the higher conductivity layer at the bottom of the titania
nanotubes layers formed by a reductive doping process [16].
Tis simple electrochemical method could be carried out in
ambient temperatures and required simple preparation steps.
In the doping process, Ti4+ was reduced to Ti3+ which acted as
a donor center resulting in a highly conducting barrier layer
[16–19]. Tey claimed that only 1% of the Ti4+ in the titania
nanotubes layers could be reduced to Ti3+ and the color
change in the flms from light grey to black was a side efect of
the reductive doping process. In this study, the focus was on
utilizing the electrochemical reduction method to fabricate
R-TNTs that meet the requirements as efective electrodes for
supercapacitor applications."
195-intro.txt.txt,"Electrochemical supercapacitors fabricated using nanostructures play a crucial role in overcoming the demand for energy
consumption and its storage.1−3 Considerable attention in the
field of electrochemical supercapacitors has been drawn in
recent years due to their high specific power, longer cycle life
and, the capability of forming a bridge between conventional
capacitors and battery/fuel cells. The major fields where the
supercapacitors can be utilized are the textiles industry,
electronics industry, hybrid vehicles, and energy generators,
etc.
4,5
Along with supercapacitors, some other conventional energy
storage devices are batteries which work on the mechanism of
reversible oxidation and reduction of an electrolyte with the
metallic electrode depending on the affinity of the metal of the
electrode. Due to the slow propagation of ions, it gives high
energy density but a deficit in terms of power density. The
large specific capacitance of these devices on their electrode/
electrolyte interfaces is due to the associated kinetics of two
mechanisms: (1) EDLC (electrochemical double-layer capacitance), which is a nonfaradaic process, and (2) pseudocapacitance, which is a faradaic process. EDLC stores charges by
the action of electrostatic deposition of charges forming a
double layer on the electrode. It mostly depends on the
exposed surface area of the electrode. Pseudocapacitors store
charges by the action of reverse redox reaction which maintains
the energy density of the electrode material comparable to the
batteries without compromising the power density but lacks in
terms of poor electronic conductivity and cycle life.
The rapid growth taking place in the field of material science
incorporates the development of hybrid nanomaterials6−10
where the size and shape can be manipulated by varying the
synthesis methods. These hybrid materials by the action of the
synergistic activity of two or more distinct nanomaterials into
one unit are an efficient way for the enhancement of the
properties by altering the electrical11,12 and chemical properties.13
Tungsten oxides are very much explored as a pseudocapacitor material due to the high electrical conductivity and
different phases. The materials having multiple phases are
suitable for ion mobility in electrochemical activities. The
electrochemical features of the nanostructure favor its
applications in the field of sensors, field emission, electrochromic devices, and photocatalysis. The monoclinic structure
of tungsten oxide with multiple oxidation states has an oxygen
deficiency which helps to reduce the resistivity and enhances
the electrochemical features.14

high theoretical capacitance (1300−2200 F/g) and conductivity (105 S/cm). The most desirable properties are its

worthy for electrochemical applications and, hence, widely
studied across the world.15,16 Even after having several
attractive properties, this material is far away from industrial
applications due to disadvantages such as agglomeration, low
intrinsic resistance, and weak conductivity in the nano regime
that make it unfit in terms of the experimental specific
capacitance.17 Besides this, the material is expensive because of
its low abundance. So to minimize these unfavorable features,
the focus has been shifted toward combining RuO2 with some
other nanomaterial which is expected to compensate for the
undesirable properties. Earlier, the effect of the combination of
RuO2 with carbon-based material, such as activated carbon,18
graphene,16 carbon nanotubes,19 and carbon aerogels,20 etc.
was reported. The electrochemical result has also been
reported where Deng et al. attained charge storage of 479 F/
g by RuO2/graphene hybrid material.21 Again, Amir et al. have
synthesized RuO2/rGO by a sol−gel process and achieved a
specific capacitance of 509 F/g.22 Zheng et al. has obtained a
specific capacitance of 768 F/g from the amorphous RuO2. In
the literature based on RuO2, it is found that amorphous RuO2
plays a significant role in supercapacitor electrodes with high
energy and power density.23,24
Here, we have synthesized W18O49 hybridized with RuO2
nanostructures on carbon paper substrate and measured the
electrochemical energy storage properties. The RuO2 nanoparticles were homogeneously coated on the W18O49 nanorods
which are considered as favorable for the electrochemical
activity by changing the kinetics mechanism. Ruthenium oxide
has been considered to be the most important for practical
implementations due to its superior reversibility and highvalued specific capacitance together with the very long cycle
life. It is reported that ruthenium oxide, RuO2, has outstanding
electrocatalytic features for several electrochemical processes.
The hybrid nanostructure exhibited the synergistic and
interfacial effect between the W18O49 nanorods and RuO2
nanoparticles. The combined effect of both the morphologies
revealed huge structural importance by demonstrating its
tendency to be oxidized and also by offering augmentation or
the process of strengthening each other, which affects the
energy storage capacity. It is also widely accepted that hybrid
components, both W18O49 and RuO2, are the best choices for
practical electrochemical applications, and also they perform
well in a corrosive H2SO4 environment. Indeed, the
commercially available RuO2 is costly. We have tried to
minimize the cost of the ultimate product by synthesizing
RuO2 using precursor ruthenium chloride whose price is half
that of RuO2. This process also helps in synthesizing the
desirable morphologies which are very important for electrochemical characteristics. For investigating the simplicity and
low cost of the synthesis approach, we have used the
hydrothermal/solvothermal approach which is again less costly
as compared to other deposition approaches. Also, we have
used a carbon substrate and drop-casting approach to make the
electrode which is an economical approach. For comparison,
we have also synthesized W18O49 and RuO2 separately and
have compared the result. Here it revealed that the battery type
W18O49 material transformed to pseudocapacitor by RuO2
nanoparticles decoration. Thus, the hybrid heterostructures
disclose their potential application as the supercapacitor with
high charge storage, low cost, high long stability, etc. These
results are very interesting, important, and studied for the first
time."
196-intro.txt.txt,"The booming portable electronics, electric vehicles (EV), and
hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) trigger broad requirements of
electrochemical energy storage devices (EES), such as Li+ ion
batteries (LIBs) and supercapacitors (SCs). These energy storage devices are always expected to provide high power/energy
densities, long lifespan, and low cost [1–3]. However, LIBs
face low power density and limited cycle stability caused by
the Li+ (de) intercalation reactions [4–7]. Compared to LIBs,
SCs such as electrochemical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs)
due to the non-Faraday surface reaction are normally limited
by low energy density [8, 9]. In the Ragone plot, lithium ion
capacitors (LICs) are another promising strategy; such asymmetric supercapacitors combine two different types of electrodes in which the double-layer capacitive electrode acts as
the cathode and the pseudocapacitive or Faradic material is the
anode [10–12]. Due to the integrated energy storage mechanism, LICs could output high energy density, high power density as well as strong cycle stability. And just because of this
integrated mechanism, the sluggish kinetics of the anode still
limits the performance of LICs [13, 14].
According to the reaction mechanism, the anode materials
can be broadly divided into three types: (de) intercalation reaction, alloy/de-alloy reaction, and conversion reaction [15].
Intercalation reaction refers to the reversible insertion of materials, such as Li+ into the crystal structure which contains empty
lattice sites, while the main lattice maintains structural integrity,
leading to high reversibility and energy efficiency. Alloy anode
can provide super high capacity, but the large volume change
(> 300%) causes a poor cycle performance. The conversion
type is accompanied by a large electrode polarization during
its (dis) charging processes, resulting in a low energy efficiency.
However, state-of-art intercalation anodes fall behind the fastgrowing development of LICs with requirements of high rate
capability and long cyclic life. For example, graphite suffers
from the issues of poor rate capability and safety risk derived

from the low reaction potential. Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) with a relatively high lithiation/delithiation plateau significantly sacrifices
the energy density of the device. Therefore, the intercalation
anodes should be further developed.
Except for graphite and LTO, Li3VO4 (LVO) has been reported as a new promising insertion anode recently, owing to
its safe voltage range (0.5–1.0 V vs. Li+
/Li) and up to
394 mAh g−1 theoretical specific capacity. Although it is a fast
ionic conductor that is preferred for ion transport during a
redox reaction, its low electronic conductivity always causes
a large electrode polarization, deteriorating the intrinsic performance [16]. Many methods have been developed to improve its electrochemical property, such as increasing the activity by reducing the particle size and improving electrical
conductivity by carbon composite or coating [17–21]. The
solution-based methods can get sufficiently small particles,
but probably cause impure phases such as V4O9 [22] and
LiVO3 [23]. Carbon composites can enhance the electronic
conductivity of LVO, thus achieving excellent rate and cycling properties; however, in order to ensure a good conductive coating, a high amount of carbon is always required,
which will greatly sacrifice the volumetric energy density of
the cell [24, 25].
Considering the electrochemical kinetics of the anode,
there are two primary types of processes controlling the reaction, namely, diffusion-controlled intercalation process and
surface-induced capacitive process, according to a power
law relationship. LVO with a fast ionic conductivity should
enable a fast diffusion process; given that the surface-induced
capacitive contribution can be improved, we believe that LVO
is suitable for LIC as high-performance anode materials.
Herein, we proposed a straightforward strategy to tailor the
capacitive contribution ratio of the LVO anode by a highenergy ball milling that is widely adopted in the fundamental
research and industrial production. LVO was prepared by a
solid-state reaction, which is a convenient and cost-effective
method to obtain a pure phase for large-scale production [16].
Microstructures and electrochemical performances of LVO
anode were characterized; in particular, the electrochemical
kinetics was analyzed to quantify the surface-induced capacitive contribution ratio. LICs based on the LVO anode and
activated carbon (AC) cathode were assembled,
outperforming that of several literatures. The results could
provide a technical strategy by tailoring the electrochemical
kinetics process to boost the performance of LICs."
198-intro.txt.txt,"Supercapacitors as energy storage devices have attracted
extensive attention because of their high power density and
long cycle life.1,2 However, inherent low energy density hinders
its practical application.3,4 Transition-metal oxides (such as
Fe2O3,
5 MnO2,
6 Co3O4,
7 RuO2,
8 NiO9
) as a pseudocapacitance
electrode material are often chosen to enhance the energy
density due to their rapid surface or near-surface redox reaction.
As a typical representative of transition-metal oxides, MnO2 is
widely used as a positive electrode material because of its low
cost, wide potential window, and high theoretical specific
capacity.10 Unfortunately, the low conductivity and unstable
structure limit its application in supercapacitors.11 Some
strategies are adopted to ameliorate these shortcomings; for
instance, the introduction of conductive materials (graphene,12
rGO,13 CNTs,14 MXenes,15,16 conductive MOFs17,18) with a
large surface can improve the conductivity of MnO2 bulk and
provide more electrochemical reaction sites, or the construction
of heterostructures (MnOx@C@MnOx,
19 α-MnO2 nanowires@LDH,20 MnO2@PPy21) can prevent the structural
collapse of MnO2 during the charging/discharging process.
Moreover, the dimensional regulation strategy for MnO2
materials (MnO2 nanospheres,22 single-layer ultrathin MnO2
nanosheets,23 ultrafine MnO2 nanowires,24 ultrasmall deltaMnO2 nanoflowers25) can also exhibit superior electrochemical
performance and structural stability.26 However, their synthesis
process is often complex and involves high energy consumption,
and the material yield is low. Therefore, it is necessary to obtain
MnO2 materials with high electrochemical activity by a simple,
efficient, and low energy consumption reaction.
In addition, it is well known that the pseudocapacitance
behavior of MnO2 in a neutral electrolyte mainly depends on the
intercalation of H+ and M+ (metal ions in the electrolyte) to
produce MnOOH/M, as shown in the following electrochemical reaction formula.27−29

However, the above charge storage process for MnO2 electrode
materials is not suitable for alkaline electrolytes due to the
presence of few H+ ions. Therefore, it is imperative to investigate
the charge storage mechanism and the corresponding structural
transformation process of MnO2 electrode materials in alkaline
electrolytes and further improve their capacity decay.
Herein, a stable MnO2@rGO core−shell structure with
graphene coated evenly on the surface of flowerlike MnO2
nanospheres is first prepared via a liquid−liquid interface
deposition further combined with the electrostatic self-assembly
method under low temperatures. The MnO2@rGO electrode
exhibits a high specific capacitance of 378 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in a 6
M KOH solution and excellent cycling stability of 89.5% after
10 000 cycles at 10 A g−1
. Meanwhile, according to ex situ X-ray
diffraction (XRD), Raman characterizations, and density
functional theory (DFT) calculations, it was found that the
presence of oxygen vacancies formed due to the lengthening of
the Mn−O bond and loss of oxygen with K+ ion intercalation
can induce the phase transition from layered-MnO2 to spinelMn3O4 in the first discharging process. As the cycling number
increases, the spinel-Mn3O4 phase is gradually adjusted to a
more stable λ-MnO2 with a three-dimensional tunnel structure,
finally realizing reversible intercalation/deintercalation of K+
ions in the λ-MnO2 crystal structure in the subsequent charge
storage process. Moreover, an all-solid-state symmetric microsupercapacitor based on MnO2@rGO materials is fabricated via
the mask-assisted vacuum filtration method, exhibiting an areal
capacitance of 20.2 mF cm−2 and an energy density of 1.01 μWh

nearly no capacity decay after 8700 cycles."
199-intro.txt.txt,"For the past few decades, the rapid development of the global 
economy and the sustained growth of the world’s population have 
aggravated the rapid-speed consumption of non-renewable resources, 
causing increasingly serious crises of energy. To address these issues, 
people have been developing a series of energy storage devices. Supercapacitors (SCs), also known as electrochemical capacitors, have 
attracted intensive research interest due to their excellent performances 
such as high-power density, long life cycle and fast charge/discharge 
features [1–2]. The current close research work mainly focuses on the 
structural design and preparation of different types of electrode materials such as carbon, transition metal oxides (TMOs) and conducting 
polymers [3–6]. For them, the processing and preparation of their 
electrodes are mainly traditional preparation methods using nonconductive binders and inactive conductive carbon black additives. In 
fact, this traditional method has many drawbacks, for example, the 
interface compatibility between active materials, additives and substrates is difficult to match, resulting in poor dispersion and weak 
interface force, in addition, non-conductive adhesives increase electrode 
resistance and the inactive conductive agent reduces specific capacitance [7–10]. Therefore, the electrode processing technology of active 
materials plays a key role in the performances of SCs. 
TMOs such as MnO2 [11], RuO2 [12–13] and Co3O4 [14] usually 
show satisfactory electrochemical performance because of their characteristic crystal structure, the multiple oxidation states of metal ions 
and rapid redox capacity, all of which are beneficial to excellent charge 
storage capability. As a pivotal role of TMOs family, tungsten trioxide 
(WO3), resulting from its intrinsic merits such as high theoretical specific capacitance, low cost and environmental friendliness, have been 
extensively employed for electrochromic devices, photoanode material, 
fuel cells, SCs and Li-ion batteries. As the electrode material of SCs, 
various nanostructural WO3-based materials and their electrode preparation have been researched [15–16]. For instance, Salkar et al. fabricated oxygen-vacancy WO3/C nanorods with area specific capacitance 
of 401 mF cm− 2 at 2 mA cm− 2

composites by microwave irradiation method, and then dropped WO3/ 
CeO2 composites onto the glassy carbon (GC) surface using Nafion as a 
binder, however, as-reported WO3/CeO2 electrode showed a very low 
specific capacitance of 52 F g− 1 at 0.1 A g− 1 [18]. The conventional 
fabrication of electrode has drawbacks, that is, the addition of nonconductive binder leads to the resistance increase of electrode, 
reducing the capacitive performance of the active material. In order to 
improve the capacitance performance of the WO3 nanomaterials, a 
method of WO3 nanomaterials directly growing on a conductive substrate has also been proposed [19–20]. For example, Qiu et al. reported 
that the WO3 nanoflowers electrodeposited on Ti foil exhibited an areal 
specific capacitance of 658 mF cm− 2 [21]. Huang et al. prepared WO3 
nanorods, nanoplates and microspheres grown on stainless steel substrate by a hydrothermal method, which exhibited an areal capacitance 
of 100.35, 10.25 and 751.40 mF cm− 2 at 10 mV s
− 1
, respectively [22]. 
Yao and his coworkers reported oxygen-vacancy WO3 nanowires and 
C@WO3 nanowires deposited on carbon cloth substrate via a sample 
hydrothermal approach and their areal capacitance were 336.2 and 
786.8 mF cm− 2 at 20 mV s
− 1
, respectively [23]. Yin et al. fabricated a 
mesoporous WO3 nanosheets with exposed (200) facets anchored on 
carbon cloth, the best areal capacitance of as-obtained WO3 electrode 
was 659 mF cm− 2 at 5 mA cm− 2 [24]. Although the WO3 grown directly 
on the conductive substrate can indeed greatly reduce the contact 
resistance, the low intrinsic conductivity of WO3 itself still leads to the 
hindrance of electron transfer in the bulk phase, therefore have difficult 
in achieving the desired capacitive performance. Alternately assembly of 
WO3-based electrodes has also been reported for obtaining satisfactory 
areal specific capacitance, for example, a multi-layer WO3/V2O5/WO3/ 
V2O5 electrode deposited alternately by magnetron sputtering had an 
areal capacitance of 1165 mF cm− 2 [25]. However, this magnetron 
sputtering method is complicated and costly, and it is not conducive to 
large-scale preparation. Apart from this, the electron transport in the 
overall electrode material is still greatly restricted due to the low conductivity of WO3/V2O5. 
As a typical rare earth oxide, CeO2 has drawn intensive attention due 
to its environment friendly, low price and electrochemical redox feature 
[26]. Ce(III) and Ce(IV) ions in CeO2 can quickly interconvert and the 
increasing content of Ce(III) can accelerate electron transport and ion 
diffusion thus improve capacitive performance, making it an important 
supercapacitor material [27–29]. In addition, composites based CeO2 
can show good electrochemcial performance [30–32]. Therefore, in 
order to solve the above unfavorable problems and boost the development of high-performance nanostructural WO3-based materials in the 
high-power energy resources, in this work, we construct and demonstrate an innovative high-efficiency structure electrode composed of 
porous layers of WO3-based nanowires coated on poly(3,4- 
ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) modified GC surface and permeated with an interconnected conductive layer of poly(3,4- 
ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS). The advantages of this design are mainly reflected in the following aspects. (1) 
The PEDOT thin layer electrodeposited on GC has porous structure 
(Fig. S1), high conductivity and is strongly fixed on the surface of GC, 
which increases the specific surface area of the electrode on the one 
hand, and on the other hand anchors the WO3-based nanowires by 
interfacial force, which is mainly the electrostatic interaction between 
W cation and the anion SO3- in PEDOT:PSS [33] and between the S atom 
on thiophene ring and WO3-based nanowires [34]; (2) Solutionprocessed PEDOT:PSS with high conductivity and interface compatibility can permeate into the porous layer of WO3-based nanowires to act 
as a conductive connection, additionally, the PEDOT:PSS layer can 
effectively avoid the dissolution and shedding of WO3-based nanowires. 
The WO3 and WO3-CeO2 hybrid nanowires were synthesized by a simple 
hydrothermal method firstly using L-cysteine as a structure directing 
agent and reducing agent. The diameter of as-prepared nanowires was 
about 10 nm, which was smaller than that reported in the literature 
(100–200 nm). As expected, the designed structure electrode, PEDOT: 
PSS/WO3-CeO2/PEDOT/GC, exhibited ultrahigh areal specific capacitance of 1310 mF cm− 2 at 2 mA cm− 2
. The asymmetric supercapacitor 
(ASC) based on PEDOT:PSS/WO3-CeO2/PEDOT and PEDOT:PSS/RuO2/ 
PEDOT electrodes can be operated at a high working voltage of 1.6 V, 
delivering an energy density of 0.61 Wh m− 2 (20.9 Wh kg− 1
) at power 
density of 8.22 W m− 2 (801.6 W kg− 1
). Such simple and easy structure 
design will be promising to be used to improve the capacitance performance of various active materials and be expected to replace traditional 
electrode preparation methods for SCs. "
200-intro.txt.txt,"With the widespread use of renewable energy, the growing electric
vehicle market, and rapidly developing portable electronics,
reliable electrochemical energy storage equipment is needed to
meet the needs of the above technology.1,2 A supercapacitor is a
promising new type of energy storage device due to its power
density, fast charge and discharge process, and long cycle
stability.3 However, low energy density severely limits the wide
application of supercapacitors. Possessing greater energy density
without sacrificing power density is a development trend of
supercapacitors.4
To obtain higher energy density, a scheme of combining
battery-type Faraday electrodes and electrochemical doublelayer capacitor-type electrodes in a hybrid supercapacitor was
proposed.5 In hybrid supercapacitors, electrochemical doublelayer capacitor electrodes are usually made of activated carbon.
The battery type Faraday electrodes are made of pseudocapacitive materials, which can provide additional charge storage
capacity through the surface redox process to improve the
energy storage capacity.6,7 In order to obtain a higher specific
capacity, it is necessary to find a high-capacity pseudocapacitance material, such as transition metal oxide,8,9 hydroxide,10,11
sulfide,12 phosphide,13 etc. Notably, NiCo2O4, regarded as
partial substitution of Co atoms by Ni atoms,14 has a similar
crystal structure to Co3O4, and its conductivity is higher than
that of Co3O4.
15 Furthermore, due to the co-existence of Co3+/
Co4+ and Ni2+/Ni3+ redox couples, NiCo2O4 exhibits a promising
electrochemical performance and has attracted widespread
attention.16,17 For example, the Zhao group designed NiCo2O4
active materials on the Ni fabric using an electrodeposition
method, which displayed an admirable specific capacitance of
about 725.7 F g1 at 1 A g1
, which remained at 70% after
cycling 5000 times.18 R. B. Waghmode group reported the
preparation of NiCo2O4 nanoflowers on flexible stainless steel
(FSS) substrate, which showed an excellent specific capacitance
about 702 F g1 at 1 A g1
.
19 Nevertheless, pronounced
volumetric expansion usually limits the practical applications
of electrode materials.
Hollow structures can not only reduce the diffusion time of
ions/electrons from the surface to the core,1 but also provide
additional free space to adapt to volume changes during the

electrochemical process, bringing about a great cycling
stability.20 These advantages lead hollow structure materials
to tremendous achievements in electrocatalysts,21 lithium-ion
batteries,22 and supercapacitors.23 Great efforts have been
made to engineer the hollow morphology. Amiri et al. successfully synthesized hierarchical nanosheet-based MnCoP hollow
nanocubes by a hard and soft acid–base (HSAB) approach.24 Li
et al. fabricated bimetal phosphides NiCoP with hollow mesoporous structures by template etching and phosphorization
treatment procedure.13 Because of the facile process and high
reproducibility, the self-template method is widely adopted to
prepare complex hollow structures usually based on Ostwald
ripening mechanism25,26 or Kirkendall effect.27
In addition, introducing vacancies in electrode materials is
another effective option for enhancing their electrochemical
performance.17,23,28 Metal oxides with oxygen vacancies (Vo)
display better conductivity and higher capacitance.29 At the
same time, oxygen vacancies can better adsorb OH and
accelerate surface reaction kinetics.30 Fu group successfully
fabricated MnO2 microspheres with oxygen vacancies, displaying an outstanding specific capacitance (452.4 F g1 at 1 A g1
)
and cycling stability (92.2% retention after 10 000 cycles).31
Chen et al. reported the synthesis of TiO2x with rich oxygen
vacancies through a facile spray-pyrolysis-assisted method, and
the TiO2x demonstrated a high capacity (230.7 mA h g1 at
0.05 A g1
).32 P-Vo-NiCo2O4 exhibited a higher double-layer
capacitance and high-efficiency water splitting performance
due to the existence of oxygen vacancies and mesoporous
structure.33 Up to now, engineering materials with vacancies
are still a hot topic in electrochemistry.
Here, using the Ni–Co complex compound as a selftemplate, urchin-like NiCo2O4 hollow microspheres with oxygen vacancies are prepared by a one-pot solvothermal treatment
with annealing in air. It suggests that the Ostwald ripening
process governed the production of this urchin-like nanostructure. The internal voids of the hollow urchin-like structure can
provide more buffer space during the electrochemical process,
shorten ions transmission distance, enlarge the BET, and
expose more reaction sites. Moreover, the nanowires arranged
vertically on the outside can act as a conductive skeleton for
further improving the performance.34 Owing to the synergistic
of oxygen vacancies and hollow nanostructure, the obtained
urchin-like NiCo2O4 exhibits excellent capacitance and durable
cycling stability. The constructed asymmetric supercapacitor
device also delivers high energy density. This effective strategy
for preparing urchin-like hollow structures can be used to
prepare transition metal compounds for extensive fields."

Generally, transition metal oxides/hydroxides (such as
MnO2, NiO, Co3O4, NiCo2O4, and CoMoO4) and conductive polymers (including polyaniline and polypyrrole) are
used in pseudocapacitors.13-18 Researchers have used various methods to obtain many exquisite nanostructures.19
Among them, important methods for preparing various
nanostructures include the hydrothermal method,
solvothermal method, microwave radiation method, coprecipitation method, and sol-gel method.20-22 Nanorods,
nanowires, nanoflowers, and cotton-like nanostructures
have been successfully synthesized in many research
works, and from an application point of view, they are considered promising.23-26 Among these metal oxides, cobalt
oxide has its own unique advantages. Large theoretical specific capacitance, high redox activity, and good reversibility
are the main characteristics of cobalt oxide. The theoretical
specific capacitance is approximately 3560 F g1
.
27
As a typical battery material, NiCo2O4
28-32 has
attracted wide attention due to its unique Ni-Co synergistic effect, low cost, rich resources, and environmental
benefits. Because the hydrothermal method is simple,
low cost, and easy to operate, it is a good choice for the
synthesis of NiCo2O4 in various synthesis methods.
The reaction mechanism of NiCo2O4 can be expressed by
the following Equation33:
Ni2þ þ2Co2þ þ6OH ¼ NiCo2ð Þ OH 6 ð1Þ
2NiCo2ð Þ OH 6 þO2 ¼ 2NiCo2O4 þ6H2O ð2Þ
According to the equation, the alkaline substance is
mainly used as a precipitant to form nickel and cobalt
hydroxide. Padmanathan and Yu et al34,35 used alkaline
precipitation agents (urea, sodium hydroxide) to synthesize urchin-like NiCo2O4 hollow microspheres and the
core-ring structure of NiCo2O4 nanosheets.
However, the morphology has not been well explored
through the research based on the hydrothermal selfassembly process. In view of this, this article studies the
electrochemical performance of NiCo2O4 with different
morphologies. Using urea as the hydrolysis agent,
NiCo2O4 with different nanostructures was prepared in
the aqueous solution by the template-free hydrothermal
method. By changing the synthesis parameters (urea content), the morphology and the structure of the products
could be changed. The urea content in the starting mixture has a profound influence on the NiCo2O4 morphology. With a certain urea content, NiCo2O4 has a porous
structure and a large surface area, and NiCo2O4 nanostructured synthetic urchin-like materials exhibit excellent electrochemical characteristics. Compared with the
previous work, we found an interesting phenomenon for
the first time that the content of internal elements
changes as the morphology of the material changes. This
may be one of the factors that affect the morphology.
This work provides some theoretical data for the next
step to explore the relationship between the element and
the morphology"
203-intro.txt.txt,"Supercapacitors (SCs) are a new type of energy storage device with
properties between Li-batteries and conventional capacitors.
Because of their high power density, high charging/discharging
rate, wide working temperature range, remarkable cycle stability
and excellent reliability,1–3 SCs are used as a promising complement or alternative to batteries for applications of high power
output or fast energy harvesting, such as electric vehicles,4–6 rail
transits,7,8wind power generation9 and photovoltaic generation.10,11
SCs are mechanically divided into electric double layer
capacitors (EDLCs) and pseudocapacitors, which exhibit
different advantages and disadvantages in terms of performance. EDLCs use carbon materials as electrode materials.
There is only the physical electrostatic adsorption and desorption process during the energy storage process of them, and the
capacitance retention is above 95% aer thousands or even tens
of thousands of cycles.12–16 On the other side, pseudocapacitors
mainly use metallic materials and their compounds. Metal
oxides are the most common pseudocapacitor materials with
excellent electrochemical properties. Metal suldes and selenides are also of interest because of their special properties.17–22
The energy storage process is dominated by Faraday redox
reactions. Although redox reactions result in the high energy
density of pseudocapacitors, they may induce the intrinsic
instability of some pseudocapacitor materials that undermining the cycle stability of pseudocapacitors.23 It means that
the cycle life of pseudocapacitors is usually worse than that of
EDLCs, which is a major obstacle to practical application.
Among metal oxides, perovskite-type oxides are competitive
candidates for pseudocapacitor materials.24,25 The structural
stability of perovskite-type oxides makes them have high cycle
stability as electrode materials, while the existence of oxygen
vacancies improves their capacitance performance. That is,
perovskite-type oxide may simultaneously achieve high stability
and high capacitance. However, the cycle stability of many
perovskite-type oxides as electrode materials is not as excellent
as excepted. The specic capacitance of electrodes decreases to
below 90% (ref. 26–29) or even below 80% (ref. 30–33) aer
thousands of cycles. The widely accepted criteria denes the
end-of-life of a supercapacitor when the capacitance retention is
less than 80% or the internal resistance is doubled.34,35 The
composite method is an effective way to improve the cycle
stability of these electrode materials. For example, LaNiO3/NiO
composite36 and LSC@MnO2 core/shell nanorods37 have the
capacitance retention of over 95% aer thousands of cycles.
And how to improve the inherent cycle stability of perovskitetype oxides is also an important issue.
In terms of practicality, cycle stability is indeed a critical
issue and challenge for supercapacitors. Briat et al. studied the
ageing quantication of supercapacitors in terms of evolution
of capacitance and equivalent series resistance, and proposed
an online characterisation procedure to deal with the regeneration phenomenon during the rest period.38 And they studied
the performance fading of supercapacitors under calendar life
and power cycling tests, and conrmed that the two types of
ageing tests affected the supercapacitor performances

differently.39 During the calendar life tests, deposit of impurities
on the surface of the electrodes limit the access of ions to the
porous structure and lead to a decrease of the capacitance.
While during the power cycling tests, the impurities accumulated more inside the electrodes, which drastically modied the
structure of the electrodes and degraded the homogeneity of the
cells. Summarizing several studies on the life model of supercapacitors, Liu et al. gave a general form of different lifetime
models of supercapacitors with three critical stressors of
temperature, voltage and current.40 The failure mechanisms of
EDLCs include the reaction of impurities in the electrode with
the electrolyte, solvent decomposition, electrolyte evaporation,
electrolyte ions intercalation into and damaging the electrode.
Julien et al. reported that the two main causes for degradation of
MnO2 based pseudocapacitors are Mn3+ generation during the
redox process and Mn2+ dissolution in the electrolyte.41 And
similar to EDLCs, the electrolyte decomposition and evaporation under harsh conditions also lead to the failure of
pseudocapacitors.42
LaCoO3 is a typical perovskite-type oxide. Guo et al. reported
that the etched LaCoO3 exhibits high capacitance performance
as electrode material and the LaCoO3//GO device shows excellent cycling performance.43 Nevertheless, it is still necessary to
study and discuss the cycle stability of LaCoO3 electrodes. In
this paper, in order to study the degradation of LaCoO3 more
accurately and eliminate the inuence of GO electrodes,
LaCoO3-based symmetric supercapacitors are taken as the
research object. The effect of potential window and current
density on the performance degradation of devices is studied
through the cycling test. By analyzing the changes of electrochemical performance, material element valence distribution
and electrolyte composition before and aer the test, the
degradation mechanism of devices is obtained. Results show
that the occurrence and accumulation of irreversible redox
reactions reduce the number of oxygen vacancies in LaCoO3
electrodes then lead to the performance degradation of the
pseudocapacitors"
204-intro.txt.txt,"In recent years, the problem of air contamination has arisen as a result of the excessive use of 
fossil sources for energy production [1]. In addition, there are concerns about the energy supply 
for cell phones, tablets, portable medical devices, etc, due to the increasing demand for these 
devices and to the incorporation of them on clothes, which is a popular trend. Therefore, the 
development of new, efficient and low-cost technologies to store energy in wearable/portable is 
very significant today [2]. In fact, the growing market demands these technologies for smart and 
compact electronic devices. Currently, lithium ion batteries (LIBs) and cylindrical 
supercapacitors (SCs) are used as energy sources in smart TV, tablets, cell phones, etc [3]. 
However, these devices present problems such as: i) poor recyclability, ii) high weight, iii) 
rigidity, and iv) toxicity (corrosive/explosive electrolytes). Due to these disadvantages, their use 
as energy source in wearable technologies is very limited. 
On the other hand, flexible SCs have emerged as a potential source of energy because they save 
space for portable electronic applications and can support high mechanical stress [4]. Those 
devices are provoking a revolution in electronics because they are becoming essential for the 
development of applications such as flexible cell phones, flexible displays, electronic skins and 
implantable medical devices [5]. Furthermore, flexible SCs are also considered strong candidates 
to substitute the LIBs due to their characteristics of: i) high power density, ii) high coulombic 
efficiency, iii) long half-life, and iv) fast charge/discharge rates. All these characteristics make 
the flexible SCs highly promising for their use in smart/wearable electronic devices [6]. 
Following this ultimate trend, Weng et al. [7] have developed flexible solid state SCs using as 
electrodes a cellulose graphene paper, reaching a maximum capacitance of 46 mF cm-2 while 
maintaining a capacitance retention >99% after 5000 cycles of charge/discharge. Moreover, 
3 
Chen et al. [8], developed solid-state yarn supercapacitors assembled from hybrid poly(vinyl 
alcohol)/graphene fibers, which demonstrated a maximum energy density of 5.97 mW h cm-3 as 
well as high flexibility and bendability. This flexible device can be woven into textiles while 
providing energy. Although these last works have demonstrated that the fabrication of flexible 
and wearable SCs is possible by using electrodes made of polymers (which serve to reinforce 
mechanically the graphene [9]) and graphene, these SCs still have energy densities (10-100 Wh 
kg-1) lower than these for LIBs (100-350 Wh kg-1), limiting their use as energy sources in real 
wearable/portable applications [10]. In order to increase the energy density and capacitance of 
the flexible graphene based SCs, their electrodes should have characteristics such as [11, 12]: 1) 
high specific surface area to favor the presence of active sites, 2) a suitable pore-size and pore 
network to facilitate the ion diffusion into the electrodes, 3) a low internal resistance to 
efficiently transport the charge through the electrodes, and 5) high electrochemical stability for 
good cycling performance. To fulfill the previous requirements, some researchers have designed 
graphene/TiO2 composites as electrodes for SCs. In fact, graphene/TiO2 composites have been 
widely used as advanced photocatalytic materials for the degradation of contaminant dyes such 
rhodamine B (100% degradation after 20 min) [13] and malachite green (85% degradation after 
75 min) [14]. Previous works about graphene/TiO2 electrodes with capacitive properties have 
been reported: Ramados et al. [15] synthesized a graphene/TiO2 electrode using a microwaveassisted technique. This electrode reached a maximum capacitance and energy density of 165 F 
g
−1 and 12.5 Wh kg−1, respectively. The electrode’s capacitance was higher than that obtained for 
graphene (20 F g−1) and TiO2 (110 F g−1) electrodes individually. This electrode also preserved 
90% of its capacitance after 5000 cycles of charge/discharge. Regarding TiO2 based electrodes 
for SC applications, Liu et al. [16] demonstrated that graphene hydrogel/rice-like titanium oxide 
4 
(TiO2) named (RTGH) has high capacitance of 372.3 F g−1 in a three-electrode system and 332.6 
F g−1 in a two-electrode system at a current density of 0.2 A g−1 (1 M of H2SO4 solution as 
electrolyte). The RTGH device reported capacitance retention of 91.4% after 2000 
charge/discharge cycles. Nagaraju et al. [17] showed that graphene/TiO2 electrodes have higher 
capacitance of 585 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 (1 M H2SO4 as electrolyte) compared to TiO2 electrode (66 F 
g
−1), and energy density of 14.25 Wh kg−1
. 
There are only a few investigations about solid state SCs made with carbon-compound/titania. 
Selvakumar et al. [18] fabricated SCs with electrodes of activated carbon/TiO2, which reached a 
maximum capacitance of 122 F g−1, and energy density of 92.74 Wh kg−1. This device exhibited 
capacitance retention of 100% after 5000 cycles of charge/discharge using current densities of 2 -
7 mA cm-2. Another research group developed flexible solid state SCs based on high surface area 
activated carbon and nanofibers of TiO2. The flexible device achieved capacitance of 310 F g-1
(at 0.3 A g-1) with maximum energy density of 43.05 Wh kg-1 [19]. Moreover, the capacitance 
retention of this device was above 98% after 5000 cycles of charge/discharge. Although the 
capacitance values of these electrodes/SC devices made with TiO2 are competitive, their energy 
density (10-100 Wh Kg-1) is still lower in comparison with the LIBs. For this reason, electrodes 
for SCs doped with carbon compounds or TiO2 have emerged as an alternative to improve the 
capacitive properties. Doping can provide additional redox centers for the charge storage or can 
raise the electrical conductivity of titania, which in turn, enhances the charge transport toward 
the SC collectors for electron extraction [20]. Some investigations have been carried out using 
doped carbon or titania. For example, Tian et al. [21] reported electrodes with N-doped porous 
carbon nanofibers which produced a capacitance of 251.2 F g-1 and energy density of 28.3 Wh 
kg-1 (at 0.1 A g-1). Such capacitance was 25% higher than that for non-doped electrodes and the 
5 
N-doped nanofibers presented 99% of capacity retention after 2000 cycles. Similarly, Huang et 
al. [22] synthesized a hierarchical porous N-doped carbon nanofiber electrode and evaluated its 
performance using 6 M KOH aqueous solution as electrolyte. This electrode showed a specific 
capacitance of 289 F g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 and energy density of 10.03 Wh kg-1 with capacitance 
retention of 95.6% after 1000 cycles of charge/discharge. Additionally, Lei et al. [23, 24] 
demonstrated that carbon fiber electrodes doped with N-S and Mn-doped N-containing carbon 
material (originated from natural and renewable biomass) could be used as electrodes for SCs, 
since they exhibited a specific capacitance of 235-272.62 F g-1 (at 1 A g-1) as well as capacitance 
retention of 72-73% after increasing the current density from 1 to 20 A g-1. Chen et al. [25] also 
demonstrated that doping porous TiO2 with carbon enhances the capacitance from 283 to 485 F 
g
-1 (at 1A g−1). TiO2 based electrodes has been also doped with metal ions such as Ni, Mn, and 
Co, producing capacitance values of 220-360 F g-1 and capacitance retention values of 90-98%, 
after 3000-4000 charge/discharge cycles [26-28]. Finally, devices with flexible electrodes based 
on TiO2 such as TiO2/carbon fiber, TiO2/graphene/polypyrrole, and TiO2/rGO/TiO2 with 
capacitances of 392 F g-1 (at 1 A g−1), 201.8 F g-1 (at 5 mV s−1), and 82 F g-1 (at 5 mV s−1) have 
been reported [29-31]. 
On the other hand, Ag nanoparticles (NPs) have emerged as an alternative to enhance the 
capacitance of composite electrodes due to their high electrical conductivity, faradaic behavior, 
and high surface area [32, 33]. In fact, Lokhande et al. [34] reported that Ag NPs can reach a 
maximum capacitance of 424 F g-1 and energy density of 14.04 Wh kg-1. Among the most 
capacitive Ag based electrodes we found: Ag/NiO honeycomb nanoarray (824 F g-1 at 2.5 A g-1) 
[35], Ag QDs/NiMoO4 (3342.7 F g-1 at 1 mV s-1) [36], Ag NPs/MnO2 (272 F g-1 at 10 mV s-1) 
[33] and AgNPs-Polyaniline-graphene/carbon paper (828 F g-1 at 1.5 A g-1) [32]. All those 
6 
electrodes are able to generate density energies of 48-64 Wh kg-1. Adding Ag NPs to solid state 
SCs also produces high capacitance values, devices made with electrodes of N, S-doped 
graphene decorated with Ag nanoparticles [37] or Ag-rGO/Ni(OH)2 composites [38] can produce 
capacitance values in the range of 1000-1230 F g-1, energy densities of 40-42 Wh kg-1 and 
capacitance retention above 90% after 1000 cycles of charge/discharge. Despite the high values 
of capacitance reached with Ag or TiO2 based electrodes/devices, their energy densities are still 
lower in comparison with the commercial LIBs (100-300 Wh kg-1), which limits their use for 
portable applications where the energy needs to be released for long periods of time. Moreover, 
the mentioned devices based on Ag NPs or TiO2 have the following disadvantages: 1) low 
discharge times (1-1500 s), 3) the solid state devices are not flexible, and 3) the architecture of 
the few devices already reported is very complex. Due to these problems, flexible SCs made of 
low cost TiO2, capable to provide long discharge times are still desirable. 
As an effort to make solid state SCs based on TiO2 with high energy density and long discharge 
times, we introduced porous Ag/TiO2 and Ag/N-doped TiO2 nanocomposites on the anodes of 
flexible graphene SCs. Graphene has been selected to fabricate the flexible support (electrodes) 
due to its high electrical conductivity, easy mass production, low cost, performance for heat 
dissipation/transfer and solution based processability [39, 40]. Also, its surface can also be 
chemically modified to produce very high surface areas of 3100 m2
 g-1, pore sizes of 0.6-5 nm 
and capacitances of at least 150 F g-1 [41], whereas TiO2 is an environmental friendly 
semiconductor, easy to synthesize at low cost and abundant. Further, TiO2 can be synthesized 
with oxygen vacancies, porous structure and high surface area (>50 m2
 g
-1) [42], which are 
desirable as redox centers in SCs. To the best of our knowledge, the effect of Ag/TiO2
nanocomposites on the electrochemical performance of graphene based SCs has not been 
7 
studied, these composites have been used only for the photo-degradation of Escherichia Coli 
bacteria under solar light [43] or for the photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange dissolved in 
aqueous solution under UV irradiation [44]. In this work, TiO2 with surface area of 60 m2
 g-1
was synthesized and decorated with Ag NPs (which were selected due to their high electrical 
conductivity). First, a reference flexible graphene SC without Ag/TiO2 nanocomposite was made 
and presented a poor capacitance and energy density values of 19.1 F g-1 and 3.8 Wh kg-1
, 
respectively. Later, the Ag/TiO2 nanocomposite was introduced in the SC anode and obtained 
outstanding capacitance and energy density values of 1193.2 F g-1 and 238.4 Wh kg-1
, 
respectively. Those values are the highest values reported so far with respect to previous works 
about electrodes/devices made with TiO2 or Ag NPs. The stable output voltage of the SC device 
made with Ag/TiO2 nanocomposite was 0.49 V. When the Ag/N-doped TiO2 nanocomposite was 
added to the SCs, the capacitance and energy densities were reduced to 208.3 2 F g-1 and 41.6 
Wh kg-1 (with respect to the device made with Ag/TiO2 nanocomposite), but the output voltage is 
enhanced to 1.91 V. Hence, the results presented here suggest that adding Ag/TiO2 
nanocomposites on flexible SCs could be an alternative to stabilize their output voltage, this in 
turn, opens the possibility for their use in portable/wearable applications. "
205-intro.txt.txt,"With the rapid development of portable electronic devices recently, smaller size and 
longer service life has been the most concerns that should be realized in the design of new 
product. Supercapacitors, also called electric double layer capacitors, have attracted much 
attention recently since they exhibit intriguing features like high power capabilities, long 
cycling performace and rapid charge/discharge rates, which are attractive alternatives to

batteries.1-3 However, the low discharge capacitance of supercapacitors, compared to Li-ion 
batteries, has seriously restricted the prospect of its practical application. Li-ion capacitors, 
assembled by Li-ion battery-type and capacitor-type electrodes, are expected to possess 
superiorities of both batteries (high energy density) and capacitors (rate performance, long 
cycling stability).4
 Battery-type faradic capacitive electrodes coupled with electric double 
layer capacitive electrodes can increase the energy density and avoid large capacitance loss 
after long-term cycling or at high discharge density5
 by enlarging the operating potential 
window and employing the high-capacity electrodes.6
 The creation of oxygen vacancies in 
metal oxides has become a popular strategy to promote electrochemical properties of 
electrocatalysts and electrodes in SCs or batteries .6-8
Among different manganese materials, MnO possesses high theoretical capacity(760 mA 
h/g) based on the redox reaction and even gets the higher measured values of capacity due to 
the strong interphase interaction. Moreover, it has many attractive advantages that benifit for 
electrical properties such as low conversion potential, low voltage hysteresis and low 
electrochemical motivation force.9,10 Spinel-type transition metal oxides such as NiMn2O4
11 
and NiCo2O4
12 have been favorable due to their high specific capacity, good cycling stability 
and abundant sources. Spinel-type LiMn2O4 possesses many attractive advantages in cathode 
materials such as high theory capacity, low cost, nontoxicity and so on.13 Usually, using 
organic electrolytes14,15 and ionic liquids16 in LiMn2O4 based energy storage devices can 
reach wider operating potential windows. However, the application of organic electrolytes 
always generated a series of problems such as low ionic conductivity, flammability, narrow 
temperature regimes, high cost, corrosiveness, unsafety and disposal haza.3,17 Furthermore, 
LiMn2O4 always suffered from fast capacitance decay during long-term cycling process 
because of the dissolution of Mn and structural degradation resulted from Jahn-Teller 
distortion of octahedra MnO6 within LiMn2O4 lattice.14,18 Solutions to retard Mn dissolution 
include structure modification19 and cation doping.20-22 Two-dimensional thin film LiMn2O4

suffered from limited contact area and low efficiency of Li+
 ion diffusion inside the bulk 
material.19,23 Therefore, the power of two-dimensional (2D) configurations in LiMn2O4
energy-storage devices is insufficient. Three dimensional (3D)-architecture LiMn2O4
electrode materials possess plenty of highlights such as efficient axial electron transport on 
the interface between active material and current collector, high specific surface area that 
contains abundant redox sites and fast Li+
 ion intercalation/deintercalation process through 
shortened ion diffusion pathway.14,23 Although abundant works have been done on fabricating 
3D structure LiMn2O4 of nanorods/nanowires23,24 or nanosheets14 with enhanced 
electrochemical energy storage performance, reports of self-assembly 3D-architecture 
materials that directly grow on the surface of conductive substrate as well with higher active 
mass, specific surface area and Li+
 ion transport efficiency are still very limited.
Many synthesis methods of LiMn2O4 have been reported, such as hydrothermal 
synthesis25, sol-gel26, electrostatic spray deposition27 and so on. However, all these methods 
possess increased fabrication cost due to uncontrollable morphology, high equipment 
requirements and extreme synthesis condition. Electrochemical deposition is a practical way 
to synthesis of self-assembly 3D-architecture LiMn2O4 with the advantages of moderate 
synthesis temperature, decreased cost and limited impurities, for example the LiMn2O4 thin 
films on gold foil.15 This method also can fabricate electrode materials with reasonable
thickness and uniformity because of the rigid control of deposition rate, raw material ratio and 
environment temperature. Moreover, direct electrodeposition of electrode materials on the 
conductive substrate can enhance electric contact at the interface of electrode materials and 
conductive substrate.28,29
Herein, a novel hybrid electrode of 3D LiMnxOy@C (LMO@C) nanosheet arrays on the 
current collector of Ni foam was developed for high-performance Li-ion capacitors by 
combination of electrochemical deposition, hydrothermal method and thermal pyrolysis. 3D 
γ-MnO2 nanosheet arrays was facially electrodeposited on conductive Ni foam firstly,

following one-step “hydrothermal lithiation” process to form LiMnxOy nanosheet arrays 
composite. Subsequently, a carbon layer on the surface of LiMnxOy nanosheet arrays was 
friendly converted with glucose to, and plenty of oxygen vacancies in metal oxides were 
simultaneously generated, leading to the high-performance 3D LMO@C nanosheet array 
electrode materials. γ-MnO2 exhibits the best electrochemical performance as an electrode 
material among all these polymorphs of MnO2 in the battery industry.30 The 3D LMO@C 
nanosheet arrays with rich oxygen vacancies exhibits high reversible specific capacity, 
excellent long-term cycling stability and good rate performance, which can be utilized as 
promising cathodes in flexible 3D-architecture devices. The assembled LMO@C//activated 
carbon (AC) LIC coin cell, coupling the Ni foam@LMO@C and Ni foam@AC electrodes as 
cathode and anode, respectively, delivers a promising high energy and high power density of 
44.3 Wh g-1 and 8000 W kg-1, respectively. Additionally, the LIC possesses 80% of its initial 
capacitance value after 4000 cycles at 5 A g-1. Such an electrochemical performance of LIC is 
mainly attributed to oxygen vacancies, thin carbon layer, and the integrated 3D-structure Ni 
foam@LMO@C with a large specific surface area. The 3D Ni foam@LMO@C, as a binderfree electrode, exhibits the practical application prospect for energy storage s"
